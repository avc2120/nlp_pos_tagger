time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties
vehicles was a personal _RARE_ for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly _RARE_
principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly
other than employee need contributed to the growth
immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees
of increase does not _RARE_ anything in itself
not indicate loose management , _RARE_ controls or poor policy
does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees
past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now
were too few automobiles in _RARE_ or too many now is _RARE_
is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them
operation of the motor pool
origin of state-owned automobiles may be _RARE_ , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly
1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned
included all phases of management
determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where _RARE_ and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters
, however , the nation was at war
automobile tires were _RARE_ commodities
was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual
these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more _RARE_ called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation
pool then , as now , had _RARE_ facilities in Providence and other _RARE_ located throughout the state
_RARE_ the responsibility of the Department of Public _RARE_ and was financed on a _RARE_ fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the _RARE_ operation
the _RARE_ operation was transferred to the _RARE_ Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and _RARE_ department of the state government
of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : `` Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made
of government are now _RARE_ for the actual cost of services provided to each _RARE_ car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars
maintenance _RARE_ fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the _RARE_ system plus other control _RARE_ has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis
of the _RARE_ of the new management is found in the fact that during the period _RARE_ , while total annual _RARE_ put on the vehicles increased _RARE_ , the total maintenance cost increased only _RARE_
order to further _RARE_ the management of _RARE_ vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by _RARE_ Order , to the Division of _RARE_ , Research and Office _RARE_
behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles
: So far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division )
in closely with the current attempt to _RARE_ state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive
it allows the present management to _RARE_ vehicles so that _RARE_ will be more _RARE_ distributed throughout the _RARE_ ; ; for example , if one driver puts on _RARE_ miles per year and another driver _RARE_ miles per year , their cars will be switched so that both cars will have _RARE_ miles after two years , rather than _RARE_ miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and _RARE_ miles respectively ''
pool is a completely centralized and _RARE_ operation
all types of vehicle maintenance , but _RARE_ more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs
with outside repair _RARE_ for much of the latter work
pool _RARE_ is in its compilation of maintenance and _RARE_ studies and analyses
reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per _RARE_ of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be _RARE_ for sound _RARE_
, motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data
, vehicles averaged an operating cost of _RARE_ per mile
this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles _RARE_ is more economical by state car than by payment of _RARE_ for use of _RARE_ vehicles
further that with sufficient experience and when _RARE_ of _RARE_ cars is compiled , the _RARE_ point may be reduced to _RARE_ miles of travel per year
shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random
of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities
quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , _RARE_ and , in general , make for _RARE_ operation in terms of _RARE_ of personnel and _RARE_ of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment
would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more

of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state
made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made
evaluated by the Division of _RARE_ with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible _RARE_
for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public
are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal _RARE_ or state sales tax to pay
the state was also entitled to a special type of _RARE_ discount through the _RARE_
ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the _RARE_ fund mentioned earlier
a normal governmental procedure which _RARE_ more accurately _RARE_ principles
and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later
, assignment , and use policies Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles
role in policy determination in this area for years has been _RARE_ almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated _RARE_ for the purchase and operation of vehicles
meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration
Island property tax There was a time some years ago when local _RARE_ by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well
years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the _RARE_ of the general property tax
was discontinued in _RARE_
time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial _RARE_ on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years
same time there has been an _RARE_ and expansion of municipal services as well
there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments
assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , _RARE_ for their requirements
have developed several forms of _RARE_ and shared taxes , as well as the _RARE_ grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level
aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by _RARE_ the property tax
being done both by the _RARE_ of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property _RARE_ neglected or ignored
tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office _RARE_ , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the _RARE_ of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property
_RARE_ personal property
many problems in the _RARE_ of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) _RARE_ , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value
are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states
property
laws of the various states , in general , specify the _RARE_ of property , i.e. , residence or _RARE_ of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper _RARE_ point for assessment
law _RARE_ that all real estate is _RARE_ in the town in which it is situated
provides for the _RARE_ of all personal property , belonging to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and _RARE_ , and the tangible personal property of _RARE_ in this state
personal property , it specifically _RARE_ `` all ships or vessels , at home or abroad ''
is _RARE_ wherever the owner has a place of _RARE_ the greater portion of the year
similar _RARE_ for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is _RARE_ out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property '' situated or being in any town is _RARE_ where the property is situated
seem to fix the tax _RARE_ of all movable personal property at its location on December 31
and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles
of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is _RARE_
it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the _RARE_ day of December
of the acceptance _RARE_ the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft
example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport _RARE_ in _RARE_ , to the North Central _RARE_ in _RARE_
resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably _RARE_
its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all _RARE_ property , both tangible and _RARE_ , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of _RARE_ for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year ''
tax _RARE_ , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated ''
value
of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to _RARE_ in that the determination of fair _RARE_ is dependent on local assessors , who in general are _RARE_ and _RARE_ personnel taking an _RARE_ approach to the problem
for the wide _RARE_ in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island
will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through _RARE_ agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted
Island Public _RARE_ Council in its publication once _RARE_ : `` The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all _RARE_ property
_RARE_ and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable _RARE_ on all properties throughout the State
statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and _RARE_ that are inherent in a system of _RARE_ different and independent assessing units ''
of Public Administration , in its report to the State _RARE_ _RARE_ Commission in 1959 , recommended `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency _RARE_ organized and equipped for the job ''
_RARE_ , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of _RARE_ counties as large or larger than Rhode Island ''
Rhode Island
the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island
from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case
_RARE_ reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town
of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time
to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not
of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations
checked boats only , another _RARE_ and _RARE_ , one mentioned house _RARE_ , and two others referred to _RARE_ without _RARE_ the type
cases , airplanes only were indicated
difficult to _RARE_ exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not _RARE_ movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are _RARE_ for tax purposes
indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats
seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be _RARE_ for that particular kind of personal property
answered the question relating to their efforts to _RARE_ movable property that the results are _RARE_
towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind
interest is a question as to whether movable property was _RARE_ according to its location or ownership
that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer
stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property , and only five were opposed
expressed no opinion
point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now
not clear , however , whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats , _RARE_ , aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be _RARE_ to their particular towns
that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner
for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner _RARE_
made no reply
who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred
one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date
, it may be said that there is no one _RARE_ practice in Rhode Island with respect to the _RARE_ of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge
for greater knowledge is evident from their _RARE_
personal property _RARE_ of boats
been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of _RARE_ boats
Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a _RARE_ upon real and personal property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than '' a specified amount as ordered by a city _RARE_ or financial town meeting
been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach
professional organization , the Rhode Island _RARE_ _RARE_ Association the question of _RARE_ boats long has been _RARE_ and discussed
solution has been found , but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or _RARE_ on the part of the assessors
been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats
obvious that this is a potential and _RARE_ source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to _RARE_
known that at least five towns ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Newport and _RARE_ ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes
few are taxed , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town _RARE_
really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be
than _RARE_ boats were registered with the Coast _RARE_ prior to the recent passage of the state _RARE_ law
few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of _RARE_ and _RARE_ at the end of the 1960 _RARE_ season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a _RARE_ brought the season to an early close
association , meeting at _RARE_ in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem
investment in Rhode Island was the big story in _RARE_ industrial development effort
started or committed themselves to new plant construction , _RARE_ _RARE_ square feet and representing an investment of _RARE_ ; ; a new _RARE_ War 2 , record
exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here
these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business _RARE_ throughout the nation , Rhode Island _RARE_ marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs
major _RARE_ in 1960 , three were financed under the R. _RARE_ Industrial _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ mortgage plan : _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ Corporation , and American _RARE_ & _RARE_
that arranged their own financing included _RARE_ Corporation , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ Division of _RARE_ , _RARE_ Gray _RARE_ _RARE_ , W. R. Cobb Company , and _RARE_ _RARE_ Company
_RARE_ of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development _RARE_ Industrial Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation
personnel worked with _RARE_ out-of-state and _RARE_ Rhode Island concerns during 1960 , many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location
conscious of this _RARE_ new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island
small business Although much of the Industrial _RARE_ _RARE_ effort is devoted to _RARE_ new locations and _RARE_ by major industries , small business is also _RARE_ considerable attention
of Foreign and _RARE_ Commerce carries on a vigorous program , directly aimed at _RARE_ and _RARE_ the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories
function is the operation of a Government _RARE_ Center , which receives _RARE_ daily from the Federal Government's principal _RARE_ agencies
rendered to interested Rhode Island _RARE_ concerning interpretation of _RARE_ _RARE_ , where to obtain _RARE_ , and _RARE_ concerning _RARE_
past year , _RARE_ government _RARE_ _RARE_ were received and _RARE_ procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers
, the _RARE_ domestic trade program provided _RARE_ services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ; ; how and where to apply for financial assistance ; ; details on _RARE_ ; ; information concerning _RARE_ , _RARE_ and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business
of Foreign and _RARE_ Commerce is also active in the field of international trade , _RARE_ Rhode Island firms in developing and _RARE_ markets abroad
_RARE_ with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; ; locating foreign agents , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , etc. ; ; information on foreign and domestic _RARE_ duties and regulations , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and _RARE_ requirements concerning _RARE_ shipments and arrangements for payment
year 1960 , this office supplied _RARE_ visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made _RARE_ field visits
Our _RARE_ advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such _RARE_ as _RARE_ financing , plant _RARE_ , and location advantages
continued to run a series of ads _RARE_ _RARE_ of Rhode Island by _RARE_ who had recently established new plants here
a still greater audience of _RARE_ manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from _RARE_ to _RARE_ , and the Industrial _RARE_ _RARE_ financial participation was _RARE_ from _RARE_ to _RARE_
was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the _RARE_ Street Journal ( Eastern and _RARE_ _RARE_ ) which averaged two prominent ads per month , and to a _RARE_ degree the New York Herald _RARE_ and , for the west coast , the Los Angeles Times and the _RARE_ Street Journal ( Pacific Coast edition )
to the regular schedule , _RARE_ were run for maximum impact in special _RARE_ of the New York Times , Boston Herald , American _RARE_ , _RARE_ News and , for local promotion , the Providence Sunday Journal
included _RARE_ _RARE_ , The New _RARE_ , U. S. _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_
mail campaign consisted of 3 _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , _RARE_ , and business machine manufacturers , and to _RARE_
_RARE_ pieces of correspondence
advertising campaign brought a total of _RARE_ inquiries ; ; _RARE_ from _RARE_ and 75 from direct mail
and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries
led in the number of inquiries , followed by California , New Jersey , _RARE_ , and Pennsylvania
countries _RARE_ were Germany , Canada , _RARE_ and India
An important operation in _RARE_ industrial locations involves what we term `` _RARE_ calls '' by one of this _RARE_ industrial promotion _RARE_
of visits , without previous _RARE_ , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly _RARE_ areas
25 carefully selected cities were visited , including New York , _RARE_ , Long Island City , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , New _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Boston , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
a total of _RARE_ calls , _RARE_ contacts were established with top executive personnel
_RARE_ out-of-state visitors interested in _RARE_ Rhode _RARE_ industrial advantages , and Industrial Division personnel made _RARE_ out-of-state follow-up visits
During 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the Development _RARE_ Industrial Division
, the Office of Foreign and _RARE_ Commerce -- in conjunction with local trade _RARE_ , _RARE_ of commerce , and bank officials -- sponsored a World _RARE_ Conference at the _RARE_ Hotel
was to find ways of _RARE_ the United _RARE_ declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959
representatives of business attended this _RARE_ and the R. _RARE_ _RARE_ Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event
_RARE_ of last year , the Industrial Division sponsored the _RARE_ Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry _RARE_ School
program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted _RARE_ interested individuals
included addresses by _RARE_ Miller , Jr. of the U. S. _RARE_ of Commerce
, executive director of the New _RARE_ State Planning and Development Commission , and _RARE_ C. _RARE_ of General _RARE_ Company
in the afternoon _RARE_ development _RARE_ from Pennsylvania , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and rounded out a _RARE_ program
with this conference , a _RARE_ supplement was published in the October _RARE_ edition of The Providence Sunday Journal
the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division
_RARE_ copies have been sent out to prospective _RARE_
publications Other special _RARE_ by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the _RARE_ Conference , letters and _RARE_ to _RARE_ at _RARE_ Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and _RARE_ of industrial _RARE_ to such organizations as Society of Industrial _RARE_
of the R. _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ were distributed : _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ out-of-state
Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial _RARE_ , `` Rhode Island -- Right For _RARE_ '' , and prepared copy for a new edition of the _RARE_ Of _RARE_ ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space _RARE_
activities included _RARE_ the _RARE_ program for _RARE_ _RARE_ , the new _RARE_ post office , and a conference with representatives of Brown University , Providence College , and University of Rhode Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the _RARE_ of a training program for electronics personnel
_RARE_ in its _RARE_ terms , the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island
of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the _RARE_ act of the Development Council , which _RARE_ to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning
ago , the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` _RARE_ _RARE_ In _RARE_ Rhode Island
result of an _RARE_ review of the recommendations contained in this report , plus an analysis of our own _RARE_ act , the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a _RARE_ of its work program
are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division
) First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state
) _RARE_ the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that `` _RARE_ Planning ( in Rhode Island ) means , or should mean , state planning '' , the state guide plan will take into account the _RARE_ nature of many of Rhode _RARE_ problems
) It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government
end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff
) The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ; ; among the operating departments of the state ; ; between the cities and towns of the state ; ; and on a regional basis between the six New England states
) On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such as water ) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan
) The state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan
) In preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of _RARE_ the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation
planning division carries out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ; ; and the preparation of the state development budget
planning The planning division has _RARE_ on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation
aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation
program , as it was _RARE_ proposed , was to take five years to complete
-- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide _RARE_ study of the Department of Public _RARE_ -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated
mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961
Since accurate base _RARE_ are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to _RARE_ the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base _RARE_ -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to _RARE_ feet , covering the entire state
_RARE_ completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started
the aid of matching federal funds available under Section _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Act of 1954 as amended , the planning division began a one year program July 1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program
consists of four items : urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public utility service areas
validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible
land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of _RARE_ and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning
land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and _RARE_ all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use
of important physical features such as _RARE_ and types of soil and the collection of all available information _RARE_ to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961
collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose
in Rhode island
not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island
a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government
_RARE_ special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County _RARE_ _RARE_ )
special purpose governments have the authority to _RARE_ taxes , to _RARE_ money , own property , sue and be _RARE_ , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers
and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of _RARE_
not an _RARE_ to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government
to the collection of service charges , the special districts _RARE_ annual property taxes of approximately _RARE_
in other states comparative data
of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report
the findings are : 1
, including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30
four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( _RARE_ 30 ) , New York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and _RARE_ ( August 31 )

states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , _RARE_ , California , Delaware , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , New Mexico , North _RARE_ , North _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii )

states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , New _RARE_ , New Jersey , Ohio , South _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Washington , and _RARE_ )

states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 : : ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Kentucky , _RARE_ , Maryland , _RARE_ , Virginia , and South _RARE_ )

, Alabama , _RARE_ its fiscal year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on September 30

its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30

its fiscal year on May 31
its cities close their fiscal years on December 31
twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments
only Illinois , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and Rhode Island have a situation in which the _RARE_ units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity
: advantages and _RARE_ advantages
summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently
among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1
fiscal year requires _RARE_ with common sense administration of local _RARE_ : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending

fiscal year _RARE_ _RARE_ with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn
towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash _RARE_

fiscal year _RARE_ more careful _RARE_ and _RARE_ control over expenditures
the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures

fiscal year brings the _RARE_ fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which _RARE_ the largest share of local _RARE_
_RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ and financial reporting

fiscal year _RARE_ interest charges on money _RARE_ in the form of tax anticipation notes
tax _RARE_ not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term _RARE_ notes , _RARE_ the _RARE_ miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax _RARE_

fiscal year _RARE_ _RARE_ comparison of revenues and expenditures
have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful _RARE_ ; ; and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases
different fiscal years are difficult to compare
advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes
anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times
be by bank loans , sale of notes or _RARE_ , or by the somewhat casual method of _RARE_ and registration of _RARE_
event it is a form of _RARE_ which could be and should be rendered unnecessary
would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most
of _RARE_ can be reduced to a minimum if _RARE_ _RARE_ payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year
toward such a system looks toward saving and security
be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful _RARE_ reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year
federal and state governments _RARE_ their fiscal years on July 1
of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below : It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced _RARE_ from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great _RARE_ ; ; but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true
fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient _RARE_ revenue and expenditure relationships

are many sound reasons for _RARE_ uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered
more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual _RARE_ to the principle
is a matter of shifting dates ; ; the other , is how to finance the transition
be done about the changing of dates
an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars
means a confused and _RARE_ _RARE_ public for a period of time
and understanding between local officials and the _RARE_ help _RARE_ this problem
problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns
be covered more fully later
be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can _RARE_ to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city
there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change
have to be made in some cases , but it is to the _RARE_ advantage to finance the _RARE_ for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes _RARE_
fiscal calendars The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well _RARE_ fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to _RARE_ effort to secure them
of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed
are immediately evident
the present situation is too varied to be _RARE_ by any single formula
the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns
at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; ; the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary
matter is considered in detail in a later section
and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform _RARE_ coordinated fiscal tax year calendar
from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end
important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them
of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought
it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved
needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below
needed
and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it
is required for these towns
include : _RARE_ , Lincoln , _RARE_ , Newport , North _RARE_ , and South _RARE_
fiscal year
and one city , _RARE_ and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only
will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax _RARE_ due and _RARE_ in the fiscal year _RARE_ within that year
tax collection year
and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity
and towns include _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Central _RARE_ , and _RARE_

to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an _RARE_
excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars
neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year
to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them
both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 , they could _RARE_ taxes for an _RARE_ period of nine months , _RARE_ with September 30 and ending with June 30
_RARE_ dates would be : October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston )
start their new fiscal year on July 1
collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ; ; and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston )
plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same _RARE_ periods

twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30
these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years
adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3
financing adjustments _RARE_ from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary
be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of _RARE_ _RARE_ do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements
communities there is simply no financial problem ; ; it is only a matter of adjusting _RARE_ methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques
municipalities the difficulties in _RARE_ the financial burden have been sufficiently great to _RARE_ _RARE_ of fiscal year changes
such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule
earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars
, no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition
practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ; each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the _RARE_ , and the length of the transition interval
range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to _RARE_ and require _RARE_ ranging from short-term _RARE_ notes to long-term bonds
problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the _RARE_ or adjustment period
communities which have financial difficulties in _RARE_ adjustments , there are a number of _RARE_ any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem

_RARE_ on _RARE_ and International _RARE_ was provided samples of visual aids on first aid and personal health produced by the Medical Illustration Service

( 10,000 copies each ) of the `` Atlas Of _RARE_ Pathology '' were completed during the period of this report
_RARE_ Of Pathology This consists of 25 individual _RARE_ , two of which were added during fiscal years _RARE_ ( The _RARE_ Of Forensic Pathology and The _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ )
are sponsored by 18 national medical , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ societies and have as their mission the _RARE_ of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural history of various diseases of _RARE_ importance
_RARE_ Of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis , under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the National Research Council and The _RARE_ General of the Army , Navy , and Air Force
utilized the collected material in these _RARE_ for numerous _RARE_ to national and international meetings , exhibits , and published studies
period of this report , _RARE_ new cases were entered into the various _RARE_
selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes
same period , six new _RARE_ of the Atlas Of _RARE_ Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers _RARE_
_RARE_ copies of _RARE_ sold and _RARE_ copies distributed free during this period
_RARE_ _RARE_ were prepared , bringing the total to _RARE_ available for loan distribution
teaching _RARE_ Conference sets were prepared , which makes a total of 70 types of teaching sets for loan
period , _RARE_ teaching sets were distributed on loan
_RARE_ have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military _RARE_
for teaching sets continues _RARE_ since they provide the means for the military _RARE_ to review the pathology of selected disease processes or _RARE_ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes
Museum In fiscal year 1959 , the Medical Museum was moved to _RARE_ Hall , a temporary building on Independence Avenue at _RARE_ Street , _RARE_ , and continued to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical _RARE_
period of this report , _RARE_ panel exhibits _RARE_ the latest developments in medical research were _RARE_
_RARE_ exhibits ( of all types ) shown , _RARE_ were new or _RARE_
_RARE_ specimens newly mounted or _RARE_ , _RARE_ were prepared for other agencies
were _RARE_ for study purposes
, `` _RARE_ -- An _RARE_ Art , A New Science '' , was presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association
exhibit _RARE_ `` A _RARE_ Of Naval _RARE_ '' was formally presented to The Director by George S. _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of E. R. _RARE_ and Sons , for permanent display in the Museum
provided for _RARE_ guest medical exhibits , and the Museum collected new _RARE_ of _RARE_ , medical , _RARE_ , and diagnostic instruments , uniform , and similar items of historical _RARE_ significance
period , the laboratory rendered centralized _RARE_ service to qualified _RARE_
mounted for military installations , governmental agencies , and medical schools
five copies of the _RARE_ Of _RARE_ _RARE_ were distributed
and civilian students received laboratory training
years 1959 and 1960 , there were _RARE_ visitors to the Museum
period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 , the Medical Museum was required to move to _RARE_ _RARE_ `` S '' on the _RARE_ from _RARE_ Hall
period and during the movement operation , the Museum continued its functional support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
Medical Publication _RARE_ The Armed Forces Medical Publication _RARE_ , established in 1949 , has published , since January _RARE_ , The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a _RARE_ publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services
, The Medical _RARE_ Bulletin , supplied similar material to _RARE_ medical personnel
replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin , published continuously from _RARE_ through 1959 , as well as the _RARE_ Hospital Corps _RARE_ and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department , published from _RARE_ to 1949
, their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a _RARE_ Air Force medical _RARE_
_RARE_ resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a _RARE_ basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate _RARE_ for each service , were between _RARE_ and _RARE_
on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of _RARE_ to several additional _RARE_ of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage
July 1958 to 30 June 1960 , 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published
contained articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devoted to military medical news , _RARE_ of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services
on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled , `` This Is Your _RARE_ ''
the October 1959 issue of the Journal , the method of production of copy for _RARE_ _RARE_ was changed from _RARE_ to hot _RARE_
in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major _RARE_ to keep within the total of _RARE_ funds
of 100 instead of _RARE_ substance paper plus the adoption of side _RARE_ beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly _RARE_ in _RARE_ funds
issues were published , one for November 1959 on _RARE_ _RARE_ , the other the _RARE_ _RARE_ issue for January 1960
1960 issue marked the _RARE_ of the section entitled , `` The Medical _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
discontinued Medical _RARE_ Bulletin , publication of which was suspended with the _RARE_ 1959 issue , a section called `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' was _RARE_ on a _RARE_ basis beginning with the April 1960 issue
were published on historical medicine , special reports , _RARE_ , and `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
1960 , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the `` Medical Museum '' , and in June , the Institute started contributing a regular monthly `` _RARE_ For _RARE_ ''
also planned to furnish a regular series of articles , beginning in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant _RARE_ _RARE_
Forces _RARE_ Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 _RARE_ , so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces
report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal
achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete _RARE_ in a bomb _RARE_ of a metal in _RARE_ when the product is relatively _RARE_
gave a heat of formation of aluminum _RARE_ which closely _RARE_ a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and _RARE_ this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago
are being _RARE_ to _RARE_ a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important _RARE_ product , _RARE_ _RARE_
and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is _RARE_ completion
of these , an _RARE_ device to study systems _RARE_ up to _RARE_ Af and 100 _RARE_ pressure , a major goal was achieved
of measuring the total electrical energy entering an _RARE_ wire during a few _RARE_ was _RARE_ when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent
is considered very good for such short time intervals
of calibration _RARE_ a fixed resistance element as a _RARE_
is inserted in the discharge _RARE_ in place of the _RARE_ wire , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the element is measured with high accuracy
used as a reference for _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element
_RARE_ has been developed in order to permit _RARE_ observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion
consists of two parts : a _RARE_ part and a _RARE_ part
method , the _RARE_ action is obtained from the _RARE_ of a window by _RARE_ a series of parallel lead wires
of the _RARE_ consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera
action is obtained when a _RARE_ , charged to high voltage , is suddenly _RARE_ through the foil
discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll _RARE_ toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera
shown that the _RARE_ is 75 percent open in about _RARE_ _RARE_
aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil
of _RARE_ radio spectra
well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm _RARE_ , the spectra of _RARE_ radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small _RARE_
and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on _RARE_ gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary _RARE_
most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ ; ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Aj
concentrations of these _RARE_ should be detectable ; ; in _RARE_ gas , concentrations as low as Af _RARE_ per Af may be sufficient , as compared to the Af hydrogen _RARE_ Af required for detection of the _RARE_ line
in radio _RARE_ is achieved by reducing the _RARE_ of the receiver ; ; therefore , only with precise _RARE_ of the line frequencies is an _RARE_ search for the radio spectra of these _RARE_ feasible
precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical _RARE_ _RARE_ has been started
methods are _RARE_ at the low frequencies of these molecular _RARE_ , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead
the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor , which _RARE_ the _RARE_ spectra to a _RARE_ high _RARE_ range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity
_RARE_ _RARE_ investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the _RARE_ radical
this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which _RARE_ may be identified in _RARE_ gas ; ; the frequencies are _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af , with an uncertainty of _RARE_ Af
observing these spectral lines has so far , apparently , been _RARE_ to the laboratory ; ; _RARE_ observations have yet to be reported
being made for similar experiments on _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_
is _RARE_ an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af
and _RARE_ fall into three main categories : absolute _RARE_ based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary _RARE_ involving _RARE_ studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and _RARE_ _RARE_ measurements ( see p. _RARE_ )

_RARE_ has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the _RARE_ fluid , to measure temperatures near _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af
_RARE_ provides a means of absolute temperature measurement , and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer
of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid _RARE_ vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 _RARE_ respectively were found
is preliminary , and work is continuing

and _RARE_ germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region
resistors have been _RARE_ _RARE_ from 300 to _RARE_ Af and their _RARE_ have been found to be _RARE_ within _RARE_ _RARE_ when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose _RARE_ is _RARE_ through most of the liquid helium
of the resistors have been made from _RARE_ to _RARE_ Af at every _RARE_ Af
standard _RARE_ of the data for two of the resistors were 1 _RARE_ ; ; and for the third _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
method
of helium _RARE_ thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from _RARE_ to _RARE_ Af
_RARE_ have been found to exist in liquid helium _RARE_ contained in _RARE_ and _RARE_ metallic storage _RARE_
was about one half of a _RARE_ at _RARE_ Af but increased to several _RARE_ for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point
head _RARE_ has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium
the surface temperature gradient can produce _RARE_ _RARE_ measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless _RARE_ are taken to _RARE_ the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface
also been observed , in helium 2 , that large _RARE_ can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer
been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer
case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow
for _RARE_ measurements
measurements on _RARE_ _RARE_ are dependent on a sensitive yet _RARE_ pressure _RARE_
which _RARE_ the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested
is a _RARE_ instrument and _RARE_ a stretched diaphragm , _RARE_ _RARE_ thick and 1 _RARE_ in diameter
pressure _RARE_ _RARE_ the diaphragm and changes the _RARE_ between the diaphragm and an _RARE_ _RARE_ plate _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ apart ( for Af )
backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from _RARE_ the _RARE_ limit
temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to _RARE_ _RARE_ , an _RARE_ of 300 _RARE_ , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one _RARE_ of _RARE_
of air
study of the transport properties of air at _RARE_ temperatures has been completed
was carried out under _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Division of the Air Research and Development Command , U.S. Air Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding
effect discovered during the study is the existence of _RARE_ numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen _RARE_ region
discovered is the large _RARE_ of thermal diffusion _RARE_ to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences _RARE_ the nitrogen _RARE_ region are present
of the study , based on _RARE_ _RARE_ computed from the latest _RARE_ evaluated data on _RARE_ forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal _RARE_ , thermal diffusion , and diffusion _RARE_ at temperatures of _RARE_ to 10,000 Af and of _RARE_ of pressure in _RARE_ from Af to Af times normal density
activities
, 1961 , representatives of the national _RARE_ of _RARE_ , Canada , The _RARE_ , United _RARE_ , _RARE_ , United States , and West Germany , met at the _RARE_ to _RARE_ means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and _RARE_ Af
first step toward this goal , arrangements were worked out for _RARE_ the _RARE_ now in use through _RARE_ of a group of standard _RARE_ resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory
group of thermometers was obtained and _RARE_ at the Aj
have now been sent to the United _RARE_ for calibration at the National _RARE_ Laboratory

last week of _RARE_ 1961 , _RARE_ , Ohio was the site of the _RARE_ Symposium on _RARE_ , Its _RARE_ And Control In Science And _RARE_
, which was _RARE_ sponsored by the American Institute of _RARE_ , the _RARE_ Society of America , and the National Bureau of _RARE_ , attracted nearly one thousand _RARE_ , including many from abroad
contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. _RARE_ , General _RARE_ , and Dr. C. M. _RARE_ , Program _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ Director , opened the _RARE_ session with _RARE_ remarks , following which a total of _RARE_ papers were given throughout the week by _RARE_ _RARE_ , from both the Washington and _RARE_ _RARE_

In addition to the basic programs in _RARE_ standards , _RARE_ , solid state _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has _RARE_ its activities in laboratory _RARE_

centers have been established for the collection , _RARE_ , critical evaluation , and _RARE_ of _RARE_ and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and _RARE_ cross sections


_RARE_ of the Office of Naval Research and the _RARE_ Research _RARE_ _RARE_ , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities
survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately _RARE_ references was _RARE_
and tables of available data are now in preparation
_RARE_ arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen
will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements
of the hydrogen line _RARE_ indicates that a measurement of these _RARE_ can be used to _RARE_ a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent
of tables containing spectral _RARE_ for _RARE_ lines of 70 elements , as observed in a _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ arc , was completed and published
the intensity data indicate that they may be _RARE_ to approximate transition probabilities
are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned , but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas
levels
on the very complex spectra of the rare earth elements
and _RARE_ techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success

, for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large _RARE_ areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have
of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government _RARE_ highway and air _RARE_ , to name but two
solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete _RARE_ of this important service
been a number of sound plans proposed
of these has been _RARE_
have stood _RARE_ by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand
number of people flowing in and out of our _RARE_ areas each day has increased _RARE_ since World War 2 , , total annual rail _RARE_ dropped _RARE_ million for 1947 to 1957
this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area
New York Central _RARE_ , one of the _RARE_ most important _RARE_ , has alone lost _RARE_ percent of its _RARE_ since 1949
time of crisis in our _RARE_ commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the _RARE_ & Ohio _RARE_ proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads
York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C. & O. - B. & O. _RARE_ a total of _RARE_ points served in common with the New York Central
is this kind of _RARE_ _RARE_ , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area
York Central notes : `` The freight traffic most _RARE_ to _RARE_ by the C. & O. - B. & O. provides the _RARE_ of _RARE_ revenues
make it possible to provide essential freight and _RARE_ service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services
services are to be maintained , the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible ''
York Central today _RARE_ 60 percent of all _RARE_ commuter traffic coming into New York City
a _RARE_ million operation involving _RARE_ employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively
to this phase of the _RARE_ operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself , but to the _RARE_ people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably _RARE_ transportation in and out of the city
is a _RARE_ alternative to this _RARE_ dangerous and _RARE_ C. & O. - B. & O. merger scheme '' -- The Central has pointed out
logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive _RARE_ railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. & O. was publicly committed to the approach _RARE_ here
of the plan were well _RARE_
from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that _RARE_ would result which would be of _RARE_ benefit to the railroads concerned , their _RARE_ , their customers , their users , and to the public at large
_RARE_ the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. & O. entered _RARE_ _RARE_ with C. & O. which resulted in the present situation
light of the facts at hand , however , New York Central _RARE_ to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy _RARE_ eastern railroad structure in the public interest ''
Commerce Commission will _RARE_ its _RARE_ on the proposed C. & O. - B. & O. merger on June 18
the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further _RARE_ its commuter operations by giving _RARE_ competitive advantages to the lines that wish to _RARE_
there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss
, will it serve the long-range public interest
past 40 years Congress has _RARE_ a carefully planned , balanced and competitive _RARE_ system
ask ourselves which of the two _RARE_ will help the commuter -- the _RARE_ B. & O. - C. & O. merger , or the _RARE_ New York Central - B. & O. - C. & O. merger
serve not only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public

, I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New York Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command
_RARE_ has been a distinguished _RARE_ of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American _RARE_ on the occasion of his _RARE_
pleased to note that Mr. _RARE_ will continue to serve as _RARE_ of the board of the New York Times
successor as _RARE_ is Mr. _RARE_ E. _RARE_ , who is president of the New York Times Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942
outstanding career as a _RARE_ _RARE_ that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's great newspapers will be maintained
also pleased to note that Mr. John B. _RARE_ , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor
_RARE_ Charles _RARE_ , editor since _RARE_ , who now becomes editor _RARE_
like at this time , Mr. _RARE_ , to pay warm tribute to Arthur _RARE_ _RARE_ and Charles _RARE_ on the occasion of their _RARE_ from distinguished _RARE_ in American _RARE_
_RARE_ go to their _RARE_ , _RARE_ E. _RARE_ and John B. _RARE_ , who can be counted upon to sustain the _RARE_ tradition of the New York Times
of the _RARE_ District of New York , and I as their _RARE_ in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and _RARE_ newspapers of the world

, in my latest _RARE_ to my constituents I urged the _RARE_ of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of _RARE_ continued Soviet _RARE_ from coming into the Western _RARE_ in violation of the Monroe Doctrine
I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its _RARE_
to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my _RARE_ , together with the text of the article from the U.S. News & World Report : `` your _RARE_ , Samuel S. _RARE_ , reports from Washington , May 1 , 1961
: Whatever may have been the _RARE_ resulting from the _RARE_ attempt of the Cuban _RARE_ to establish a _RARE_ on the _RARE_ _RARE_ last week , there was at least one positive benefit , and that was the _RARE_ _RARE_ to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a _RARE_ military base
, one of the major reasons for the failure of the _RARE_ expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment
the pictures and stories of Soviet _RARE_ tanks on Cuban _RARE_ and Russian _RARE_ jet _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ has brought home to all of us the _RARE_ , _RARE_ truth of what it means to have a Russian military base _RARE_ miles away from home
and planes in Cuba _RARE_ the security of the United States , _RARE_ the Monroe Doctrine , and _RARE_ the security of every other Latin American _RARE_
full extent of this Russian military _RARE_ of Cuba was clear , President _RARE_ announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone
Latin American _RARE_ who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also _RARE_ swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the _RARE_ Defense Board
the United States had been trying to get these countries to _RARE_ _RARE_ representative from secret military _RARE_
took the pictures of the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ tanks to do the job
a new atmosphere of _RARE_ in Washington this week
see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President _RARE_ has made to _RARE_ solid _RARE_ support for his actions toward both Cuba and _RARE_ ; ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past
next move will be only time , of course , will tell
I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba
can't _RARE_ further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba
we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk
blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet _RARE_ of our hemisphere ''
from _RARE_ News & World Report , May 8 , 1961 ) next for Cuba : an arms blockade
Castro now -- _RARE_ than ever with arms and agents to _RARE_ the _RARE_
the United States act
one answer offered by experts
they see a way to _RARE_ Cuba , stop _RARE_ , maybe finish Castro , too
the question now facing President _RARE_ : How to put a stop to the Soviet _RARE_ in Cuba and to Communist _RARE_ of this hemisphere
25 , the White House reported that a total _RARE_ of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered
: To _RARE_ further _RARE_ economy

-- _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- was also _RARE_ notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro
in the view of military and civilian experts , could _RARE_ teeth to the Monroe Doctrine
_RARE_ a _RARE_ of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro
stop Cuban _RARE_ of guns and _RARE_ materials to South America
be the most severe _RARE_ , short of declared war , that the United States could _RARE_ against Castro
the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , _RARE_ of Congress , officers in the _RARE_
possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions
questions : what would a Cuba blockade take
say a tight naval blockade off Cuban _RARE_ and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft _RARE_ with a complement of about 100 planes and several _RARE_
, on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ , increasing to four the number of attack _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of Cuba
_RARE_ other big Navy ships are no less than a day's _RARE_ time away
out the _RARE_ force , submarines would be needed -- to locate , identify and track approaching vessels
would help with this task
radar _RARE_ ships
of Navy _RARE_ and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the _RARE_ task forces
go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; ; the _RARE_ force must be powerful enough to _RARE_ it ; ; and it must be enforced without discrimination
conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk
can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- _RARE_ and held , at least temporarily
be sent to U.S. _RARE_ for _RARE_ whether _RARE_ should be _RARE_
a blockade accomplish
say the experts
broad sense , it would _RARE_ the Monroe Doctrine by _RARE_ Communist interference in the Western _RARE_
, by avoiding direct intervention , provide a _RARE_ strategy to meet _RARE_ _RARE_
would be shipments of tanks , guns , _RARE_ _RARE_ and ammunition coming from Russia and _RARE_
arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as _RARE_
total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , textiles , and even _RARE_
, three ships a day from the Soviet _RARE_ are _RARE_ in Cuban _RARE_
_RARE_ in _RARE_ with the passage of Public Law _RARE_ , _RARE_ Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of _RARE_ , to return _RARE_ men and women to productive , _RARE_ employment
for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in _RARE_
this time and for the next eight years , the services provided _RARE_ persons consisted mainly of training , _RARE_ , and placement on a job
limitations of such a program , the _RARE_ Congress in _RARE_ passed P. L. _RARE_ , which _RARE_ the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical _RARE_ services to remove or reduce _RARE_ , and which revised the financing structure

successful rehabilitation of over a half million _RARE_ persons in the first eleven years after _RARE_ , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to _RARE_ with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of an estimated two million _RARE_
the States , therefore , in _RARE_ _RARE_ individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in _RARE_ employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the _RARE_ Congress enacted the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of 1954 ( P. L. _RARE_ )
to the _RARE_ _RARE_ Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more _RARE_ and `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the _RARE_ and the blind ) , and for other administrative _RARE_ to increase the _RARE_ overall effectiveness

law as it existed until _RARE_ , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a _RARE_ basis
L. _RARE_ , _RARE_ Congress , the Federal Government assumed responsibility for _RARE_ of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the _RARE_ and placement of the _RARE_ , and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing _RARE_ with rehabilitation case services
years , the statutory _RARE_ was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act
_RARE_ completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a _RARE_ grant structure -- for ( 1 ) basic support ; ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; ; and ( 3 ) research , _RARE_ , training and _RARE_ for vocational rehabilitation -- and in addition for short-term training and instruction
part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section
on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure
table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , _RARE_ , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program : method of _RARE_ funds description of formula
to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income
further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State
, in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of _RARE_ the `` ceiling '' , and not used for _RARE_ the `` floor '' , be _RARE_ to those States still below their _RARE_
are designed to reflect the differences in _RARE_ and population among the States , with the objective that a _RARE_ _RARE_ person have access to needed services regardless of whether he _RARE_ in a State with a low or high per capita income or a _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ State
are also designed to avoid _RARE_ in State programs already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of _RARE_ and population alone
computing allotments
used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act
`` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia , and _RARE_ the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii
steps are employed in calculations : 1
State ( except Puerto Rico , Guam , the Virgin Islands , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) determine average per capita income based on the last three years
_RARE_ of Data , below for per capita income data to be used in this step

average per capita income for the U. S. based on the last three years
_RARE_ of Data , below , for per capita income data to be used in this step

ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U. S. ( _RARE_ 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above

each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U. S.
the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above

particular State's `` allotment percentage ''
this is _RARE_ for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico
and Hawaii had fixed allotment _RARE_ in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
all other States it is the difference obtained by _RARE_ from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than _RARE_ nor more than _RARE_
resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these _RARE_ , the State's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme

State's allotment percentage

State's population
_RARE_ of Data , below for population data to be used in this step

population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage
result obtained in item 7 above , by result obtained in item 6 above

sum of the products obtained in item 8 above , for all the States
each State , make all _RARE_ set forth in items 1 to 8 above , and then add the results obtained for each State in item 8

ratio that the amount being _RARE_ is to the sum of the products for all the States
the amount being _RARE_ by the result obtained in item 9 above

particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year
the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above

the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is greater than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment
State's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year , which _RARE_ its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and _RARE_ times the percentage by which the sum being _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , must be reduced by the amount of the excess

the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment
its unadjusted allotment , each State is _RARE_ by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of _RARE_ which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to _RARE_

_RARE_ by _RARE_ in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; ; and second , to increase _RARE_ the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their _RARE_ , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby _RARE_ its maximum
on allotments
States which maintain two separate agencies -- one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind -- the Act _RARE_ that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954
in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine
explanation of matching formula
the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula
1960 , in order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds
and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ State ( or _RARE_ Federal ) participation in total program costs
of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State's `` Federal share ''
of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the State's `` unadjusted Federal share ''
1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) _RARE_ a year , so that by _RARE_ the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a _RARE_ _RARE_ State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and _RARE_ , respectively
rate of Federal participation with respect to any State's base allotment , as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is _RARE_ by the statute as that State's `` adjusted Federal _RARE_ ''
for determining a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States
of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent _RARE_ from abrupt changes in matching rates
computing Federal shares
used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the Act
`` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia and _RARE_ the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii
steps are employed in the calculations : 1
State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , determine the average per capita income for the last three years
same amount used in item 1 under _RARE_ Of _RARE_ _RARE_ , above

average per capita income for the United States for the last three years
same amount used in item 2 under _RARE_ Of _RARE_ _RARE_ , above

ratio of _RARE_ to the average per capita income of the United States
40 by the amount used in item 2 above

each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , that percentage which bears the same _RARE_ to _RARE_ as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the United States
the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above

particular State's `` Federal _RARE_ ''
this is _RARE_ for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico
and Hawaii had fixed Federal share _RARE_ in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
all other States it is the difference obtained by _RARE_ from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; except that no State shall have a Federal share less than 50% nor more than _RARE_
resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these _RARE_ , the State's Federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme
entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall
_RARE_ space is filled by _RARE_ blocks on edge
_RARE_ between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall
poured between this _RARE_ and the _RARE_ blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation _RARE_
details see _RARE_ , fig. 5
first one or two roof boards ( marked `` E '' in fig. 6 ) are slipped into place across the roof beams , from outside the shelter
are _RARE_ to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams , from inside the shelter
are passed between the beams and put on the boards
blocks are in two layers and are not _RARE_ together
the roof continues in this way
roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter
roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are _RARE_ into position
is complete
fig. 7
plans are on page 21
blocks , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter
are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit
are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection
an alternative
are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the _RARE_ solid concrete blocks
in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall
instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and _RARE_

shelter An _RARE_ , _RARE_ fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks
fig. 9 , _RARE_ shelter
people would have to hire a _RARE_ to build this shelter
on pages 22 and 23
could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface , making it _RARE_ to build an underground shelter
of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart
between them is filled with _RARE_ gravel or earth
are held together with metal _RARE_ placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built
shown here ( fig. 9 ) is a _RARE_ slab of _RARE_ concrete , covered with at least 20 inches of _RARE_ gravel
roof , perhaps more within _RARE_ reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , _RARE_ with boards and _RARE_
have to be covered with at least 28 inches of _RARE_ gravel
for a _RARE_ shelter would cost about _RARE_
would be additional
would provide almost absolute fallout protection
shelter _RARE_ _RARE_ metal sections or _RARE_ concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground
particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface
effective fallout shelters when _RARE_ over with earth , as shown in figure 10
this shelter would cost about _RARE_
probably would be required to help build it
would be added to the cost of materials
, as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation
_RARE_ entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials _RARE_ to _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ Association , Washington , D. C. , is developing plans to _RARE_ specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction
Clay Products Institute , Washington , D.C. , is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction
shelter An underground _RARE_ concrete shelter can be built by a _RARE_ for about $1,000 to _RARE_ , depending on the type of entrance
shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection
( fig. 11 ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and _RARE_ over
shelter could be built into an _RARE_ or below ground level
the shelter , with either a _RARE_ or _RARE_ entrance , are shown on pages 26 and _RARE_
of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction
add about _RARE_ to the total cost of the home
illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D.C. area in the Spring of 1959
common to each type of shelter are : 1
the entrance






must have at least one _RARE_ turn
somewhat like light
go around a corner
continues in a straight line
sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter
provided in a concrete block basement shelter by _RARE_ in the wall and by the open entrance
may be installed to increase comfort
is essential for the _RARE_ shelter and for the underground shelters
provide not less than 5 _RARE_ feet per minute of air per person
also are necessary ( as shown in figs. 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but _RARE_ are not
is cut down by the _RARE_ necessary to keep out radiation
as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made
will be necessary to _RARE_ an outside antenna , particularly to receive _RARE_ _RARE_
an important consideration
lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to which is _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ bulb
shown that such a device , with a fresh _RARE_ , will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days
spare _RARE_ , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured
or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a _RARE_ light is needed
be a regular electrical _RARE_ in the shelter as power may continue in many areas

there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be _RARE_ as shown in the Appendix , page 29
windows should be blocked when an emergency _RARE_
that project above the ground should be _RARE_ as shown in the Appendix , page 29
shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide
or materials to build them , may have to be put inside the _RARE_ before the shelter walls are completed
or _RARE_ shelters also will serve for _RARE_ or _RARE_ protection

a shelter The _RARE_ of fallout _RARE_ rapidly at first
after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion
radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous
civil defense instructions received over _RARE_ or by other means should be followed
radio is essential
suitable for home use are available , and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation
a possibility that _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ radiation _RARE_ may become available
thus would serve both purposes
civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources
tell you as soon as possible : How long to stay in your shelter ; ; How soon you may go _RARE_ ; ; How long you may stay outside
be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer
in the Appendix ( ( page 30 ) tells what is needed
children will have particular problems
provide for simple recreation
be a task for everyone and these tasks should be _RARE_
the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake
the _RARE_ it may be necessary to _RARE_ tasks that will keep the family busy
as _RARE_ can be kept
of the family will depend largely on information received by radio
should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast
probably will be necessary
be operated _RARE_ on a regular schedule
come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has _RARE_ enough to allow use of the whole basement
as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum
problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied
medical supplies , _RARE_ , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it
family has settled in the shelter , the _RARE_ rules should be _RARE_ out by the adult in charge
the _RARE_ of the family shelter will require much thought and planning
emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human _RARE_ will be an unfamiliar problem
container such as a kitchen _RARE_ _RARE_ might do as a toilet
_RARE_ can , with a tightly fitting cover , could be used to keep the _RARE_ until it is safe to leave the shelter
will be difficult and should be planned carefully
electric heater is _RARE_ for shelters in cold _RARE_
take the chill from the shelter in the beginning
the electric power fails after an attack , any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable
in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature
and _RARE_ , of course , are essential
or cooking should be avoided
would use up air
already have held weekend _RARE_ in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need

attack finds you without a prepared shelter Few areas , if any , are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about
dwelling without a basement provides some natural _RARE_ from fallout radiation
ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside
protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house
basement can cut the fallout radiation to _RARE_ of the outside level
place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and _RARE_ below ground
is time after the warning , the basement _RARE_ could be improved substantially by _RARE_ windows with _RARE_ , dirt , books , magazines , or other heavy material

apartment buildings _RARE_ apartment buildings of _RARE_ or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family _RARE_
, such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space
area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building , with concrete floors , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling
of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling
Government is _RARE_ local governments in several places to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many people
for the city apartment _RARE_ is primarily to plan the use of existing space
will require the cooperation of other _RARE_ and of the apartment management
Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about _RARE_ Du Pont's share of the General Motors market
communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were _RARE_ promoted
few years various Du Pont _RARE_ items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General _RARE_ eight operating divisions
_RARE_ division , long controlled by the _RARE_ brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions
to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend _RARE_ `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors _RARE_ Du Pont's capacity
fact that sticks out in this _RARE_ record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest
is _RARE_ that Du Pont's _RARE_ position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit ''
S. , at _RARE_
agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not _RARE_ by either Du Pont or General Motors ''
S. , at _RARE_
it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive _RARE_ in both companies acted _RARE_ and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to _RARE_ anyone , including Du Pont's _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ the Government's claim for relief
, as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the _RARE_ Act
provisions _RARE_ any contract , combination , or _RARE_ in _RARE_ of _RARE_ or foreign trade , and _RARE_ of , or attempts , combinations , or _RARE_ to _RARE_ , such trade
this Court put to one side without consideration the Government's appeal from the _RARE_ of its _RARE_ Act _RARE_
its decision solely on 7 , which _RARE_ in pertinent part : `` No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially _RARE_ competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to _RARE_ such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a _RARE_ of any line of commerce
shall not apply to corporations _RARE_ such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial _RARE_ of competition
purpose of this provision was thus explained in the _RARE_ opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its _RARE_ not only the substantial _RARE_ of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a _RARE_ corporation , but also to arrest in their _RARE_ restraints or _RARE_ in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation
is _RARE_ whether or not actual restraints or _RARE_ , or the substantial _RARE_ of competition , have occurred or are intended
U. S. , at _RARE_
a finding of _RARE_ to _RARE_ trade or attempt to _RARE_ was _RARE_ from the _RARE_ decision
as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the _RARE_ involved in the _RARE_ between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` _RARE_ and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies
however , did not bar finding that Du Pont had become _RARE_ as a _RARE_ of _RARE_ fabrics and _RARE_ to General Motors ; ; that these products _RARE_ a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton Act ; ; that General _RARE_ share of the market for these products was substantial ; ; and that competition for this share of the market was _RARE_ by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of _RARE_ free competition is obviously _RARE_ when no _RARE_ has an advantage over his _RARE_ from an acquisition of his _RARE_ stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute
, that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints
upon this record is _RARE_ that such _RARE_ was proved as to this acquisition
U. S. , at _RARE_
basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court _RARE_ the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief
guidance given the Court for _RARE_ the task committed to it was this : `` The judgment must therefore be _RARE_ and the cause _RARE_ to the District Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition _RARE_ to the statute
_RARE_ , in the _RARE_ of equitable _RARE_ , are _RARE_ ' with large discretion to model their _RARE_ to fit the _RARE_ of the particular case
Co. v. United States , _RARE_ U. S. _RARE_ , _RARE_ ''
S. , at _RARE_
us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court

judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 , 1957
_RARE_ conference -- held to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent _RARE_ -- took place on September 25 , 1957
_RARE_ , the Government's _RARE_ explained that _RARE_ for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to _RARE_ at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court
, he said , had proposed _RARE_ of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the Du Pont - General Motors relationship
, _RARE_ these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include _RARE_ of Du Pont's shares of General Motors
the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before _RARE_ a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if _RARE_ for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be _RARE_ , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days
Du Pont indicated a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of detailed plans by both sides at an early date
_RARE_ case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief
of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of _RARE_ or _RARE_ in the abstract
adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out
submitted its proposed _RARE_ on October 25 , 1957
called for _RARE_ by Du Pont of its _RARE_ shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a _RARE_ , over a period of ten years
Company and Delaware _RARE_ & _RARE_ Company , major stockholders in Du Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a _RARE_ period , of Du Pont's General Motors stock _RARE_ to them , as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned _RARE_
in the _RARE_ judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not _RARE_ during any given year , he was to be allowed to _RARE_ the court for an extension of time within the _RARE_ period
, the right to vote the General Motors stock held by Du Pont was to be _RARE_ in Du Pont's stockholders , other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; ; Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be _RARE_ from acquiring stock in or _RARE_ control over General Motors ; ; Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be _RARE_ to have any director or officer in common with General Motors , and vice _RARE_ ; ; and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont _RARE_ product , or for the grant of exclusive _RARE_ rights , or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a _RARE_ right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies
of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the court directed that a _RARE_ be obtained from the _RARE_ of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government's plan
9 , 1958 , the _RARE_ announced his _RARE_
dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be _RARE_ as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont's earnings and profits
, for federal income tax purposes , of the _RARE_ to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution
case of _RARE_ corporate stockholders , the measure would be the _RARE_ of the fair market value of the shares or Du Pont's tax basis for them , which is approximately _RARE_ per share
sale of the General Motors stock owned by or _RARE_ to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital _RARE_ rate
_RARE_ was filed on May 14 , 1958
plan Du Pont would _RARE_ its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares
Delaware would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares _RARE_ to them to their own stockholders
would be _RARE_ from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of Du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval
would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General _RARE_ distributions of stock or _RARE_ rights to its stockholders
6 , 1958 , General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal
, _RARE_ _RARE_ , that a _RARE_ order would severely _RARE_ the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont , with consequent serious loss and _RARE_ to hundreds of thousands of innocent _RARE_ , among them thousands of small _RARE_ and _RARE_ institutions ; ; that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other _RARE_ and chemical _RARE_ , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; ; that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would _RARE_ the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise _RARE_ capital ; ; and that all this would have a serious _RARE_ effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity
_RARE_ _RARE_ that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the _RARE_ of this Court
proposed by the _RARE_ _RARE_ were filed in August of 1958
, like Du Pont's , contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and _RARE_ of the three companies , their _RARE_ , and other people living in their _RARE_ , as well as other specified persons , were to be totally _RARE_
also _RARE_ common _RARE_ , officers , or employees between Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on the one hand , and General Motors on the other
not a medieval mental _RARE_ or an attitude `` _RARE_ by sense '' to believe that _RARE_ and _RARE_ should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the marriage relationship
is easy enough to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ Of The _RARE_ from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` _RARE_ '' of a married couple may reflect an _RARE_ belief that the _RARE_ between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage
_RARE_ in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has _RARE_ to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path _RARE_ by the recent decision in _RARE_ v. United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be _RARE_ to _RARE_ against her husband over her objection
not _RARE_ in his belief in _RARE_ law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must _RARE_ itself
these is the solidarity and the _RARE_ relationship of marriage
opinion _RARE_ _RARE_ that the _RARE_ _RARE_ doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` _RARE_ an _RARE_ into a rule of law ''
not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed
any event , I submit that the power to _RARE_ _RARE_ to Congress , not to this Court

who claims to be a _RARE_ _RARE_ , was _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Military Training and Service Act by _RARE_ to be _RARE_ into the armed forces
that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth _RARE_ , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice , he was not permitted to _RARE_ statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of _RARE_ as to his claim
On the record in this case , the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully _RARE_ with ; ; petitioner was not denied due process ; ; and his conviction is sustained

) Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to _RARE_ it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board

) Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's notes and report , especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of _RARE_ recommendation to the appeal board

) Petitioner was not entitled , either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of _RARE_ , since he was furnished a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and showed no particular need for the original report

_RARE_ argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner
_RARE_ argued the cause for the United States

S. _RARE_
concluded that _RARE_ claims are controlled by the _RARE_ of Gonzales v. United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ ( 1955 ) , and United States v. _RARE_ , _RARE_ U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore _RARE_ the judgment
with Local Board No. 9 , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , on March 17 , 1952
to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of _RARE_ _RARE_ , employed at night by a sugar _RARE_
_RARE_ classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching
13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class _RARE_
22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , _RARE_ this classification
stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other _RARE_ duties , and that he opposed war in any form
was classified _RARE_
1 , 1953 , after some six months of _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board
_RARE_ review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , _RARE_ him _RARE_ and _RARE_ this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his _RARE_ to kill in defense of his church and home
approval of the _RARE_ , he was ordered to report for _RARE_ on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so
not _RARE_ , however , and his case was subsequently _RARE_ , in the light of _RARE_ v. United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ ( 1955 )
again _RARE_ _RARE_ by the local board
a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared
report to the Attorney General , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be _RARE_ only from _RARE_ training and service
21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the _RARE_ classification
for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its _RARE_ in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the _RARE_ _RARE_ reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had _RARE_ both his _RARE_ and Bible Student _RARE_ positions
that he now devoted only some _RARE_ hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities
was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his _RARE_ and , consequently , upon his _RARE_ and good faith ''
board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation
answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and _RARE_ that his only claim to `` _RARE_ '' was in 1952
board , however , _RARE_ _RARE_ in the Department's recommendation
of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for _RARE_ and this _RARE_ followed his failure to do so
_RARE_ that the Department denied him _RARE_ due process by not giving him _RARE_ opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching
statement of the local board _RARE_ this claim to petitioner was in his file
that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have _RARE_ it before the hearing officer
failed to do , _RARE_ that he did not know it to be in his file
never took the trouble to find out
had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board
recommendation of the Department is _RARE_ to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a _RARE_ to lodge his denial
did
in Gonzales v. United States , _RARE_ , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a _RARE_
there that it was necessary `` that a _RARE_ be given an opportunity to _RARE_ ( the Department's ) recommendation when it comes to the _RARE_ Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification ''
, at _RARE_
to see how such procedure resulted in any _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it
said in Gonzales , `` it is the _RARE_ Board which _RARE_ the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be _RARE_ unless there is no basis in fact
United States , _RARE_ U.S. _RARE_ ''
S. , at _RARE_
are other _RARE_ which might be considered more difficult
trial , petitioner sought to secure through _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ notes of the Department's hearing officer , _RARE_ , as well as his report _RARE_
claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of _RARE_ reports to the Department of Justice
no specific _RARE_ errors or evidence _RARE_ ; ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of _RARE_ reports might _RARE_
of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a _RARE_ file
United States , _RARE_
is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the _RARE_
regulations _RARE_ required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the _RARE_ file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952
the hearing officer's report is but _RARE_ , is directed to the Attorney General and , of course , is not the recommendation of the Department
not essentially different from a _RARE_ of an attorney in the Department of Justice , of which the Attorney General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or _RARE_
but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board
also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board
petitioner had full opportunity to _RARE_ the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board
that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file
every opportunity to _RARE_ the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not _RARE_
to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial
, petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes
are now _RARE_ of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process
his testimony at trial never developed any such facts
light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation , which petitioner _RARE_ but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no _RARE_ in the hearing officer's report and notes
says that he was entitled to inspect the _RARE_ report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial
receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its _RARE_
no such claim is _RARE_
his present _RARE_ on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume
is fully answered by United States v. _RARE_ , _RARE_
held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to no _RARE_ that the _RARE_ reports must be produced for their inspection ''
, at _RARE_
we were not bound by _RARE_ , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report
of the Department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file , not on an _RARE_ report
in its total context With this _RARE_ role in mind , I should like to make a few suggestions : What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world
this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context
regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been _RARE_
is the total _RARE_ of the American people with peoples and governments abroad
that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation
the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a _RARE_ concern of the Department of Defense
also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , _RARE_ , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce
no longer rely on _RARE_ machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to _RARE_ differences between this and other departments
of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies
be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy
we need to concern ourselves also with the _RARE_ of action
officer cannot help but be a planning officer
keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present
of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to _RARE_ into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present
is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs
today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control
of course be times for delay and _RARE_
am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so _RARE_ and not through _RARE_ or through _RARE_ or _RARE_ difficulties
hope that we can do something about reducing the _RARE_ _RARE_ rate of ideas -- an _RARE_ of all _RARE_
to _RARE_ ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department
to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome , that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top
no one _RARE_ that only Presidential _RARE_ are looked upon as sources of ideas
for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank
I would hope that we could pay attention to little things
the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort
only a few examples : The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; ; the attitudes of a _RARE_ _RARE_ who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City , or of a foreign _RARE_ in similar circumstances in our _RARE_ , can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for
seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world
who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them
hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them
Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington , it follows that the _RARE_ is expected to take charge overseas
not mean in a purely _RARE_ sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion
expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are _RARE_ in his country
expected to _RARE_ , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can
official operation abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the _RARE_ to find out why and to get suggestions for _RARE_ action
of a policy officer It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed _RARE_ in recent years , in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain _RARE_ for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government
to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior _RARE_ policy officer faces
practically everybody in this room
will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine
policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of _RARE_ : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a _RARE_ , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American _RARE_ abroad , the filing of an item for the _RARE_ of the United Nations or of any other of _RARE_ of international bodies , a news item read at the breakfast table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference , a speech by a Senator or _RARE_ , an article in a _RARE_ , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et _RARE_ , ad _RARE_
officer lives with his _RARE_ _RARE_ for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility
thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign policy , and , if so , what is it
knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is _RARE_ frequently shapes the answer
over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he _RARE_ it further and because , if no _RARE_ answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered
has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history
_RARE_ of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which _RARE_ their frequently _RARE_ conclusions
that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it
already beginning to box the _RARE_ of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing
that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a _RARE_ fog
takes his _RARE_ from the great _RARE_ of policy , _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of the United States under international _RARE_ and _RARE_ , basic _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers _RARE_ in the Department
not be surprised to find that general principles produce _RARE_ results in the _RARE_ situation with which he is confronted
think about which of these principles must take _RARE_
know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance
aware that every _RARE_ important problem _RARE_ _RARE_ into every other problem
deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to _RARE_
think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer
be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government
_RARE_ could provide helpful advice
interests sufficiently involved to be consulted
the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved
at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted
is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem
of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an _RARE_ _RARE_ of the problem itself
President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required
action be _RARE_ or _RARE_
matter one for the United Nations or some other international body
if so , the path leads through a complex process of _RARE_ _RARE_ which _RARE_ still another dimension to the problem
the opinions of mankind What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad
policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it
interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public _RARE_ about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind
given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support
add a caution on this particular point
not want policy officers below the level of Presidential _RARE_ to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in _RARE_ foreign policy action
first place our business is foreign policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his _RARE_ in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem
emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department of State don't know much about domestic politics ''
an important consideration
sit here reading _RARE_ and looking at _RARE_ _RARE_ and other reports that cross our _RARE_ , we should realize that this is raw , _RARE_ opinion expressed in the absence of leadership
American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership
test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action
, for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the _RARE_ plan , any _RARE_ expert would have said that the country would have accepted such _RARE_
in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a _RARE_ of utterly complicated factors -- political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , _RARE_ , administrative -- to be _RARE_ out and handled within a political system which moves by _RARE_ in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control
policy officer has the _RARE_ of time snapping at his heels
should be no general age limit or _RARE_ to one sex , there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women
Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for _RARE_ Peace Corps work on the same project
be no draft _RARE_ because of Peace Corps service
cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary _RARE_
volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States
it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their _RARE_ abroad are paid
principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services
principle should be _RARE_ to that of the allowance
volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living
live in modest circumstances , avoiding all _RARE_ consumption
they should live with their host country _RARE_
health requirements might have to be met
, it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers
Public _RARE_ Service , State Department and Armed _RARE_ medical facilities can be utilized
to the U.S. , volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service , based on the length of time served

part of the government should the Peace Corps be established
of a Peace Corps has _RARE_ the imagination of a great many people
it cuts across party , regional , _RARE_ and other lines
Corps , therefore , offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think _RARE_ and start _RARE_ in their participation in world development
, the Peace Corps should be administered by a small , new , alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation
reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program , the Peace Corps should be established as an agency in the Department of State
aid operations are _RARE_ the Peace Corps should remain a _RARE_ , functional unit
the Peace Corps could be _RARE_ located in _RARE_ facilities and depend on the State Department and _RARE_ for administrative support and , when needed , program assistance
way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations

when should the Peace Corps be launched
Corps can either begin in very low gear , with only _RARE_ work undertaken between now and when Congress finally _RARE_ special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action , with sufficient funds and made available from existing _RARE_ Security _RARE_ to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer
Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to _RARE_ the most qualified people from this year's _RARE_ classes will not be lost
we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university _RARE_
in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks , the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall
year or two several thousand might be in service
then grow steadily as it _RARE_ itself and as the need for it is demonstrated

the first projects be
first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects
here is most clearly felt and our capacity to _RARE_ and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest
, however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of _RARE_ _RARE_ to existing development projects
year's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia

the Peace Corps be received abroad
need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation , the readiness to receive such manpower , or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country
_RARE_ about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters
groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active _RARE_
are _RARE_ that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends
important , however , that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community
it to other governments and to the United Nations , we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace _RARE_ and that the United Nations _RARE_ the idea and form an international _RARE_ committee
hope that peace _RARE_ projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands
case , our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as _RARE_ _RARE_ in development projects of the _RARE_ and other international agencies
Corps is not a _RARE_ or _RARE_ venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership
must be to learn as much as we teach
Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower
in this spirit , the response and the results will be _RARE_ better

it be financed
appropriated funds within the discretion of the President and Secretary of State under the _RARE_ Security Act are the only immediately available source of financing this _RARE_ pilot programs of the Peace Corps
is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds , in order to carry out the purposes of the _RARE_ Security Act through this new peaceful program , this will be a hopeful sign to the world
then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year
Congress should consider _RARE_ the Peace Corps to receive _RARE_ from American businesses , unions , civic organizations and the public at large
must be the project of the whole American people
Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a _RARE_ point for public understanding
also be taken to link the _RARE_ for Peace Program with the Peace Corps , so that foreign _RARE_ _RARE_ by the sale of U.S. surplus food under _RARE_ _RARE_ can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel
to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies , universities , international organizations , and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully _RARE_

worth the cost and the _RARE_
how well conceived and efficiently run , there probably will be _RARE_
be _RARE_ and have a serious effect both at home and abroad
the popular response suggests , the _RARE_ of the Peace Corps is very great
contribute to the development of critical countries and regions
promote international cooperation and good will toward this country
also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world
of young Americans going to work in developing areas , millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before
and universities carrying a large part of the program , and with students looking toward Peace Corps service , there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student _RARE_
home , the _RARE_ later given by returning members of the Peace Corps , the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may _RARE_ to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world
is meeting the world's need , too , since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world
Corps thus can add a new dimension to _RARE_ world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting
said in your State of the Union message , `` The problems are towering and _RARE_ -- and the response must be towering and _RARE_ as well ''
Congress of the United States : I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower
today signed an _RARE_ Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis
Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in _RARE_ more effective plans for a permanent organization
, by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall
Peace Corps is being established under existing authority in the _RARE_ Security Act and will be located in the Department of State
expenses will be paid from _RARE_ currently available for our foreign aid program
world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which _RARE_ their _RARE_ desires
freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , _RARE_ from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and poverty
the greatest _RARE_ to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to _RARE_ with the demands of swiftly _RARE_ _RARE_ , and with the _RARE_ to put that capacity to work in the _RARE_ , the mountains , the towns and the factories of _RARE_ of struggling nations
task of economic development _RARE_ requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools , construct development projects , demonstrate modern methods of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge
this urgent need for skilled manpower we are _RARE_ the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will _RARE_ and train American volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations
will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical _RARE_ by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work
help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments , acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice
little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them
resources In 1960 _RARE_ of the _RARE_ million recreation visits to the National Forests and _RARE_ were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing
_RARE_ visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the _RARE_ sale of hunting and fishing _RARE_
is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by _RARE_
objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game _RARE_ to contribute to the need for public use and _RARE_
habitat management _RARE_ for the _RARE_ period are : 1
complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , _RARE_ proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources

evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and _RARE_ are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including ( A ) _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ habitat surveys and investigations on the _RARE_ million acres of National Forests and _RARE_ , ( B ) _RARE_ habitat surveys and investigations on the _RARE_ miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and ( C ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States , other Federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in _RARE_ with other _RARE_ values

and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas

_RARE_ , food patches , and game ways in dense _RARE_ by clearing or controlled burning on _RARE_ acres

miles of fishing streams and _RARE_ acres of _RARE_ by _RARE_ banks , _RARE_ _RARE_ cover , and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
total _RARE_ impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized
and destroy , _RARE_ or prevent _RARE_ and growth , _RARE_ and damage values , and _RARE_ uses
in growth of _RARE_ because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about _RARE_ billion board feet
were not for the effect of destructive agencies , _RARE_ growth would have been nearly twice as great as the _RARE_ billion board feet in 1952
percent of the loss in growth was _RARE_ to disease , 20 percent to insects , 17 percent to fire , and 18 percent to weather , animals , and various other causes
forces also have a seriously _RARE_ effect upon the _RARE_ and their _RARE_ _RARE_ , and upon the other _RARE_ forest resources
objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously _RARE_ with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and _RARE_ sustained yield of products and services
be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to _RARE_ with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of _RARE_ and disease _RARE_
to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease
insects and disease In the _RARE_ period , it is proposed that _RARE_ and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention , detection , and control of _RARE_ and disease _RARE_ that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large _RARE_ toward the end of the initial period
require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection
will consist of : 1
present activities through ( A ) _RARE_ , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; ( B ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial _RARE_ to cause widespread damage ; ; ( C ) _RARE_ and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a _RARE_ epidemic
_RARE_ activities would cover about twice the _RARE_ currently being treated

present _RARE_ _RARE_ control work plus extension of control to _RARE_ acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production
is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed

program to control _RARE_ _RARE_ on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young _RARE_ _RARE_ on better growing _RARE_

_RARE_ control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses
fire It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial _RARE_ , all critical _RARE_ , and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak _RARE_
include _RARE_ million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection
15 million acres will be given a _RARE_ degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation
levels of protection from fire calls for : 1
modernization , and development of fire control to a _RARE_ and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and _RARE_ fires before they spread beyond permitted standards
to be accomplished by nearly _RARE_ the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled _RARE_ _RARE_ , and equipment use
include a _RARE_ program of training and development of personnel

use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for _RARE_ of fires while small , and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely

_RARE_ fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to _RARE_ areas
will cover the most serious _RARE_ of all land _RARE_ such treatment , and will consist of burning _RARE_ acres of highly _RARE_ debris concentration , _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ acres of high _RARE_ areas , prescribed burning on _RARE_ million acres , _RARE_ _RARE_ fuel on _RARE_ acres , and clearing and maintaining _RARE_ miles of _RARE_
other damage _RARE_ control work for the _RARE_ period will be aimed at control of the most serious _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , such as _RARE_ and mice , on _RARE_ areas of _RARE_ and commercial _RARE_
comprise about half of the total area of _RARE_ _RARE_ on the National Forests
million acres of _RARE_ and _RARE_ million acres of _RARE_ would be treated in this period
be limited to those _RARE_ for which economical means of control are known
trails The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of _RARE_ and access roads and trails under various _RARE_ and _RARE_
is divided into a forest highway system , administered by the Secretary of Commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , administered by the Secretary of _RARE_
these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the National Forests
forest highway system , there are now _RARE_ miles of public roads
mostly through _RARE_ that carry traffic going from one destination to another
of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties , this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the _RARE_ to it that are needed
estimated that about _RARE_ miles of forest _RARE_ will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests
forest development road and trail system , there are now _RARE_ miles of roads and _RARE_ miles of _RARE_ foot and horse trails
are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests
maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of _RARE_
estimated that about _RARE_ miles of forest development roads , and _RARE_ miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum _RARE_ yield and use of the wood , water , _RARE_ , and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis
trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection
be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and _RARE_
or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as : ( A ) the protection of _RARE_ , timber , and wildlife resources from fire , insects , and disease ; ; ( B ) the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ; ( C ) the volume of timber that can be _RARE_ , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business _RARE_ ; ; ( D ) the level of _RARE_ cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly _RARE_ losses resulting from fire , _RARE_ , insects , and disease ; ; ( E ) the protection of _RARE_ lands from _RARE_ and _RARE_ by animals
of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible
roads that give access to National Forest timber are _RARE_ which pay their own way over a period of years
these roads by the public results in substantial _RARE_ to the _RARE_ the roads serve
objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services
year _RARE_ this means _RARE_ ( A ) the protection requirements of a _RARE_ producing at least 200 million _RARE_ of water each year , ( B ) recreation and wildlife resources used each year by _RARE_ million visitors , ( C ) a timber _RARE_ supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and ( D ) 60 million acres of _RARE_
these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about _RARE_ miles of new roads and _RARE_ miles of new trails , along with the _RARE_ to higher standards of about _RARE_ miles of roads and _RARE_ miles of trails
miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads
percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year _RARE_
for forest development roads and trails for the _RARE_ period _RARE_ are as follows : 1
construction and _RARE_ of about _RARE_ miles of _RARE_ roads and _RARE_ miles of trails
about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities
percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by _RARE_ of National Forest timber , but paid for by the Government through adjustment of _RARE_ prices

to full standards on the _RARE_ miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period
, land purchase , land use Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular
units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together
others , the previous _RARE_ of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership
boundaries of National Forests and National _RARE_ , there are about _RARE_ acres in _RARE_ ownership
is the occurrence of occasional _RARE_ because private owners of some _RARE_ object to public programs of use on _RARE_ National Forest or other Federal land , or because such _RARE_ are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of _RARE_ National Forest land
held _RARE_ are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands
, which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes , are _RARE_ or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ; there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be _RARE_ or changed
this last category are situated largely in the _RARE_ portions of the Eastern States
objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of _RARE_ which comprise key _RARE_ for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National _RARE_
_RARE_ of the U.S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest _RARE_ in history
of emphasis from _RARE_ to _RARE_ warfare must be made with care , _RARE_ that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other
forces must be capable of _RARE_ successfully with any _RARE_ which may be forced upon us , from limited _RARE_ to _RARE_ nuclear general war
military personnel strength
budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a _RARE_ strength of _RARE_ men and women in the active forces
to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and _RARE_ men ; ; a Navy of _RARE_ active ships and _RARE_ men ; ; a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with _RARE_ men ; ; and an Air Force of _RARE_ combat wings and _RARE_ men
reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must _RARE_ to the changing character and missions of the active forces
combat readiness must take _RARE_ over mere numbers
conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve
_RARE_ the Secretary of Defense to _RARE_ the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare
the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve
on the strength of the Army National _RARE_ contained in the 1960 Department of Defense _RARE_ Act should likewise be dropped
recommend to the Congress the _RARE_ of _RARE_ floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity
proposed a reduction in the Army National _RARE_ and Army Reserve -- from their present _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , respectively , to _RARE_ and _RARE_ by the end of the fiscal year 1961
are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the _RARE_ in support of our national security objectives
costs
_RARE_ of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel
are estimated to be _RARE_ billion , an increase of _RARE_ million over 1960 , reflecting additional _RARE_ pay of career personnel , more _RARE_ , an increased number of men drawing _RARE_ pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 )
costs are increased by _RARE_ million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel
costs are partially offset by a decrease of _RARE_ million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961
rates of pay for retired military personnel have been _RARE_ to current rates of pay for active personnel
military pay act _RARE_ from this established formula by providing for a _RARE_ increase rather than a _RARE_ increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958
pending legislation that will _RARE_ the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates
maintenance
for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be _RARE_ billion in 1961 , which is _RARE_ million more than in 1960
stems largely from the growing _RARE_ of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment
increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential
the program for _RARE_ modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures
arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year
increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up _RARE_ in two years , and of each _RARE_ hour , up _RARE_
, these increases in operating costs _RARE_ the _RARE_ that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and _RARE_ in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces
budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate _RARE_ of section _RARE_ of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ )
_RARE_ the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense _RARE_ from carrying out certain _RARE_ involving real property unless they come into agreement with the _RARE_ on Armed _RARE_ of the Senate and the House of _RARE_
have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section _RARE_ fundamental _RARE_ principles
if it is not _RARE_ by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to _RARE_ the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise
communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air Force , and Federal _RARE_ _RARE_
communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise
already been proposed to _RARE_ the sale of these _RARE_ systems in Alaska , and its early _RARE_ is desirable
research , and construction
_RARE_ of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs
, these expenditures are estimated at _RARE_ billion , compared to _RARE_ billion in 1960
, which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices
_RARE_ are estimated at about the same level as in 1960
authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) _RARE_ _RARE_ million , which is _RARE_ million below that enacted for 1960
other hand , the new authority of _RARE_ million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is _RARE_ million higher than for 1960
_RARE_ in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead
of Defense _RARE_ acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items
have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more _RARE_ than the general law , _RARE_ known as the _RARE_ American Act
once again that the Congress not _RARE_ this rider
of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without _RARE_ other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress
few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history
systems have become _RARE_ while still in production , and some while still under development
unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological _RARE_ on any one weapon system , in itself , often _RARE_ the relative importance of other competitive systems
necessitated a continuous review and _RARE_ of the defense program in order to _RARE_ resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been _RARE_ by events
in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was _RARE_ have since been completely eliminated
, the importance of the _RARE_ 2 , a very promising _RARE_ _RARE_ missile designed to be launched by _RARE_ submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced _RARE_ ballistic missile launched by _RARE_ submarines
is the recent _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , a long-range _RARE_ with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against _RARE_ bombers in the period of the _RARE_
progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from _RARE_ bombers to missiles
high cost of the _RARE_ system -- over _RARE_ billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project
other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message
and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans
this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and _RARE_ , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas _RARE_ ballistic missile
of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the _RARE_ fuel program
was started at a time when there was a critical need for a _RARE_ fuel to provide an extra _RARE_ of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers
problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant _RARE_ in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the _RARE_ fuel program
result , the scope of this project has been sharply _RARE_
_RARE_ the importance of even more searching _RARE_ of new major development programs and even more _RARE_ and _RARE_ analyses of the _RARE_ of future technology
of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to _RARE_ it

_RARE_ power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear _RARE_ capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war
capability is represented by a combination of _RARE_ bombers , _RARE_ aircraft , and _RARE_ and intermediate range missiles
capability is represented by our _RARE_ ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready _RARE_ capable of _RARE_ early emergency _RARE_
Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability
the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the _RARE_ , a long-range _RARE_ _RARE_
, which was planned for initial operational use about _RARE_ , would be _RARE_ to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier
Atlas _RARE_ are now operational , the first two _RARE_ submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first _RARE_ _RARE_ next year
_RARE_ _RARE_ is planned to be operational about _RARE_
, several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their _RARE_ established
the need for the _RARE_ as a strategic weapon system is doubtful
I am _RARE_ that development work on the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ be continued
expected that in _RARE_ two _RARE_ aircraft will be available for flight testing
time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system
_RARE_ additional _RARE_ of the improved _RARE_ of the _RARE_ ( the _RARE_ with the new _RARE_ engine ) and procurement of the _RARE_ _RARE_ medium _RARE_ , together with the supporting _RARE_ _RARE_ in each case
modern bombers will replace some of the older _RARE_ medium bombers ; ; one _RARE_ can do the work of several _RARE_ which it will replace
also included in this budget to continue the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ wings with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ missile
coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ missiles also will be _RARE_
will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities , including the classes , types _RARE_ _RARE_ of food grain , the time and circumstances of _RARE_ of the rupees accruing from such sale , and other relevant matters

States recognizes the desire of India to _RARE_ , as quickly as possible , a substantial part of the one million _RARE_ reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in _RARE_ the internal markets for this _RARE_ in India
Agreement the first annual review of rice _RARE_ will be made in August 1960
time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 , disposal , _RARE_ production , consumption and _RARE_ of food _RARE_ , other _RARE_ from the United States and countries friendly to the United States , _RARE_ storage capacity , and other related factors , any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice _RARE_ which is currently planned for procurement during the first year

Governments agree that the _RARE_ of purchase authorizations for _RARE_ and rice providing for purchase after June 30 , 1961 , shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 , of the Act at that time
States Government shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales under this Agreement of any _RARE_ if it determines at any time after June 30 , 1961 , that such action is necessitated by the existence of an international emergency

of India shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and services financed under the projects , and shall furnish to the United States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning the _RARE_ matters and the expenditures related thereto
_RARE_ leaves within our discretion ( subject to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided

proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_
or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each _RARE_ to some extent with reception of the other
of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be _RARE_ at any point where either of the stations _RARE_ a _RARE_ signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective _RARE_ power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day
playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the _RARE_ cycle , ground _RARE_ along the transmission path , _RARE_ and _RARE_ noise , and others
existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a _RARE_ basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances
such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g. , power and station _RARE_ ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation
of the overall standards applied is the _RARE_ ratio established for the determination of that degree of _RARE_ interference which is regarded as _RARE_
standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , _RARE_ interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station _RARE_ signal is of an intensity _RARE_ or more of the strength of station _RARE_ signal at that point

ratio for _RARE_ interference _RARE_ one of the fundamental _RARE_ principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and _RARE_ -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of _RARE_ interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service
fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies
a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the upper atmosphere known as the _RARE_
stations _RARE_ both skywave and groundwave signals , at all hours ; ; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave _RARE_ are not reflected in any substantial quantity , and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are , in general , negligible
nighttime hours the skywave _RARE_ are reflected from the _RARE_ , thereby creating the possibility of one _RARE_ rendering service , via skywave , at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal , and at the same time _RARE_ _RARE_ the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies
the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to _RARE_ different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime _RARE_ in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night

recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions , and vice _RARE_ , is not an _RARE_ process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise
period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions _RARE_ ; ; during the same period around sunrise , skywave transmission is declining , until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance
in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations , representing an averaging of conditions , and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the _RARE_ points between daytime and nighttime conditions
determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset , respectively , should be used for this purpose
the _RARE_ rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations
, stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset ( for daytime class 2 , stations ) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 , station where located west of the class 2 , station ( for _RARE_ class 2 , stations )
restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 , stations operating on regional channels , which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other
to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( figs. 1 and 2 of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the rules ) giving average skywave values
were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data
recognized that skywave signals , because of their reflected nature , are of great _RARE_ and subject to wide _RARE_ in strength
reason , the more uncertain skywave service was _RARE_ `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the _RARE_ , more reliable groundwave `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular _RARE_ level is _RARE_ -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference

, the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations
and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation
, as we have stated many times , are -- ( 1 ) To provide some service to all listeners ; ; ( 2 ) To provide as many _RARE_ of service to as many listeners as possible ; ; ( 3 ) To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible
frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent _RARE_ in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for _RARE_ achievement of the others
the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations
frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 , -- A or Class 1 , -- B _RARE_ stations , designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and ( at night ) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances , being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective
with these frequencies , the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was _RARE_ ; ; the other objectives were _RARE_ to it
1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to their _RARE_ groundwave contours against daytime _RARE_ interference
to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- A operation , and so render skywave service free from _RARE_ interference _RARE_ they may be received ; ; class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to their _RARE_ _RARE_ time skywave contours against _RARE_ interference
provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference , only class 1 , stations are capable of rendering skywave service
operation by stations of other classes of course _RARE_ skywave interference to groundwave service , interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it

to other frequencies , these are _RARE_ as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power
allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been _RARE_ to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible

, the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference
hours , because of the intense skywave propagation then _RARE_ , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it
under our _RARE_ allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- A ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- A station can render service , interference free , wherever it can be received
remainder of the clear channels , the dominant ( class 1 ) -- B stations are protected as described above , and the relatively small number of secondary ( class 2 ) ) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate _RARE_ _RARE_ with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 , stations
daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively _RARE_ , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels
2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local _RARE_ for a large number of communities
daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them
on the regional channels many class 3 , stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ lower power

the question presented for decision in the present _RARE_ _RARE_ proceeding is whether our decision ( in _RARE_ ) to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset , is sound as a basis for AM _RARE_ , or whether , in the light of later developments and new understanding , skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account , and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours
of the proceeding 10
reached in _RARE_ was made after the _RARE_ of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof
, there has been a _RARE_ increase in the number of stations and also the _RARE_ of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena
, _RARE_ were filed with the Commission by various _RARE_ stations _RARE_ that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the _RARE_ so as to create skywave _RARE_

or _RARE_ _RARE_ , of which there have been too many recently , may do more harm than good ; ; for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving _RARE_ in scholarship and the arts which are _RARE_ when the programs are discontinued ; ; and they are _RARE_ , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit
making of selections on the basis of _RARE_ requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a _RARE_ of _RARE_ whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time
group of the Foundation's _RARE_ are , at any one period of time , the members of our Advisory Board , consisting , now , of _RARE_ men and women
chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own _RARE_ _RARE_ in their different fields of scholarship and the arts
in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic _RARE_ also are factors in the _RARE_ minds
concept of an Advisory Board , _RARE_ to the Board of Trustees , we are _RARE_ to the late President of _RARE_ University , A. Lawrence _RARE_ , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration
had the wit and wisdom to _RARE_ Mr. _RARE_ concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been , it may be said truly , pretty _RARE_ good
in accordance with Mr. _RARE_ concept of an _RARE_ board , our selections are made by experienced _RARE_ who give both _RARE_ and consistency to our processes and our _RARE_
we should become too consistent , in the sense of becoming _RARE_ of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts , the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains a _RARE_ -- not a flow
new members through the Advisory Board
of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection -- one for the selection of _RARE_ from Canada , the United States , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ area and one for the selection of _RARE_ from the Latin American _RARE_ and the Republic of the _RARE_
members of our Advisory Board , and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection , the Foundation is _RARE_ for its successes of choice of _RARE_
, as we know , utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get ; ; and quality of advice , added to _RARE_ to the Foundation's purposes and _RARE_ , we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day
facts about our Advisory Board and its _RARE_ duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and _RARE_ , on which to base our selections of _RARE_
, the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , formally , members of that Board
besides , there are a large number of scholars , artists , _RARE_ of music , _RARE_ , poets , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and _RARE_ out of their experience
, the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks : to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of _RARE_ in words how grateful we are
a _RARE_ of business that no business can be better than its board of _RARE_ and its top management
is true of every foundation
_RARE_ reviewed in this Report , our Board of Trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the Board and to top management to insure future _RARE_ of the _RARE_ administration of the Foundation's affairs : Dr. James Brown _RARE_ , _RARE_ , President of the _RARE_ Telephone _RARE_ , was elected to the Board of Trustees
a member both of the National _RARE_ of _RARE_ and of the American _RARE_ Society ; ; and he has served our country well as a scientific _RARE_ on international _RARE_
N. _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and Professor of English in the University of Illinois , was appointed _RARE_ Secretary General
of the Foundation appointed Dr. _RARE_ to that position with the stated expectation that he would _RARE_ the present Secretary General upon the _RARE_ eventual _RARE_
is a _RARE_ of the Foundation -- appointed _RARE_ to assist his studies of William _RARE_ _RARE_ and of H. G. _RARE_ -- and , before his appointment to the Foundation's executive staff , had been given our highest _RARE_ _RARE_ , appointment to the Advisory Board
to the Foundation's officers , Dr. James F. _RARE_ , for eleven years our _RARE_ _RARE_ as _RARE_ Secretary , was promoted to be Secretary
a _RARE_ , with the great merit of a _RARE_ long view
to the Foundation's staff , as _RARE_ Secretary , is Mr. J. _RARE_ Smith , Jr.
, like the present Secretary General , is a lawyer ; ; and lawyers -- with the great _RARE_ that they are trained to read `` the fine print '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at _RARE_ solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are _RARE_ even in a foundation office
Secretary General has been the Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation's establishment _RARE_ years ago
he will not last _RARE_ and the _RARE_ new arrangements are , quite simply , made to assure _RARE_ _RARE_ in the Foundation's policies and practices
recognition of _RARE_ and its _RARE_ has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year
not given to _RARE_ , neither personally nor in these _RARE_
contrary , if this be an _RARE_ era as is commonly said , we see it as an era of opportunity
_RARE_ that there are great _RARE_ problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ; and by their _RARE_ tend to create resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth
, examples are _RARE_ : _RARE_ speaking his funeral _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ after _RARE_ and making it a _RARE_ of freedom ; ; _RARE_ writing the _RARE_ of Independence _RARE_ the _RARE_ of revolution ; ; Christ preaching the _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , close to his ultimate sacrifice ; ; _RARE_ speaking with `` the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ voice '' -- ; ; _RARE_ words -- in the days of the Spanish _RARE_ threats ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ , at the age of twenty-three , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ `` to two and fifty places '' during the great _RARE_ year in England , _RARE_ ; ; Winston _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of _RARE_ less than twenty years ago ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ of outer space , answering _RARE_ questions of science and philosophy , in the face of possible wars of _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , as the Roman poet , _RARE_ , declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today
, indeed , cause for _RARE_ to remember what many _RARE_ of the past produced ; ; and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind
, out of the social _RARE_ of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens ; ; and his genius moved his _RARE_ to seek solutions of those _RARE_ for all Western men -- until today -- , in the _RARE_ West , these social _RARE_ substantially do not exist
were not arrived at by any _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business
_RARE_ men , who , as Mr. Justice _RARE_ was fond of saying , formed their _RARE_ out of experience under the burden of responsibility
, to put it _RARE_ , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected
they made _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use _RARE_ word -- more than a _RARE_ wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the _RARE_ pockets with the result , in turn , that the _RARE_ between the rich and the poor would _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of the poor increase
all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ; indeed , the contrary has happened
between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has narrowed , in the _RARE_ Western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable
reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the _RARE_ of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity
say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ; and even putting it that way would not prove that _RARE_ was anything but wrong
_RARE_ _RARE_ , a hundred years before _RARE_ was a force to be _RARE_ with , wrote his brilliant legal _RARE_ , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract ''
of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do
the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice
the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ; the greater the range of choice , the greater the rate of change
is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future
there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress
truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart
anybody think that considerations such as these are not _RARE_ in a foundation report , let me _RARE_ them with the _RARE_ that , under _RARE_ there would have been no capital with which to _RARE_ the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the _RARE_ might _RARE_ , _RARE_ in every way , toward their _RARE_ , their creative efforts for the good of mankind
year 1959 , we granted _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; in 1960 , we granted _RARE_
, our _RARE_ are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts
not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all _RARE_ and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all _RARE_ scholarship and artistic creation does
if pressed , we would say what the late Robert _RARE_ , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that _RARE_ ''
we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the _RARE_ , the creative arts
no part in such discussions , because we think them largely _RARE_ ; ; and we think them largely _RARE_ because , for true _RARE_ of _RARE_ , every _RARE_ and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view
Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ Company reached its _RARE_ year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world
history standing _RARE_ all but the very _RARE_ of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular _RARE_ to the mechanical _RARE_ of its _RARE_ , Joseph R. Brown , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ for precision and progress in _RARE_ technology
Brown grew up in the _RARE_ and enterprise of New England between _RARE_ and _RARE_
early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and _RARE_ , as he _RARE_ his trade
age of 17 he became an _RARE_ _RARE_ at the shop of _RARE_ & Harris in Valley _RARE_ , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after _RARE_ , he went into business for himself in _RARE_ , making _RARE_ and small tools
led to a _RARE_ combination beginning in _RARE_ , under the name D. Brown & _RARE_ , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe
of _RARE_ partnership with his father were _RARE_
, a _RARE_ fire _RARE_ their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years
continued in business by himself , quickly _RARE_ the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a _RARE_ in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world
his genius , of course , sprang from his familiarity with clock movements
early years the repair of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and the building of special _RARE_ for church _RARE_ formed an important part of the young man's occupation
particularly interested in _RARE_ and precision measurement during the _RARE_ , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period
business also grew , and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to _RARE_ as much time to his creative thinking as his _RARE_ led him to desire
have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , _RARE_ , Joseph Brown made the _RARE_ entry in his job book , in his _RARE_ _RARE_ style , `` _RARE_ Sharpe came to work for me this day as an _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ apparently did well by Mr. Brown , for in the third year of his _RARE_ _RARE_ was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ; the company became `` J. R. Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development
arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most _RARE_ -- time for `` _RARE_ '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision _RARE_ which most interested him at that time
, the new partnership announced the precision _RARE_ _RARE_ as the first fruit of their joint efforts
significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in _RARE_ by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and _RARE_ engine
, in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant _RARE_ in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular _RARE_ , in index _RARE_ , and in many other fields where accuracy was a _RARE_ requirement
_RARE_ , both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical _RARE_
were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire _RARE_ system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today
development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the _RARE_ field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture
, the partnership began manufacturing the _RARE_ & Gibbs sewing machine
story goes , Mr. Gibbs , who _RARE_ came from the back counties of the _RARE_ of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous _RARE_ sewing machine
to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , _RARE_ the crude machine to take _RARE_
showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the _RARE_ sewing machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his amazement that the _RARE_ _RARE_ , which was unknown to him in detail , used two _RARE_ while the one that he had _RARE_ used only one
_RARE_ the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. _RARE_ decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company _RARE_ its manufacture
work was a _RARE_ to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment
screw machine , now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine , takes its _RARE_ directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to _RARE_ equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine
made important _RARE_ to the arts in screw machine design by _RARE_ _RARE_ the means for _RARE_ the _RARE_ , by _RARE_ automatic feeding devices for the stock , and _RARE_ tap and die _RARE_
, Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of _RARE_ _RARE_
time , during the Civil War , Union _RARE_ were being _RARE_ in Providence and the _RARE_ to _RARE_ them were being _RARE_ with _RARE_ files
neither satisfied the urgent production _RARE_ nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation
of this problem was Mr. Brown's famous _RARE_ No. 1 _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ from which is descended today's universal _RARE_ milling machine used throughout the world
machine , bearing its famous _RARE_ number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ Center in Providence
Civil War period Mr. Brown also _RARE_ the Brown & Sharpe formed _RARE_ gear _RARE_ , a basic invention which ultimately _RARE_ the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic _RARE_
that time it had been possible to make _RARE_ for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one _RARE_
as the time came for _RARE_ , the precise form of the gear _RARE_ was lost and a new _RARE_ had to be made
made the economical manufacture of _RARE_ _RARE_ until some way could be found to permit the repeated _RARE_ of gear _RARE_ _RARE_ without the loss of the precision form
invention achieved this and , as a _RARE_ , formed the _RARE_ of Brown & _RARE_ position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which _RARE_ until the _RARE_ when _RARE_ by other methods
_RARE_ , as a common workshop tool , also _RARE_ much to J. R. Brown
Brown was not himself its _RARE_ ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his _RARE_ first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use
was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in _RARE_ , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it _RARE_ its leadership to this day
achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine
was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made its appearance in _RARE_ at the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
, like its milling _RARE_ , was the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ used to this very day in precision _RARE_ shops throughout the world
J. R. Brown's other major developments , the universal grinding machine was _RARE_ _RARE_ in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come
Brown's death , there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company
man was Samuel Darling
of the firm Darling & _RARE_ , Mr. Darling began by _RARE_ Brown & Sharpe to its _RARE_ competition during the _RARE_ and early _RARE_
, however , a _RARE_ was called between the companies , and the partnership of Darling , Brown & Sharpe was formed
year and the buying out of Mr. _RARE_ interest in _RARE_ , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous _RARE_
outstanding standard _RARE_ of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. _RARE_ J. _RARE_ , whose mechanical genius closely _RARE_ that of Mr. Brown , and whose particular _RARE_ was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that _RARE_ Brown & Sharpe to manufacture _RARE_ , and therefore its products , with an accuracy _RARE_ anything then available elsewhere in the world
on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ of the company from _RARE_ to 1910
possessed remarkable _RARE_ for the leadership and development of men
an _RARE_ _RARE_ of the Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ Program and personal _RARE_ to _RARE_ able men who first developed their industrial _RARE_ with the company
sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial _RARE_ throughout the nation and even abroad
the death of _RARE_ Sharpe in _RARE_ , the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely _RARE_ with the _RARE_ of the company
_RARE_ , the company's physical plant was _RARE_ expanded , and the length and _RARE_ of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world
early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were _RARE_ as the largest single manufacturing _RARE_ devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world
years the company's product line followed the basic _RARE_ laid down by Mr. Brown
from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple _RARE_ gear cutting machines to gear _RARE_ machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from _RARE_ _RARE_ universal milling machines to a broad line of _RARE_ controlled _RARE_ and manufacturing type milling machines
grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal _RARE_ alone and took in cylindrical _RARE_ , surface _RARE_ , and a wide variety of special and _RARE_ models
, Henry D. Sharpe , Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the _RARE_ equipment business
is still broadening its line and is now active on four major _RARE_
_RARE_ Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single _RARE_ automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and _RARE_ milling machines
is the Brown & Sharpe _RARE_ _RARE_ machine which _RARE_ the company to an entirely new field of tool development
Industrial Products Division , the company _RARE_ and markets a wide line of precision _RARE_ and inspection equipment , _RARE_ tools -- including _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling _RARE_ , end mills and _RARE_
net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959
was _RARE_ , or _RARE_ per share on _RARE_ common shares currently outstanding , as compared to _RARE_ or _RARE_ per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares
other operating income increased _RARE_ from _RARE_ in 1959 to _RARE_ in 1960
was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development
of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate _RARE_ higher than during 1959
current year Our current rate of _RARE_ orders has now _RARE_ and unless this trend can be _RARE_ , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960
the healthy inventory position of the textile industry _RARE_ support to the _RARE_ expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961
sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a _RARE_ U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , _RARE_ the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on _RARE_ business in the next few years
depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in _RARE_ the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to _RARE_ the position of the dollar in foreign exchange
development Our research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against _RARE_ production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at _RARE_
is based on the policy of _RARE_ and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money
involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment , in terms of efficiency and _RARE_
important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and our more recent _RARE_ automatic _RARE_ machine
On this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to _RARE_ future growth in sales and earnings
this necessary increase in research and development , though properly _RARE_ to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years
machines In December we began to ship our _RARE_ stretch yarn machines
produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in _RARE_ stretch and _RARE_ fabrics
past year , great progress has been made by the _RARE_ mills in creating new stretch and _RARE_ fabrics
are now _RARE_ broad acceptance of sports _RARE_ and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and _RARE_ made from these fabrics
, operating at speeds up to _RARE_ _RARE_ per minute , is believed to provide one of the _RARE_ mechanical operations in industry today
yarn directly from the _RARE_ largest package into ideal supply _RARE_ for use on _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ stretch yarn fabrics
Our new _RARE_ ring _RARE_ for glass fiber yarns is _RARE_ well in our _RARE_ mills
the year , additional types of this _RARE_ _RARE_ will be made available to mills for other _RARE_ fibers and natural yarns
are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn _RARE_ , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn
believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment
activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of _RARE_ for production of the _RARE_ automatic _RARE_ machine
is _RARE_ on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year
was demonstrated in two textile machinery _RARE_ last year and was well received by the industry
market for the machine should be comparable to that of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ; it _RARE_ an automatic _RARE_ device on each _RARE_ , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new _RARE_ as the running end is exhausted
_RARE_ winding process is a relatively _RARE_ operation for the mill , the almost complete _RARE_ provided by the _RARE_ can mean important _RARE_ in textile production , at the same time _RARE_ quality
have already placed firm orders for this machine
application A new application for the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , running single filling for box _RARE_ , will broaden mill use of this equipment
A new spinning _RARE_ machine has been developed to _RARE_ the use of our _RARE_ machine in the production of _RARE_ yarns
equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed
machine takes up _RARE_ yarn from _RARE_ or _RARE_ and _RARE_ large _RARE_ at speeds up to _RARE_ feet per minute
equipped with an automatic _RARE_ device to reduce waste and handling time
machines and our _RARE_ are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high _RARE_ yarns , in several fiber producing plants
forward to a stronger position in this expanding field
We are interested in further _RARE_ into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently _RARE_ our efforts in that direction
research Our _RARE_ _RARE_ Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells
of our exclusive American _RARE_ , _RARE_ & _RARE_ _RARE_ Division of United _RARE_ Corporation , has been important in this work
to its major effort on fuel cells , _RARE_ _RARE_ Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account
currently supplying components vital to the _RARE_ and _RARE_ programs
recently entered into an agreement with _RARE_ _RARE_ De _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on _RARE_ materials
gives us rights for manufacturing and _RARE_ of such materials in the United States
will _RARE_ the _RARE_ materials and _RARE_ from France but later we will manufacture in this country
a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military
, we believe , will develop important commercial applications
for the Air Force has been completed in which the _RARE_ infrared _RARE_ device was developed for area _RARE_ of _RARE_ or dangerous _RARE_
_RARE_ research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity
advance in science today suggests many other _RARE_ of investigation
is to keep _RARE_ of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities
facilities Early in August we broke ground for a new _RARE_ plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and _RARE_ winding machinery operations
well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year
now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick
the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962
_RARE_ of the new plant is shown on the front cover
will contain _RARE_ square feet , approximately the same as our present plant
its modern _RARE_ _RARE_ is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs
consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force
entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant
During the year our British _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , expanded its plant in _RARE_ , England , and added machine tool capacity
of its other plant in _RARE_ and _RARE_ former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the _RARE_ town of _RARE_
equipment were _RARE_ and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis
available at _RARE_ is approximately three times the size of the former _RARE_ and Manchester locations
, land has been purchased to permit _RARE_ the size of the plant in the future
The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction
be _RARE_ on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island , a _RARE_ organization , which will _RARE_ us for the cost of construction
then _RARE_ the new plant under _RARE_ , with an _RARE_ to purchase
are , in our opinion , very favorable to _RARE_
of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The _RARE_ Manhattan Bank
to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately _RARE_ for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at _RARE_ , _RARE_
that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect _RARE_ which will fully justify the investment
loans have been reduced by _RARE_ to _RARE_
_RARE_ to _RARE_ during the year and should decline in coming months
enter 1961 in a strong financial position
In accordance with the _RARE_ contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , wages of _RARE_ employees were increased by _RARE_ in May , 1960 , and pay levels for _RARE_ _RARE_ employees were increased _RARE_
, Blue _RARE_ coverage for all employees and their _RARE_ was extended to provide the full cost of _RARE_ hospital _RARE_
In addition to direct _RARE_ and wages , the Company paid or _RARE_ during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees : During the _RARE_ year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of _RARE_ currently retired under the _RARE_ _RARE_ plan
13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service _RARE_ to qualified members of the plan , _RARE_ _RARE_
market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago
factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living
many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years
In textiles , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity
_RARE_ and manufacturer of textile production machinery , _RARE_ and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility
shifting _RARE_ The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in _RARE_ or home _RARE_
be adjusted _RARE_ , at minimum cost and quickly
, production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of _RARE_ , as well as _RARE_
term of service in Japan , each _RARE_ returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community
Service Fund provides the financial support for this program
the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital _RARE_ to campus life
for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ Club , and smaller _RARE_ of wind and _RARE_ players

Social _RARE_ is a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association
for the entire campus are planned by the _RARE_ Board
months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current _RARE_ in business and _RARE_ are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future
, despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new _RARE_ for the year as a whole
in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ inventories that have characterized many previous _RARE_ in the business cycle
has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of _RARE_ and _RARE_ to shift the inventory burden back on the _RARE_ , and the fact _RARE_ at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher _RARE_ at the manufacturing level
electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets
in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959
value of our industry's shipments , at factory prices , increased from _RARE_ billion in 1959 to approximately _RARE_ billion as a result of increases in all of the major _RARE_ of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement
a further gain is in prospect for 1961
sales up _RARE_ the largest percentage of _RARE_ sets such as _RARE_ and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about _RARE_ billion , compared to _RARE_ billion in 1959
TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ; set production ( excluding those _RARE_ for the _RARE_ market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was _RARE_ after the usual vacation _RARE_ in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been _RARE_ _RARE_
year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to _RARE_ million against _RARE_ million in 1959 ; ; however , production came to only _RARE_ million compared to _RARE_ million
to the lower _RARE_ of TV , total radio production increased from _RARE_ million sets to _RARE_ million ( excluding _RARE_ )
and _RARE_ _RARE_ were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ; sales and production of home sets were about equal at _RARE_ million units
production came to about _RARE_ million compared to _RARE_ million in 1959
also had a good year , reflecting the growing _RARE_ of _RARE_ sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to _RARE_ that characterized the _RARE_ market
for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of _RARE_ to step up their buying plans for _RARE_ goods
expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - _RARE_ but that _RARE_ levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent _RARE_ suggest they will
for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at _RARE_ million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in _RARE_ from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of _RARE_ - _RARE_ million sets
believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about _RARE_ million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959
to grow 1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which _RARE_ about _RARE_ billion compared to _RARE_ billion in 1959
interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in _RARE_ , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance
been _RARE_ pointed out by _RARE_ people in the industry that it is probably _RARE_ to expect a continuation of the _RARE_ growth of _RARE_ or better that characterized the decade of the _RARE_ , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still _RARE_ areas of our defense capability
may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions
items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the _RARE_ and _RARE_ programs , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ alert system of the _RARE_ Air Command , and improved _RARE_ _RARE_ systems
development expenditures connected with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as _RARE_ are expected to increase substantially
development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by _RARE_
, the realm of space technology will show substantial _RARE_ ; ; it has been estimated that spending by the National _RARE_ and _RARE_ Administration will rise from less than _RARE_ million in fiscal 1960 to more than _RARE_ billion by _RARE_ , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current _RARE_
defense procurement called for in the 1961 _RARE_ has already begun to make itself felt in an _RARE_ in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional _RARE_ billion increase in total defense spending may be _RARE_ for fiscal 1962
impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be _RARE_ , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least _RARE_ billion
equipment _RARE_ by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment _RARE_ _RARE_ billion compared to _RARE_ billion in 1959
for _RARE_ and other _RARE_ continues to _RARE_ at the rate of about _RARE_ _RARE_ , reaching some _RARE_ million in 1960
look for this market to approximately _RARE_ by the late _RARE_ , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , industrial process control , and information storage and _RARE_
industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright
near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ; sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach _RARE_ billion
In addition to the three major original equipment _RARE_ of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year
now a _RARE_ billion business , up from _RARE_ billion in 1959 , and should reach _RARE_ billion in 1961
for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment _RARE_ of the industry
parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates
military field , _RARE_ orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the _RARE_ in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components
_RARE_ in 1960 _RARE_ _RARE_ million , compared to _RARE_ million in 1959 despite substantial price _RARE_ in virtually all types
about _RARE_ million units against _RARE_ million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to _RARE_ million units worth approximately _RARE_ million in 1961
_RARE_ components , such as _RARE_ and resistors , although not growing as fast as those of _RARE_ were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961
, I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about _RARE_ to _RARE_ billion , despite the _RARE_ in the business outlook generally
have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer _RARE_ goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the _RARE_ figures close to those of 1960 ; ; on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ; and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the _RARE_

a member of the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , London , a registered professional engineer in _RARE_ and Ohio , and a _RARE_ electrical engineer in Great Britain
of Robert E. _RARE_ to the position of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by _RARE_ S. _RARE_ , _RARE_ of _RARE_ Control Field Service
was made in a move to _RARE_ the engineering services offered to the _RARE_ of electronic systems through assistance in _RARE_ _RARE_ problems
he helps the president keep track of _RARE_ matters
duties fit neatly with those of the proposed _RARE_ _RARE_ , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs
see themselves as _RARE_ professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is _RARE_ to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course
believes that broad _RARE_ is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship
_RARE_ faculty members to remember , in _RARE_ their _RARE_ , that they share no collective responsibility for the _RARE_ income nor are they personally _RARE_ for _RARE_ decisions
welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration
do faculty members govern themselves
little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government
pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government
too , need to learn to _RARE_
administration take details off their hands would give them more time to _RARE_ themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention
insist on governing themselves , they grant little _RARE_ to a member who _RARE_ _RARE_ in college or university government
, nevertheless , several things that the president can do to _RARE_ participation and to _RARE_ the _RARE_ of those who are willing to exercise their privilege
, for example , present significant _RARE_ issues to the _RARE_
encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the _RARE_ faculty ; ; by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ; by _RARE_ good _RARE_ between the committees and the administration ; ; by _RARE_ the number of committees
many _RARE_ for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , _RARE_ of a lack of communication _RARE_
is as often neglect as _RARE_ to _RARE_
president , _RARE_ with a problem and its _RARE_ and _RARE_ by pressures to meet _RARE_ , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is
for _RARE_ and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of _RARE_
faculty influence and decrease tension , many _RARE_ have established a standing _RARE_ committee with which they can discuss problems _RARE_
has little influence in _RARE_ _RARE_ changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to _RARE_ issues and throw out _RARE_ ideas , he can open the way for _RARE_ , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take
require _RARE_ , sensitivity to faculty _RARE_ , patience , and persistence
task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually _RARE_ and _RARE_ itself so that its performance will match changing social demands
do not automatically _RARE_ themselves
form an important bridge between the president and the faculty
not only as _RARE_ for their areas , but they also contribute to _RARE_ decision making
who _RARE_ strong men who have an _RARE_ or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance
depend on their department _RARE_ to promote their interests with the administration
at the same time , looks to the _RARE_ for strategic aid in building stronger departments
that this can be done , other than by _RARE_ new _RARE_ _RARE_ , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance
of a _RARE_ leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty
the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards , the president can encourage faculty leadership
can best help them by _RARE_ that _RARE_ criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and _RARE_ to
_RARE_ should take a direct , long-term interest in faculty development
_RARE_ will _RARE_ all through the year on personnel needs , plans for the future , qualifications of those on the job , and bright prospects elsewhere
maintenance of a long-term program , the departments , and particularly their _RARE_ , are strategic
and _RARE_ candidates for appointment and promotion
an independent judgment for the president , the academic _RARE_ also _RARE_ candidates thoroughly
colleges and universities , a faculty committee _RARE_ and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates
members and many _RARE_ _RARE_ faculty review groups because they either repeat _RARE_ actions or act _RARE_ _RARE_
be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and _RARE_ substantial time to the work
university , the president _RARE_ the faculty review committee as `` a _RARE_ partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty ''
president _RARE_ a _RARE_ to the trustees , the administration _RARE_ the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere
or _RARE_ _RARE_ some of his publications to form the _RARE_ possible evaluation of the quality of his mind
way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered , although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria
passing over quiet , _RARE_ teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made _RARE_ whether or not they have been recommended for _RARE_ by their departments
certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly
personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for _RARE_ , to guard against the mistake of making this _RARE_ serious _RARE_ turn solely upon the man's former achievements
can be as effective as the president in _RARE_ older men to welcome _RARE_ new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their _RARE_ is quite different
, the president may have to _RARE_ all his _RARE_ powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale
rare occasions when a faculty member on _RARE_ is not meeting the standards of the institution , the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action
university , like most successful marriages , is a unity of _RARE_ Without forcing all components into a single pattern , the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider _RARE_ of knowledge at its highest level , which a university -- in contrast to a _RARE_ -- should stand for
and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into _RARE_ goals
a few more institutions are deciding such questions as : Shall we require a liberal education built around a _RARE_ core for all _RARE_
we permit early _RARE_ in scientific and technological subjects
first instance , adequate appropriate reading materials and library _RARE_ must be planned
second , more shops , _RARE_ , and staff will be required
president , a master plan looking ahead five years ( the maximum reach for sound forecasting ) , offers several practical advantages
faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards
and equipment can be efficiently developed
programs can be examined for _RARE_ to goals and for present and future financial _RARE_
one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to _RARE_ major _RARE_
confidence in his _RARE_ determination to establish goals and to achieve them
where it is going , however , a college or university must know where it is
step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty , by outside _RARE_ , or by a combination of the two
_RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , faculty , organization , buildings , faculty work _RARE_ , and potential for growth in _RARE_ and size
the master plan will inevitably be _RARE_
will attack their new goals _RARE_ ; ; others may drag their feet
be readily _RARE_ for some purposes but not others
must therefore be brought up to date _RARE_ , possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer
the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions , a number of institutions have established offices of _RARE_ research
have very broad responsibilities , touching on almost all aspects of a _RARE_ _RARE_ program
include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations
, these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data
opportunity for _RARE_ education reaches its highest point , as he _RARE_ which projects he will cut back , which he will advance by increased _RARE_ or new _RARE_ efforts
how high the hopes and dreams of _RARE_ , budget making _RARE_ them to the cold _RARE_ of dollars and cents
budget goes to trustees for approval it is the _RARE_ budget , to which his faith and credit are committed ; ; its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment
, of course , examine each proposal from scratch
and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution
be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship
instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money , an institution should choose its fields of _RARE_
will be headed for _RARE_ , at worst , and at best towards _RARE_ of other less dramatic but socially and _RARE_ _RARE_ branches of learning
national interest even the _RARE_ universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present _RARE_ to keep up with the _RARE_ in all branches
-- business management , public relations , _RARE_ -- offer _RARE_ one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education
reasonable _RARE_ of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role
areas that do not _RARE_ directly to the educational program , expert _RARE_ will serve the college or university better than close _RARE_ attention
should find strong _RARE_ and _RARE_ the _RARE_ discretion to them
cannot compete with the salary _RARE_ of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income
the entire faculty should know the _RARE_ educational philosophy and objectives , so should _RARE_ officers
better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of _RARE_ goals
is frequently _RARE_ to serve in _RARE_ civic and governmental _RARE_ , to make speeches to lay groups , and to make numerous _RARE_ _RARE_ on and off campus
can neither accept nor _RARE_ them all , he must be _RARE_ by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations
_RARE_ are better received when he _RARE_ why his obligations to his institution _RARE_ his acceptance
the load of important speeches with his colleagues , the president can develop a _RARE_ of able _RARE_ who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution , something more than the _RARE_ shadow of one man

has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their _RARE_
of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal _RARE_ of the surface _RARE_ which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during _RARE_ ( e.g. , _RARE_ , 1958 )
accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and _RARE_ materials of the moon
the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will _RARE_ the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using _RARE_ wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise _RARE_ information about the characteristics of the solid surface
of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets
intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about _RARE_
suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and _RARE_ components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence
case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a _RARE_ _RARE_ , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and _RARE_ components
remaining planets , only Mars and _RARE_ have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available
been observed twice at about _RARE_ wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars
intensity of the radiation from _RARE_ has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin
to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small _RARE_ , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity
of this , the very large radio _RARE_ and improved _RARE_ techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years
of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at _RARE_ wave length by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1946 )
followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the _RARE_ emission of the moon over three lunar _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1949 )
from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a _RARE_ in a roughly _RARE_ fashion ; ; that the _RARE_ of the variation was considerably less than the _RARE_ of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) ; ; and that the maximum of the radio emission came about _RARE_ days after _RARE_ _RARE_ , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ explained their observations by pointing out that _RARE_ materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially _RARE_ to radio waves , although _RARE_ to infrared radiation
emission could then be assumed to _RARE_ at the surface of the moon , while the radio emission _RARE_ at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in _RARE_ and shifted in phase
absorption of radio waves in _RARE_ material varies with wave length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly _RARE_ changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material
emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1955 ) identified the origin of _RARE_ radio noise on their records at about 15 _RARE_ wave length as emission from Jupiter
type of planetary radiation is discussed by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 13 ) and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 14 )
which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at _RARE_ and _RARE_ cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at _RARE_ cm in 1956 ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , 1958 , A , B , C ) , and from _RARE_ at _RARE_ cm in 1957 ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1958 )
relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from _RARE_ to _RARE_ cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the _RARE_ range from _RARE_ to _RARE_ Aj
characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity , the _RARE_ , and the direction of arrival of the waves
angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc
much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large _RARE_ now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be _RARE_
be possible , however , to put useful limits on the _RARE_ of the radio sources by observing with large _RARE_ or with _RARE_
_RARE_ are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth
been few measurements specifically for the determination of the _RARE_ of planetary radiation
made with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , which is _RARE_ , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured _RARE_ of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been _RARE_ _RARE_
measurements ( _RARE_ and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the _RARE_ emission of Jupiter to be partially _RARE_ and to _RARE_ in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk
this very significant result , most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation
of apparent _RARE_ temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets
radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which _RARE_ the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet
_RARE_ disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation
of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really _RARE_ as a black body , will the apparent _RARE_ temperature _RARE_ to the physical temperature of the _RARE_ material
radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at _RARE_ wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional _RARE_ of solar radio noise
level of _RARE_ _RARE_ solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than _RARE_
wave lengths an increase of the order of _RARE_ in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected
_RARE_ the extreme _RARE_ , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause _RARE_ errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ range

_RARE_ observations Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from _RARE_ _RARE_ to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1
also been made at 1.5 _RARE_ using optical techniques ( _RARE_ , 1955 , 1956 , ; ; see also _RARE_ 11 )
the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of _RARE_ the _RARE_ and _RARE_ , must account for much of the _RARE_ in the measured radio brightness temperatures
observations at _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , 1959 ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , _RARE_ , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and _RARE_ _RARE_ have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases
indicate that the lunar _RARE_ heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the _RARE_ regions
seems to be an exception and remains _RARE_ than the regions which _RARE_ it
_RARE_ also suggest a rather rapid _RARE_ in the radio brightness with _RARE_
, observations have been made at _RARE_ wave length with a _RARE_ 22 _RARE_ in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , 1960 )
contours are much _RARE_ than those observed at _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ ( 1959 ) and apparently the emission at 8 _RARE_ is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features
observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted
of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ at _RARE_ cm and of _RARE_ at _RARE_ cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described
_RARE_ cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the _RARE_ _RARE_ at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington
diameter of the antenna beam was about _RARE_ , and the angle _RARE_ by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side _RARE_
patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , 1958 ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known
of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift _RARE_ across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by _RARE_ integration of the antenna _RARE_ _RARE_ , to be _RARE_
brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the _RARE_ disk is nearly uniform
of the observations is Af where the phase angle , Q , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors
is plotted along with the _RARE_ observations of _RARE_ ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , A
in the _RARE_ emission of the moon during a _RARE_ is very much less than the variation in the _RARE_ emission , as would be expected from the explanation of _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1949 )
discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ variation will be called the variable component
observation of _RARE_ was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the _RARE_ _RARE_ at the Maryland Point _RARE_ of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory
of the moon was about 2 days
diameter of the main _RARE_ of the antenna was about _RARE_ , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a _RARE_ shape for the antenna beam and a _RARE_ bright disk for the moon
were made on an electric arc applying a porous _RARE_ anode cooled by a _RARE_ gas ( _RARE_ )
the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc
shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately _RARE_ of the total arc energy
energy balance of the anode was established
_RARE_ could be reduced to a negligible amount
of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the _RARE_ gas was investigated for various arc lengths and _RARE_ between 100 _RARE_ and 200 Aj
were made and _RARE_ motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow _RARE_
high heat _RARE_ existing at the _RARE_ surfaces of electric arcs _RARE_ extensive cooling to prevent _RARE_ _RARE_
requirements are particularly severe at the anode
electric arcs , for instance , approximately _RARE_ of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat _RARE_ in excess of Af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere
generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode
heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs
generators the _RARE_ forced _RARE_ may _RARE_ the picture somewhat
transfer to the anode is due to the following effects : 1
_RARE_ ( work function ) plus kinetic energy of the _RARE_ _RARE_ on the anode
transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode _RARE_

by molecular _RARE_ as well as by radiation from the arc column
transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is _RARE_ by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with _RARE_ up Af
has been experimentally investigated in detail by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 1 )
gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode )
the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs _RARE_ those near a _RARE_ point
apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode
flow through a plasma generator will _RARE_ these conditions ; ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux
to improve the life of the _RARE_ or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss
possibilities exist for achieving this : 1
of high _RARE_ and low _RARE_ by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output

of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces

the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas _RARE_ through the anode
method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by C. _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 2 )
of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a _RARE_ cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage
through a porous anode ( _RARE_ cooling ) not only _RARE_ back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also _RARE_ the conditions in the arc itself
study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper
used as a blowing gas to _RARE_ any effects of _RARE_ or chemical reaction
material was porous _RARE_
_RARE_ should be _RARE_ in principle
technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots
arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs
direct _RARE_ can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( _RARE_ 3 )
Figures 1 to 3 show _RARE_ and _RARE_ views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder
consisted of a _RARE_ '' diameter _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ attached to a water cooled _RARE_ tube
could be adjusted in its _RARE_ direction by an electric drive to establish the required _RARE_ _RARE_
in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk
gas _RARE_ from the anode formed a jet directed _RARE_ towards the cathode below
air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two _RARE_ shown in figure 2
also _RARE_ at low _RARE_ ( mass flow rate Af ) through a tube _RARE_ with the cathode as an additional _RARE_ against _RARE_ of the arc by air
consisted of a _RARE_ inch diameter porous _RARE_ plug , _RARE_ inch long
was National _RARE_ _RARE_ 60 , which has a _RARE_ of 50% and an average _RARE_ size of 30
_RARE_ size was required to _RARE_ uniformity of the flow leaving the anode
plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder
_RARE_ was used to measure the _RARE_ temperature of the _RARE_ gas
exposed to a high velocity gas jet
and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the _RARE_ above the porous plug into two parts
had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the _RARE_ by natural _RARE_
shown in figure 1 and 2 ( _RARE_ _RARE_ Co. _RARE_ _RARE_ ) served for _RARE_ measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder
were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature
holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3
design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by _RARE_ from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the _RARE_
heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the _RARE_ of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air _RARE_ of _RARE_ inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder
, the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation
the shield and of the surface of the _RARE_ anode holder were measured by _RARE_ to account for heat received by the _RARE_ but not _RARE_ from the anode plug
flow from commercial bottles was _RARE_ by a pressure _RARE_ and measured with a gas flow _RARE_
source was a commercial D. C. _RARE_
_RARE_ the _RARE_ cycle _RARE_ was less than _RARE_ V ( peak to peak ) with a _RARE_ load
was _RARE_ by means of a variable _RARE_ and measured with a 50 _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
voltage was measured with a _RARE_ whose _RARE_ were connected to the anode and cathode _RARE_
the falling characteristic of the _RARE_ , no _RARE_ _RARE_ was required for stability of operation
frequency _RARE_ was used to start the arc
and error analysis 1
anode with carbon anode holder The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind
losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made
to reduce the number of variable parameters , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of _RARE_ '' and a current of 100 Aj
flow through the porous anode was varied _RARE_ between Af and Af
limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous _RARE_ plug and that it became highly unstable
limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc
which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously
mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured
the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a _RARE_
turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug
was denoted by Af
of this hot region was estimated by eye
of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug
temperature of this region was _RARE_ by the temperature measured _RARE_ between the edge of the hot spot and the _RARE_ of the plug
denoted by Af
temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : Af where _RARE_ is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot
equilibrium between the anode surface and the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the gas _RARE_ rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation Af whereby the specific heat of _RARE_ was taken as Af
results in an _RARE_ rise which is somewhat high because it _RARE_ a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures
gas temperature measured with the _RARE_ shown in figure 2 was Af
values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc _RARE_
the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements _RARE_ _RARE_ were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2
these temperatures are plotted in figure 4
no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements
the _RARE_ line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates
in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of Af
was taken as _RARE_ temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned
sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux _RARE_ from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements
of radiation _RARE_ from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry
heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts
calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af
heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby Af
distribution of figure 4 gives Af for all blowing rates , assuming Af
dependent value of _RARE_ was taken from _RARE_ 7
loss from the anode surface was computed according to Af where Af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures Af and Af calculated _RARE_ to equation ( 1 )
_RARE_ is shown in Figure 2
of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by _RARE_
a small well in the top in which the fluid or _RARE_ to be tested is placed
of cellulose _RARE_ is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or _RARE_ with it between the parallel faces of the blocks
use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks
has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded
use of various weights , data for a _RARE_ of shear graph can be obtained
used for this work was a slight _RARE_ of that previously described
test a Af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and _RARE_ at a rate of Af with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' on each side of the tape
a rate of shear of Af
however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the _RARE_ was increased by the _RARE_ of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the _RARE_ during the runs
of one block contained a hole _RARE_ '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure
were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types
the fluids showed a _RARE_ normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two
shows the data on a _RARE_ fluid , labeled _RARE_ _RARE_ which gave a high positive normal pressure
tape was run for over 1 _RARE_ , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate
had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time
pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure
method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of _RARE_ ( molecular weight reported to be _RARE_ ) was over half an atmosphere
pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand
fluids which gave the small negative pressures were _RARE_ with molecular weights which were stated to be _RARE_ and 300
fluids which one would expect to be less _RARE_ or more _RARE_ because of their lower molecular weight
_RARE_ was _RARE_ '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids
presumed that this negative head was associated with some _RARE_ factor of the assembly , since different _RARE_ were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and _RARE_ of the apparatus
pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the _RARE_ by several _RARE_
can be considered _RARE_ only
they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were _RARE_ by the theory in the first part of the paper
give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures
instrument would be useful for the _RARE_ of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies
is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials
instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the _RARE_ of heavy _RARE_ such as printing _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ plastics , and bread dough , for the _RARE_ is related to those various properties _RARE_ `` length '' , `` _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ '' , etc. , which are usually _RARE_ by subjective methods at present
change Af caused by a shear field is calculated by _RARE_ the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any _RARE_ or _RARE_ pressure head
volume is the _RARE_ volume , then Af is obtained on a _RARE_ basis which is the customary _RARE_ of the _RARE_
Af calculation is obvious by _RARE_ with that for _RARE_ field and _RARE_ pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects
shear field with a height of H and a _RARE_ area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of H ( referred to the same base as H ) and a _RARE_ area of A
is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and _RARE_ is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is Af
the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H
volume of the system above the reference height is Af , and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H
total potential energy is found by taking the _RARE_ with respect to H and _RARE_ to zero
Af , which is the pressure
interesting for it _RARE_ both the _RARE_ concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium
can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields
between _RARE_ pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an _RARE_ way
above development we have applied the _RARE_ of equilibrium ( referred to by some as _RARE_ ) to the steady state
be justified _RARE_ in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared
an interesting _RARE_ with the assumption stated by _RARE_ that `` the _RARE_ mechanics of _RARE_ solids can be applied to flowing solutions ''
one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar
mechanics are similar , we can also _RARE_ that the _RARE_ will also be similar
of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and _RARE_ a force normal to the _RARE_ face is compatible with the information obtained from optical _RARE_ studies of fluids undergoing shear
_RARE_ studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at _RARE_ to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves _RARE_ toward the direction of shear
_RARE_ , the _RARE_ shear S is given by Af where **yc is the angle of _RARE_
and the force of _RARE_ it should be possible to _RARE_ the _RARE_ energy of _RARE_ which should be equal to the Af calculated from the pressure normal to the _RARE_ face
another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in _RARE_ fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields
are _RARE_ by the normal forces just as a _RARE_ would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands
appear to be _RARE_ , and it is _RARE_ convenient to assume that they are
are not _RARE_ , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation
of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the _RARE_
Taylor both show that the major axis of the _RARE_ is at _RARE_ at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear
_RARE_ break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become _RARE_ to it without _RARE_
is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by _RARE_ studies
forces can be calculated from the various _RARE_ of _RARE_ if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop
) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions
) The kinetic effects are negligible
) Since the shape of the drop _RARE_ to the force field , it does not _RARE_ affect the distribution of forces in the fluid
reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear
the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is Af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is Af , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is Af , where _RARE_ is the interfacial tension and Af and Af are the two _RARE_ of _RARE_
is given by _RARE_ and _RARE_
is the major axis of an _RARE_ and B and C are the other two axes , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ plane at the end of the axis Af , and the difference in pressure along the A and B axes is Af
no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas
there are photographs of suspended drops of _RARE_ _RARE_ ( viscosity _RARE_ _RARE_ ) suspended in corn _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ in a paper by _RARE_ and _RARE_
of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible
the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af
is assumed that the formula given by _RARE_ of _RARE_ Af applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of _RARE_ of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated
was Af from the above data
to be high , as would be expected from the _RARE_ viscosity of the material in the drops
appropriate to call attention to certain _RARE_ properties of an ideal gas that are _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_
energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume
words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in _RARE_ it is completely _RARE_ into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink
that work _RARE_ Q which in turn _RARE_ Af
a well-known relationship between probability and _RARE_ which states that Af , where _RARE_ is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone
known as _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ is , in this case , equal to the usual _RARE_ , for there are no other changes or other energies involved
though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does _RARE_ an increased pressure
for any _RARE_ work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its _RARE_
magnetic resonance study of _RARE_ Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented
paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic _RARE_ as well as nuclear _RARE_ effects lead to line broadening
are _RARE_ and over the range of field Af _RARE_ and temperature Af the _RARE_ increases with increasing Af and _RARE_ T
resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak _RARE_ _RARE_ contact interaction
theory of resonance _RARE_ is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Af of a _RARE_ paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Af
_RARE_ a linear dependence of Af on Af , where _RARE_ is the experimentally determined _RARE_ constant
second moment Af _RARE_ to the relation Af in agreement with theory
the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( _RARE_ )
_RARE_ effects provide some information on the particle shapes
_RARE_ effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the _RARE_ of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt
magnetic moment of an _RARE_ electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei
important to consider and experimentally _RARE_ this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure
to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal _RARE_ , with three _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong Af bond provides structural interest
discuss the Af bond in Af
_RARE_ the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic _RARE_ with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment
is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects
provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various _RARE_ models of the Af bond in Af
in Af _RARE_ studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the Af bond will be linear in the absence of _RARE_ of packing in the solid
it will be _RARE_ until a certain critical Af distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric
ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric
distance in Af is _RARE_ Aj
evidence , though less _RARE_ than for Af , that the Af bond in _RARE_ _RARE_ is symmetric
Af distance is _RARE_ Aj
of _RARE_ estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about _RARE_ to _RARE_ A , but aside from the possible example of _RARE_ _RARE_ there have been no _RARE_ reports of symmetric Af bonds
studied the crystal structure of Af by _RARE_ diffraction
the structure contains an Af bond with the Af distance of Af
, then , the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its _RARE_ from his _RARE_ data
Af to be _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ Af , with Af , Af
experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic _RARE_ density of Af
data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for _RARE_ led him to assume a center of _RARE_
assumption the space group must be Af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell

group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric
powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af
lead to a structure in which sheets of _RARE_ atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms
atoms in each sheet are close packed and each _RARE_ atom is surrounded by a _RARE_ _RARE_ of O atoms
layers are stacked normal to the ( _RARE_ ) axis with the lower _RARE_ of one _RARE_ directly above the upper _RARE_ of the _RARE_ lower _RARE_ , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers
layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds
of the structure is to be found in reference 6
details of the structure appear reasonable
appears to be unique among _RARE_ compounds , but is the same as that assumed by Af
angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal
the possible absence of a center of _RARE_ not only moves the hydrogen atom off Af , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become _RARE_ , with Af at Af and Af at Af ( space group Af ) , where Af represents the _RARE_ on one side of the Af layers and Af those on the other side
any oxygen _RARE_ would _RARE_ either the already extremely short Af _RARE_ distance of _RARE_ A or the _RARE_ Af _RARE_ _RARE_ which are already quite short at _RARE_ Aj
is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from _RARE_ _RARE_
effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to _RARE_ general , rather than special , positions along the ( _RARE_ ) axis
Af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet _RARE_ between the oxygen sheets ; ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ; ( 3 ) hydrogen atoms are _RARE_ placed , either _RARE_ or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms
2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a _RARE_ effect and on general chemical structural grounds
of `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' is more likely than ordered `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists
the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located _RARE_ ( 1 ) or _RARE_ ( 3 )
samples Douglass prepared his sample of Af by thermal decomposition of aqueous _RARE_ acid at 300 - _RARE_
was kind enough to _RARE_ us about 5 _RARE_ of his material
proved to be _RARE_ , since we could not obtain _RARE_ results on various portions of the sample
we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af _RARE_
is _RARE_ , we felt that any results obtained from the _RARE_ _RARE_ Af would be suspect
another preparation of Af which we used here
of _RARE_ aqueous Af with 1 Af added are heated in a bomb at _RARE_ for _RARE_ hours
fine , gray solid ( about 15 _RARE_ ) is formed , _RARE_ by _RARE_ , and dried at _RARE_ )
analysis showed a very small _RARE_ reaction at _RARE_ and a large _RARE_ reaction at _RARE_
reaction is in _RARE_ with the reported decomposition of Af
showed a weight loss of _RARE_ centered at _RARE_ and another weight loss of _RARE_ at _RARE_
weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is _RARE_
analysis of _RARE_ _RARE_ upon _RARE_ to _RARE_ indicated nitrogen _RARE_ and water vapor
reaction occurring at _RARE_ is probably caused by decomposition of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and perhaps by a small amount of some _RARE_ material other than Af
measurements were made on material which had been heated to _RARE_ for one hour
indicated Af _RARE_ and all other impurities much lower
gave _RARE_ _RARE_ as compared with _RARE_ theory
Af _RARE_ water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low _RARE_ analysis and high total weight loss
diffraction pattern of the material , taken with _RARE_ radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass
by R. G. _RARE_ of this laboratory indicated no _RARE_ impurities
found to be paramagnetic with three _RARE_ _RARE_ per _RARE_ atom and a molecular _RARE_ of Af , where Af
three _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ would be _RARE_
spectrum , obtained by H. A. _RARE_ and R. G. _RARE_ of this laboratory , showed bands in the positions found by Jones
examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly _RARE_ particles about _RARE_ in diameter
appeared rough and undoubtedly the _RARE_ _RARE_ are smaller than this
data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater
no obvious effects due to preferred _RARE_ of the _RARE_ in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron _RARE_ examination
resonance ( _RARE_ ) measurements The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by _RARE_ a _RARE_ model Af broad line _RARE_ and the associated _RARE_ _RARE_ system
at 40 _RARE_ was obtained with the _RARE_ model Af unit
type of bridge was used in the 10 - 16 _RARE_ range
power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape _RARE_ by _RARE_ effects
frequency of 40 _RARE_ with an _RARE_ as small as possible , _RARE_ with reasonably good _RARE_ quality , was used
were obtained in all cases
was adjusted to minimize the amount of _RARE_ mode mixed in with the absorption signal
value of the thermal _RARE_ time Af at room temperature was measured by the progressive _RARE_ method
of Af estimated at _RARE_ _RARE_ was Af _RARE_
measurement of the _RARE_ - _RARE_ _RARE_ time Af was obtained at 10 _RARE_ by _RARE_ methods
was obtained by W. _RARE_ of the University of California , _RARE_ , by observing the _RARE_ of the free _RARE_ _RARE_ signal
derived was 16 _RARE_
were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero
of the spectra were computed by numerical integration
applied for _RARE_ broadening , apparatus background , and field shift
obtained over the temperature range of _RARE_ - _RARE_
_RARE_ measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of _RARE_ and _RARE_
was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour )
, which had been exposed to the atmosphere after _RARE_ at _RARE_ , showed the presence of _RARE_ water ( about _RARE_ _RARE_ ) ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to broadening , at low temperature
reported here are either from spectra from which the _RARE_ water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples _RARE_ and sealed off at _RARE_ which contain no _RARE_ water
powder density of the Af used here was about Af , approximately _RARE_ that of the crystal density ( Af )
density _RARE_ to a paramagnetic _RARE_ density of about Af
obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular _RARE_ with a _RARE_ ratio of 4 : : 1
of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom _RARE_
also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube
was filled to the top and special _RARE_ were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary
also obtained from a third sample of Af which had been _RARE_ to three times its original volume with powdered , _RARE_ _RARE_ ( Af )
was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above
renewed life to soap products at a time when _RARE_ were a threat though expensive , and these same _RARE_ _RARE_ the decline of soap usage when the _RARE_ between _RARE_ and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and _RARE_
today for detergent builders is quite _RARE_
known field of application for builders is in _RARE_ , _RARE_ detergent formulations for household use
advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on _RARE_ , synthetic organic actives ( sodium _RARE_ ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium _RARE_ or a mixture of sodium _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
household market , there are also _RARE_ detergent formulations based on _RARE_ actives with about the same amount of phosphate _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ synthetic _RARE_ with much less _RARE_ ; ; and the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ as well as soap _RARE_ and _RARE_ , none of which are now _RARE_ advertised
_RARE_ which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is _RARE_ of _RARE_ and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high _RARE_ ratio
in household application is represented by two classes of _RARE_ products : ( 1 ) the formulations made _RARE_ for machine _RARE_ , and ( 2 ) the _RARE_ _RARE_ used for walls and _RARE_
quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders
, many of the hard-surface _RARE_ used for walls and _RARE_ had their _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ , which is still the major _RARE_ of a number of such products
_RARE_ now also contain _RARE_
_RARE_ are discussed in Chapter 28
process _RARE_ or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces
involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material
_RARE_ between _RARE_ and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved
of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of Af
, a metal _RARE_ Af in size would have a magnitude from _RARE_ to a million less
there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in _RARE_ , _RARE_ capacity , and chemical reactivity
a _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface _RARE_
considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning
_RARE_ values , such as _RARE_ or _RARE_ level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high
how they are _RARE_ , a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal
best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation
formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many _RARE_ ; ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' and dirty spots -- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash
washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of _RARE_
indicated that two devices , the _RARE_ and _RARE_ are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics
are several laboratory wash procedures in general use
fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash
way , numerical values for the relative _RARE_ of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) of the cloth _RARE_ before and after washing
is evaluated by washing clean _RARE_ with the dirty ones
the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high
of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the _RARE_ over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice
of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex
cleaning , the inorganic _RARE_ are more important than the organic active
when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any _RARE_ or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ are important inorganic _RARE_ of hard-surface _RARE_
, the _RARE_ are also used , probably acting more as _RARE_ agents than anything else
of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers
of washing Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their _RARE_ are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an _RARE_ picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces
of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are _RARE_ _RARE_ in the four major categories given below : 1
which is here defined as _RARE_ material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely _RARE_ divided so as to exhibit _RARE_ properties

, which are _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ of _RARE_ with _RARE_ organic _RARE_ )

which include the wide variety of _RARE_ materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object

, which primarily include sticky substances and _RARE_ _RARE_ which _RARE_ to leave a _RARE_
on the soiled objects is _RARE_ held by surface _RARE_ to some extent
a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ forces
a _RARE_ complicated _RARE_ interaction which causes any extremely small _RARE_ particle to _RARE_ with other small _RARE_ particles , or to stick to an _RARE_ surface
if _RARE_ particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be _RARE_ and the tendency to _RARE_ will be greatly _RARE_
a charged particle will tend to stick to an _RARE_ surface and vice _RARE_ , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface _RARE_ an opposite charge
, dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of _RARE_ , including liquid _RARE_
_RARE_ , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface
cases , these soils are taken up as _RARE_ through capillary action
essentially static system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial _RARE_ of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent
process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to _RARE_ the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to _RARE_ off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a _RARE_ and _RARE_ agent
are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; ; and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as _RARE_ _RARE_ which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove
_RARE_ are used
active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils
constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty _RARE_ and the _RARE_ sticky or dried soils
well known , detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of _RARE_ high molecular weight and highly _RARE_ _RARE_ which exhibit the property of forming _RARE_ in solution
of anionic _RARE_ , including the _RARE_ , have shown that there is little polymerization or _RARE_ of the chain _RARE_ below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration
) Below the critical micelle concentration , _RARE_ and some _RARE_ are present
) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid _RARE_ or polymerization to give the _RARE_ , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80
) For _RARE_ , these _RARE_ appear to be roughly spherical _RARE_ in which the _RARE_ _RARE_ come together so that the _RARE_ groups ( the _RARE_ ends ) face _RARE_ towards the aqueous continuous phase
( _RARE_ ) substances such as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase
_RARE_ and hold a considerable amount of _RARE_ substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately _RARE_
matter has not been _RARE_ demonstrated , the available data show that _RARE_ in themselves do not contribute significantly to the _RARE_ process
micelle formation is the _RARE_ important ability of detergent actives to _RARE_ at oil - water _RARE_ in such a manner that the _RARE_ ( or _RARE_ ) end of the _RARE_ is directed towards the aqueous phase and the _RARE_ chain towards the oily phase
cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become _RARE_ in this manner with an oriented film of _RARE_
washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that _RARE_ _RARE_ can _RARE_ themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase
a substance which is _RARE_ or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to _RARE_ this process and effectively push off the greasy soil
than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous _RARE_ onto surfaces of other _RARE_ condensed phases
particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall into the class of _RARE_
usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil - water _RARE_ , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at _RARE_ between water and insoluble materials _RARE_ an _RARE_ structure ( see Table _RARE_ on p. _RARE_ )
for aqueous _RARE_ , we can think of the _RARE_ organic active as an _RARE_ or _RARE_ surface-active agent , and of an _RARE_ _RARE_ as a _RARE_ or _RARE_ surface-active agent
equilibrium _RARE_ data which are available , it seems logical to expect that _RARE_ ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge
particles then _RARE_ each other and are also _RARE_ from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions
charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase
is _RARE_ in _RARE_ to the demonstrated action of organic actives in _RARE_
not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on _RARE_ phenomena which will be discussed later ( see _RARE_ _RARE_ - _RARE_ )
picture of the _RARE_ process thus far developed can be represented as : Af
of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale
must be dispersed and protected against _RARE_
must be protected against the _RARE_ of dispersed soil
evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent _RARE_ acting alone are severe
of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` _RARE_ '' properties has gained widespread acceptance
over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each _RARE_ of a _RARE_ formulation ; ; and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the _RARE_ roles of the active , _RARE_ , _RARE_ agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous _RARE_ making up a given commercial organic active
exchange of chlorine between Af and liquid Af is readily _RARE_ at temperatures in the range of _RARE_ and above
exchange occurs with a _RARE_ yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at _RARE_ using light absorbed only by the Af
gas phase , with Af of Af and Af of Af , _RARE_ _RARE_ of the order of Af have been observed at _RARE_
attempts to obtain highly pure _RARE_ , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining _RARE_ rates of reaction
possible to set a lower limit of about Af for the activation energy of the _RARE_ of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride _RARE_ by a chlorine atom to form Af radical
of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical _RARE_ are removed at the walls or by reaction with an _RARE_ rather than by _RARE_ radical combination reactions
of the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ exchange reactions between _RARE_ _RARE_ and the corresponding carbon _RARE_ would appear to offer particularly _RARE_ possibilities for obtaining _RARE_ basic kinetic data
appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free _RARE_ , as well as information on the heat of _RARE_ of the _RARE_ bond
of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies
be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic _RARE_ on a vacuum system followed by multiple _RARE_ of the liquid
be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any _RARE_ substances by the usual _RARE_ methods followed by _RARE_ prior to addition of _RARE_ chlorine
the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be _RARE_ to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for _RARE_ of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; ; also it would be expected that Af would compete very effectively with any impurities as a _RARE_ for Af _RARE_
these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of _RARE_ one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure _RARE_
reporting these investigations here briefly because of their _RARE_ to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for _RARE_ of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride

highest _RARE_ tank chlorine was passed through a tube of _RARE_ Af into an _RARE_ _RARE_ system where it was condensed with liquid air
then _RARE_ at least three times from a trap at _RARE_ to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each _RARE_
product was stored at _RARE_ in a tube equipped with a break seal
methods employed for _RARE_ chlorine with _RARE_ , the exchange of _RARE_ chlorine with _RARE_ aluminum _RARE_ at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory
the latter , silver _RARE_ was precipitated from a solution containing Af obtained from the _RARE_ _RARE_ National Laboratory
_RARE_ was _RARE_ under vacuum in the presence of aluminum _RARE_ with the resultant product of Af which was _RARE_ into a _RARE_ on the vacuum line
chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place
was stored at _RARE_ in a tube equipped with a break seal
of _RARE_ , low _RARE_ , _RARE_ grade carbon tetrachloride were _RARE_ with Af and Af and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 _RARE_ _RARE_ lamp at a distance of a few inches
was then _RARE_ with _RARE_ and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was _RARE_ on a _RARE_ column , a _RARE_ center cut being retained which was then _RARE_ under vacuum in the presence of Af
chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a _RARE_ equipped with a break seal
tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the _RARE_ was _RARE_ onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine _RARE_ off
amount of carbon tetrachloride was _RARE_ into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line
amounts of _RARE_ chlorine and _RARE_ chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off
of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking , _RARE_ to the reaction tubes , frozen down , and each tube was then sealed off
for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a _RARE_ attached to the manifold and then allowed to _RARE_ slowly into the manifold of _RARE_ reaction cells before _RARE_ off
in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of _RARE_ in each of the six cells from a set
and analysis
samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in _RARE_ capillary _RARE_ _RARE_ mm. _RARE_ and about 15 cm. long
few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of 1 mm. wall thickness
of tube _RARE_ the pressure of approximately 20 _RARE_ exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at _RARE_
reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ cm. long , diffraction effects being _RARE_ by the fact that the light passed through only _RARE_ _RARE_ and not _RARE_ _RARE_
were used rather than square _RARE_ _RARE_ because of the tendency of the latter to _RARE_ when _RARE_ frozen carbon tetrachloride
cells were _RARE_ _RARE_ in the light beam which entered the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ through a window
of light source were used , a thousand _RARE_ _RARE_ lamp and an _RARE_ high pressure _RARE_ arc
was _RARE_ by the soft glass window of the _RARE_ thus _RARE_ that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell
light _RARE_ were measured with a _RARE_ _RARE_ system
intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell
the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a _RARE_ aqueous sodium iodide solution
was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing _RARE_ _RARE_ were _RARE_ in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide )
of the _RARE_ Af with Af , _RARE_ of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a _RARE_ _RARE_ tube
liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by _RARE_ the tube before opening and _RARE_ the _RARE_ after _RARE_
of exchange was determined as the ratio of the _RARE_ / minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the _RARE_ / minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride , _RARE_ determined _RARE_ being made for the difference in counting efficiency of Af in Af and Af
thermal reaction
studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold _RARE_ were prepared and analyzed
done at _RARE_ , 200 , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
of the fact that the reaction rates of _RARE_ identical reaction _RARE_ prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be _RARE_ to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or _RARE_ or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes
to the method described in the section above , chlorine and _RARE_ were prepared by the _RARE_ of a Af _RARE_ on the vacuum line , and by exchange of Af with _RARE_ Af
was substituted for Af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride
between these variables and the _RARE_ of the results was found
rates observed at _RARE_ ranged from Af of the chlorine _RARE_ per hour to _RARE_ _RARE_ per hour
cases the chlorine concentration was about Af
reaction tubes containing _RARE_ of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added _RARE_ in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of _RARE_ to _RARE_ of the chlorine _RARE_ per hour
reaction was found at room temperature for reaction _RARE_ allowed to stand up to 5 hours
phase photochemical reaction
phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more _RARE_ than the thermal exchange , although still _RARE_
was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold
differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold _RARE_
reaction tubes from 13 manifold _RARE_ were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to _RARE_ in a further _RARE_ to determine the cause of the _RARE_ and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity
cases there was readily _RARE_ exchange after as little as one hour of _RARE_
reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature _RARE_ corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18 Af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases
possible to make estimates of the _RARE_ yield by observing the extent of reduction of a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate _RARE_ based on the differences in the absorption spectra of _RARE_ _RARE_ and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source
indicated that the _RARE_ yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at _RARE_ is of the order of magnitude of unity
reaction cells to which _RARE_ of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and _RARE_ were produced
also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af
exchange in the gas phase
there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently _RARE_ so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate
such _RARE_ together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table 1
series 1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from _RARE_ to _RARE_ cm.
column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( _RARE_ cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is _RARE_ proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity
of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen
effect ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ and Whipple , _RARE_ ) , which is a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ motion of particles by the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ force of the _RARE_ solar radiation , causes the dust to _RARE_ into the sun in times much _RARE_ than the age of the Earth
velocity varies _RARE_ as the particle size -- a _RARE_ particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years
1955 ) extends the effects to include the _RARE_ pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag
the _RARE_ radiation , i.e. , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , must _RARE_ away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow _RARE_ in size , with a resultant increase in both the _RARE_ effect and the ratio of the _RARE_ force to the _RARE_ force
effect causes the _RARE_ axis of orbits to _RARE_ more rapidly than the _RARE_ axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun
planetary _RARE_ attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the _RARE_ as the sun is approached
_RARE_ unit from the sun ( the _RARE_ distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular
is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be _RARE_ into orbits about the Earth
( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the _RARE_ effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more _RARE_ without changing the _RARE_ axis
can give rise to a blanket of _RARE_ around the Earth
is a _RARE_ loss of _RARE_ material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a _RARE_ _RARE_ : otherwise , _RARE_ would have disappeared from _RARE_ space
several possible sources
Whipple ( 1955 ) , _RARE_ debris is sufficient to _RARE_ the material _RARE_ into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state
are also thought to contribute material
also possible that some of the dust in the _RARE_ of the Earth originated from meteoritic _RARE_ upon the moon
measurements of micrometeorite flux One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space
the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude
discrepancy _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved
few million _RARE_ from the Earth , but still in the region of the _RARE_ orbit , a _RARE_ of the flux of dust is even more _RARE_
distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain
several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment
has been obtained from _RARE_ and _RARE_ equipped with impact sensors
, the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of _RARE_ may be _RARE_ to the micrometeorite _RARE_
brightness of the F component of the solar _RARE_ and the brightness of the _RARE_ light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the _RARE_ plane
source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of _RARE_ dust for a meteoritic component
of _RARE_ _RARE_ and content of _RARE_ in remote regions are valuable in this category
provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth
evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from _RARE_ sensors ( essentially _RARE_ ) and from wire _RARE_ ; ; these instruments are installed on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and space _RARE_
the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 1 ) , 1958 _RARE_ 2 ( _RARE_ 3 ) , and 1959 _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 3 )
, with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure
vehicles with smaller _RARE_ _RARE_ products contribute some information
rate on 1958 _RARE_ for _RARE_ events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( _RARE_ , 1960 ) ; ; this mass threshold was derived from the _RARE_ calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af
show daily and _RARE_ variations
cent of the _RARE_ recorded _RARE_ occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude
conclude that most of the detected _RARE_ material is concentrated in _RARE_ streams which intersect the _RARE_ orbit
been _RARE_ reports from 1958 _RARE_ 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable
15 , a very large increase occurred with Af of mass between Af and Af ; ; for the next two days , the impact rate was Af ; ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than Af ( _RARE_ , 1960 )
for the first day indicate a _RARE_ stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux
from 1959 _RARE_ give an average impact rate of Af for masses larger than Af for about 1000 events in a _RARE_ period ( _RARE_ and Alexander , 1960 )
rate varied by less than a factor of _RARE_
have not yet been analyzed for _RARE_ variations
the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 _RARE_ and that the flux is one fifth as large
_RARE_ that the average flux did not change between measurements , a _RARE_ curve is obtained which _RARE_ the flux of particles larger than a given _RARE_ to the _RARE_ _RARE_ power of the _RARE_
have yielded little information
, recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 _RARE_ in 9 hours
sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few _RARE_ , the second and third Russian space _RARE_ indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones
on so few events , these results are of _RARE_ validity
of _RARE_ sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain
believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation _RARE_ from laboratory results _RARE_ _RARE_ to meteoritic _RARE_
one must expect that _RARE_ and _RARE_ of material by _RARE_ _RARE_ would cause a deviation from a linear relationship
United States , most of the sensors are _RARE_ by dropping small _RARE_ on their sensitive surfaces
_RARE_ claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of _RARE_ material from the _RARE_
_RARE_ '' momentum is _RARE_ related to the particle energy
about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater
a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. _RARE_ are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin
mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the _RARE_ work
mass of about Af _RARE_ to a _RARE_ sphere of density Af
the conversion from mass to size is _RARE_ , since many _RARE_ _RARE_ give evidence of a _RARE_ , loosely bound meteorite structure with _RARE_ as low as Af
extent such low density applies to _RARE_ is unknown
value used is also open to some question ; ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is _RARE_ about the Earth , only about one third the _RARE_ average velocity should be used in _RARE_ the mass
and the _RARE_ give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before _RARE_ is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible _RARE_
variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the _RARE_ sensitivity on the incident velocity
of _RARE_ in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by _RARE_ from radar and visual _RARE_ data
of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of _RARE_ , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table _RARE_
estimated mass of 25 _RARE_ for a _RARE_ meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of _RARE_ for each unit increase in magnitude
is calculated from the mass by assuming _RARE_ of density Af except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of _RARE_ pressure
values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual _RARE_
assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of _RARE_ per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant
agree with the data from 1958 _RARE_ and 1959 _RARE_
in the _RARE_ column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent _RARE_ by the Earth ; ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the _RARE_ atmosphere
flux is given in the last column ; ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in _RARE_ space near the Earth
, if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the _RARE_ in _RARE_ space should be less than the figures given here
the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; ; for example , _RARE_ ( 1948 ) derived a scale of _RARE_ _RARE_ for a Af , _RARE_ meteorite
_RARE_ were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light
scale used in Table _RARE_ was derived on the assumption that the motion of the _RARE_ trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , _RARE_ the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 )
distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the _RARE_ magnitude ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1959 )
this relationship through the _RARE_ magnitude covers the range of _RARE_
equation is Af , where N is the number of Af with electron _RARE_ greater than or equal to Af , and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite
N is _RARE_ proportional to the _RARE_ _RARE_ and in fair agreement with the _RARE_ _RARE_ power derived from 1958 _RARE_ and 1959 _RARE_ data
_RARE_ magnitude , Af , and at the _RARE_ magnitude , Af
_RARE_ are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the _RARE_ data and the figures in _RARE_ table
may be in error for several reasons
data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is _RARE_ in the extension into the micrometeorite region
and _RARE_ pressure and the associated _RARE_ effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and _RARE_ the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few _RARE_
it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( _RARE_ , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected

of micrometeorite flux A measure of the total mass _RARE_ of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of _RARE_ _RARE_ and dust collected in remote regions ( _RARE_ , 1960 )
material , by the time it reaches the _RARE_ surface , has been reduced to dust or to _RARE_ of _RARE_ material in its passage through the atmosphere
meteorites , the average _RARE_ content is about _RARE_ per cent
much higher than the _RARE_ content of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass _RARE_
indicate an _RARE_ of about Af tons per year over the entire _RARE_ , or about Af
_RARE_ warfare is the _RARE_ use of living microorganisms or their _RARE_ products for the purpose of _RARE_ or reducing the military effectiveness of man

is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon
reason for this is that it has no _RARE_ effect
period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of _RARE_ even before a _RARE_ effect , render this weapon _RARE_ for _RARE_ encounter
can be an effective fighting machine throughout the _RARE_ period of most infectious diseases
an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities
operational procedure in _RARE_ for an enemy would be to create an _RARE_ or cloud of agent over the target area
has _RARE_ much basic research concerning the behavior of _RARE_ biological materials , the _RARE_ of respiratory _RARE_ , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence
and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied _RARE_ during the past fifteen years
equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to _RARE_ of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics
has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and _RARE_ techniques
the older experimental work on respiratory _RARE_ was accomplished by very artificial procedures
_RARE_ of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an _RARE_ animal is far different from exposure , through natural _RARE_ , to _RARE_ organisms
of particle size in such _RARE_ has been thoroughly demonstrated
anatomical and physiological _RARE_ features of the upper respiratory tract , such as the _RARE_ of the nose and the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and larger _RARE_ , are capable of _RARE_ out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence
particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 _RARE_ in diameter are capable of passing these _RARE_ barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs
is highly _RARE_ to _RARE_
and retention of infectious particles in the _RARE_ amounts almost to an _RARE_ _RARE_
between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1
_RARE_ defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical _RARE_ parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect
, bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air
optimal _RARE_ requirements for various agents when _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface
rise during _RARE_ conditions
, of course , certain times during the _RARE_ daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met
properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with _RARE_ of the respiratory tract , are _RARE_ in defense considerations
the particle the further it will travel _RARE_ before settling out
of such small particles , moreover , _RARE_ through structures in much the same manner as a gas
be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , food stores , _RARE_ , etc.
the _RARE_ , there may be _RARE_ in some food or _RARE_ products , i.e. , in milk for example
consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense
the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials : In the first trial an _RARE_ substance was _RARE_ from a boat _RARE_ some ten miles off shore under _RARE_ selected _RARE_ conditions
_RARE_ in particles of 2 _RARE_ in size were _RARE_
_RARE_ under _RARE_ light which _RARE_ its sampling and assessment
and fifty pounds was _RARE_ while the ship was traveling a distance of _RARE_ miles
describes the results obtained in this trial
traveled a maximum detected distance of some _RARE_ miles
_RARE_ _RARE_ it can be seen that an area of over _RARE_ square miles was covered
could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case
of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a _RARE_ _RARE_
suspension of the _RARE_ of B. _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , generally known as _RARE_ _RARE_ , was _RARE_ using commercially available _RARE_
cloud was produced even though these _RARE_ were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 _RARE_
test , _RARE_ _RARE_ of a suspension , having a count of Af organisms per ml , or a total of approximately Af _RARE_ , was _RARE_
operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , _RARE_ two miles _RARE_ and vertical to an _RARE_ breeze
along a _RARE_ course
was started at _RARE_ p.m. and _RARE_ for 29 minutes
a slight _RARE_ condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per cent relative _RARE_
of sampling stations had been set up on shore
located at the homes of Government employees , in Government _RARE_ , buildings and _RARE_ within the trial area
attempt was made to _RARE_ the vertical _RARE_ of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ floors of a Government office building
were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours
instance , there was a _RARE_ of _RARE_ during the first two hours and a total _RARE_ of _RARE_ for the _RARE_ period , a _RARE_ increase
that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased
be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol
distance _RARE_ was 23 miles from the source
be seen from these _RARE_ _RARE_ , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area _RARE_
quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly _RARE_
in the three levels of the vertical _RARE_ were : Af
not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol
of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory _RARE_ rather than by natural _RARE_ of entry
have been shown to be much more _RARE_ or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to _RARE_ of optimum particle size than by the natural _RARE_
, for example , is several _RARE_ more _RARE_ by this _RARE_ than when given per _RARE_
instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this _RARE_ of exposure , making diagnosis difficult
produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical _RARE_ of `` rabbit fever '' on a finger
would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious
are known to cause frequent _RARE_ among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , etc. , belong in this category
would likely be selected which would possess sufficient _RARE_ and _RARE_ stability to meet realistic minimal _RARE_ requirements
, obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property
connection it should be capable of being _RARE_ without excessive destruction
it should not be so _RARE_ in its growth requirements as to make production on a _RARE_ significant scale _RARE_
would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or _RARE_ induced _RARE_ in a target population
_RARE_ is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be _RARE_
be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid _RARE_ and a _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent
a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made
might choose an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , a chronic disease _RARE_ or one causing a high rate of _RARE_
possible that certain _RARE_ forms may be produced such as _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
also be developed with changes in _RARE_ properties that are of importance in identification
these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management
are , of course , highly _RARE_
not destroy physical structures as is true of high _RARE_
be of _RARE_ importance in considering military objectives
of epidemic disease _RARE_ some discussion
limited effort has been devoted to this problem
those who question the value of _RARE_ have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of _RARE_
point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of _RARE_ , it is unlikely that a planned _RARE_ could be _RARE_
further ( and somewhat _RARE_ ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an _RARE_ of disease
why this approach to _RARE_ defense has not been given major attention
problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target
of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease
example will illustrate this point
assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the _RARE_ agent of epidemic _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) over City A and that a large number of cases of _RARE_ fever resulted _RARE_
was _RARE_ nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy
a _RARE_ for epidemic _RARE_
case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack
done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic
other hand , a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy
expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack
_RARE_ problems are concerned with the possibility of _RARE_ military delivery of biological agents from appropriate _RARE_ devices
be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons
delivery vehicles -- whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided missiles -- should be _RARE_
is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city
are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy _RARE_ which _RARE_ many problems in defense
obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned
_RARE_ and _RARE_ systems of large buildings are subject to attack
rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , _RARE_ and even _RARE_ foods
an enormous industry that is subject to _RARE_
include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products
are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and _RARE_ which are _RARE_ to this type of attack
of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies
_RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and column chromatography on _RARE_ exchange _RARE_
the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators
_RARE_ , using a _RARE_ _RARE_ scheme , _RARE_ whole sera containing _RARE_ and _RARE_ antibodies on _RARE_ _RARE_ cellulose and _RARE_ cellulose
_RARE_ , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of _RARE_ for _RARE_ from Aj
_RARE_ used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ samples
present work whole sera have been _RARE_ by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single _RARE_ similar to those described by _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and certain chemical and _RARE_ properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ systems have been described
methods samples
were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O _RARE_
the _RARE_ sera used were taken from recently _RARE_ individuals
complete antibody and had a _RARE_ of 1 : _RARE_ in saline
contained incomplete antibody and showed _RARE_ of 1 : _RARE_ in albumin and 1 : _RARE_ by the indirect Coombs test
, containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies , had _RARE_ of 1 : _RARE_ in saline , 1 : _RARE_ in albumin and 1 : _RARE_ by the indirect Coombs test
one serum was obtained from a _RARE_ ( R. E. ) who had been _RARE_ 6 years previously
_RARE_ _RARE_ of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : _RARE_ by the indirect Coombs test
_RARE_ were determined by reaction with _RARE_ Af red cells

_RARE_ activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O _RARE_ by the following tube _RARE_ methods
of each sample was added to one drop of a _RARE_ suspension of group Af or group B red cells in a small Af test tube
instances group O cells were also used as controls
cells were used within 2 days after _RARE_ and were washed with large amounts of saline before use
of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 Aj
were then centrifuged at 1000 _RARE_ for 1 _RARE_ and examined _RARE_ for _RARE_
albumin method , equal volumes of _RARE_ _RARE_ albumin , sample and _RARE_ cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 _RARE_ for 1 Aj
were tested by both the saline and albumin methods
of fractions of sera containing _RARE_ antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques
_RARE_ Af cells , Af and _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af cells were used to test each sample ; ; however , in the interest of clarity and _RARE_ only the results obtained with _RARE_ Af and _RARE_ Af cells will be presented here
and albumin tests were performed as described for the _RARE_ samples except that the mixture was _RARE_ for 1 hr at _RARE_ before _RARE_
tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner
were washed three times with saline , _RARE_ serum was added , the cells were _RARE_ , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 _RARE_ for 1 _RARE_ and examined for _RARE_
sera used were prepared by _RARE_ whole human serum into _RARE_
shown by _RARE_ to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for use in the present study
cells for the _RARE_ antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the Af cells , which had been _RARE_ and stored at _RARE_ for approximately 1 year
were _RARE_ at _RARE_ for 30 _RARE_ and were _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ and mixing with _RARE_ concentrations of _RARE_ solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and _RARE_ )
were then washed three times with saline and _RARE_ to _RARE_ in saline

were allowed to _RARE_ at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed
was measured _RARE_ and subsequently _RARE_ in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes , approximately _RARE_ ml each , of `` starting buffer ''
, pH _RARE_ , was _RARE_ M in Af and _RARE_ M in _RARE_ ( _RARE_ )
the sample was centrifuged and the _RARE_ placed on a Af cm column of _RARE_ _RARE_ with starting buffer
, containing _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - _RARE_ _RARE_
amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer , centrifuged , _RARE_ in _RARE_ ml of _RARE_ saline and tested for antibody activity
was done at _RARE_ using gradient _RARE_ , essentially according to _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a _RARE_ gradient _RARE_ device ( `` _RARE_ '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere
, a _RARE_ _RARE_ gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` _RARE_ '' apparatus , the `` _RARE_ '' being a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and the `` sphere , '' a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
contained _RARE_ ml of buffer ; ; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the _RARE_ was final buffer , _RARE_ M in both Af and _RARE_ , pH _RARE_
rate of _RARE_ Af was used and 12 ml fractions were collected
fractions were obtained from each column
read at _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ model _RARE_ _RARE_ and tested for antibody activity as described above

identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by _RARE_ against a stream of air at _RARE_ or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted _RARE_ concentration of the protein and dialysis against _RARE_ saline
latter procedure the temperature was maintained at _RARE_ by surrounding the apparatus with ice
pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very _RARE_ solutions and was a _RARE_ procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments
was carried out on the concentrated samples in a _RARE_ model R cell using _RARE_ buffer , pH _RARE_ , _RARE_ strength _RARE_ , at room temperature on _RARE_ _RARE_ filter paper
were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with _RARE_ blue and _RARE_ was carried out using a _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a _RARE_ fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were _RARE_ under the conditions described above
end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each _RARE_ were dried , stained for 1 hr , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a _RARE_ position at _RARE_
strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut _RARE_ so as to separate the various protein bands
sections containing a given protein were _RARE_ , _RARE_ with _RARE_ ml of _RARE_ saline , and the _RARE_ were tested for antibody activity

the column which were to be subjected to _RARE_ _RARE_ were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and _RARE_ for 16 hr in the cold against at least _RARE_ volumes of _RARE_ saline , pH _RARE_ , _RARE_ strength _RARE_
then centrifuged at _RARE_ _RARE_ for 35 to 80 _RARE_ at _RARE_ in a _RARE_ model E _RARE_ at a protein concentration of _RARE_ to _RARE_
were computed as Af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the _RARE_ patterns
_RARE_ , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and _RARE_ to 12 ml with _RARE_ saline
then carried out in a _RARE_ model L _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ , refrigeration being used throughout the run
fractions were then drawn off with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity
will be described below
results The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood group of the _RARE_
of the _RARE_ described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated _RARE_ of the _RARE_ series into at least three regions ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity
been labeled _RARE_ 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1
early part of the gradient was _RARE_ , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` _RARE_ '' gradient to become established more slowly , _RARE_ 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( _RARE_ P. J. and R. S. , Fig. 1 and E. M. , Fig. 2 )
procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) between _RARE_ 1 and 2
of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( _RARE_ 3 , Fig. 1 )
after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ P. J. , D. A. , and J. F. , Fig. 1 )
these regions _RARE_ equal _RARE_ activity , as evidenced by _RARE_ and the extent of the active areas
cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity
particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in _RARE_ 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all
to be no difference in the distribution of _RARE_ and _RARE_ activity in group O serum , though in two group O _RARE_ ( J. F. and E. M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 )
of _RARE_ plasma were _RARE_ in our laboratory by _RARE_ 6 of _RARE_ et al
were tested for _RARE_ agglutinin activity , using fractions from group _RARE_ plasma as a control
, most of the activity was found in _RARE_ Af , with slight activity seen in _RARE_ _RARE_
of _RARE_ Af from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , _RARE_ against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2
, both _RARE_ and _RARE_ activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis
both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , having extremely low , low , and high anionic binding capacity , respectively ( Fig. 3 )
whole sera revealed that the areas of _RARE_ antibody activity were generally continuous and wide
antibody activity appeared in the early part of the _RARE_ ; ; the complete , in the latter part
containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 )
cases the activity against Af cells was spread over a wider area than that with Af cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison
material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity
_RARE_ of Af cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity
later known to be the result of _RARE_ the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; ; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected
the _RARE_ , practically all bees and bumblebees _RARE_ in a state of _RARE_
you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over _RARE_ in your garden , but you have to be a really keen _RARE_ to see them at all
their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often _RARE_ _RARE_ you may very well mistake them for _RARE_ of dirt
add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have _RARE_ in the previous summer or autumn
on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , brothers , and _RARE_ sisters ) have _RARE_ with the arrival of the cold weather
of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling _RARE_ to enemies or disease
emerge on some nice , _RARE_ day in March or April , when the temperature is close to _RARE_ and there is not too much wind
thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful _RARE_ _RARE_ such as the red _RARE_ _RARE_ of our Pacific _RARE_ , or otherwise a good _RARE_ tree , or perhaps some nice _RARE_ willow in _RARE_ , preferably one with male or _RARE_ _RARE_
of _RARE_ and of the willow and _RARE_ are the places where large numbers of our early insects will _RARE_ : _RARE_ , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of _RARE_
a happy , _RARE_ crowd
willow _RARE_ is composed of a large number of small flowers
not difficult to see that the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , _RARE_ little scale
the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny _RARE_
the _RARE_ or honey _RARE_ ( Fig. 26 , page _RARE_ )
willow _RARE_ , then , provide their visitors with both _RARE_ and pollen ; ; a _RARE_ arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed
exception to this is certain bees that have become _RARE_
deal with these later on
, _RARE_ form a majority on the willow _RARE_
have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , _RARE_ , and much more _RARE_ than _RARE_ , _RARE_ various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange
not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them _RARE_
be several dozen species in the United States alone
really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North American species is _RARE_ And Their _RARE_ by O. E. _RARE_
manage to keep track of a _RARE_ queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the _RARE_ little _RARE_ which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep
a queen , a _RARE_ female is rather _RARE_ and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable _RARE_ place
seem to prefer a _RARE_ hollow such as a deserted mouse nest , a bird house , or the hole made by a _RARE_ ; ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in _RARE_
has made up her mind , the queen starts out by _RARE_ , in her chosen _RARE_ , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some _RARE_ material
, she _RARE_ an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous _RARE_ mixture called beebread
_RARE_ one or two _RARE_ cups which she _RARE_ with honey
a group of eggs is deposited in a _RARE_ in the beebread _RARE_ and the egg compartment is closed
afterward keeps _RARE_ and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a _RARE_ from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey _RARE_
larvae _RARE_ , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother
to add to the pollen supply as needed
, kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days
makes a tough , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
two weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small _RARE_ that begin to play the role of worker bees , collecting pollen and _RARE_ in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen _RARE_ to a life of egg _RARE_
worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; ; males and _RARE_ females do not emerge until later in the season
of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed
middle of the summer , many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear
males or _RARE_ are produced , mostly from the _RARE_ eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen
queens and _RARE_ leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the _RARE_ young queens will begin to dig in for the winter
an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing , for instance , in August
then is still very high
old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the _RARE_ eggs that will produce females
result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old _RARE_ will die out completely
itself , the structure that in some cases _RARE_ about _RARE_ individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the _RARE_ larvae of certain _RARE_ and _RARE_
, though , does the development of a _RARE_ _RARE_ take place in the smooth fashion we have just described
of the bee family have become _RARE_ , social _RARE_ that live at the expense of their _RARE_ relatives
thus suffer severely from the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , the `` _RARE_ '' as it is called in some European countries
of _RARE_ look _RARE_ like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they _RARE_
sure way to tell _RARE_ and _RARE_ apart is to examine the _RARE_ legs which in the case of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , lack the pollen _RARE_ -- naturally
_RARE_ _RARE_ much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host
_RARE_ , she usually _RARE_ to slip in _RARE_ , to _RARE_ an egg on a completed _RARE_ of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment
never seem to recognize that something is _RARE_ , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally
the larvae of the _RARE_ can develop at the expense of the _RARE_ inhabitants and the store of beebread
, they and the mother _RARE_ are fed by the _RARE_ workers
, in a number of cases it has been claimed that the _RARE_ female _RARE_ the _RARE_ queen
us return , after this _RARE_ _RARE_ , to our willow _RARE_ in the spring ; ; there are other wild bees that command our attention
almost certain that some of these , usually a trifle smaller than the _RARE_ , are _RARE_ or mining bees
about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone
my _RARE_ is A. _RARE_ , a species very common in England , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee
like to _RARE_ in the short _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , where their little _RARE_ of earth often appear by the hundreds
in size to a _RARE_ , A. _RARE_ is much more beautiful in color , at least in the female of the species : a rich , _RARE_ , _RARE_ red
are much _RARE_
_RARE_ , an Andrena female _RARE_ a hole straight down into the ground , forming a _RARE_ about the size of a lead pencil
part of a _RARE_ has a number of side _RARE_ or `` cells '' , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread
of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already _RARE_ and become adults
are still enclosed in their _RARE_ cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter
, next spring , _RARE_ in an almost _RARE_ way with the _RARE_ of their host plants
_RARE_ valley in California , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and the opening of the willow _RARE_
be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal
male and female _RARE_ have _RARE_ , the cycle is repeated
is _RARE_ , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of _RARE_ together , we must still call it a solitary bee
history is much _RARE_ than that of the truly _RARE_ bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species
, social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature
basis of its life history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees
in which it _RARE_ its pollen is not so perfect , either
pollen _RARE_ and _RARE_ only a large number of long , _RARE_ hairs on its legs , on which the pollen _RARE_ will collect
will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down _RARE_ in the wind
to the _RARE_ are the _RARE_ or _RARE_ bees
can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great _RARE_ , for example , in _RARE_ and central Washington
United States Department of _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George E. _RARE_ _RARE_ a site in _RARE_ which was estimated to contain _RARE_ _RARE_ females
_RARE_ are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres
history of the _RARE_ bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals _RARE_ in the _RARE_ stage
places , there are two generations a year , a second brood of adults _RARE_ late in the summer
_RARE_ guilty to a special sympathy for _RARE_
just be pride in my adopted State of Washington , but certainly I love to visit their _RARE_ cities near _RARE_ and _RARE_ in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period
`` _RARE_ bee '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather _RARE_ places
although by no means always , these are indeed _RARE_
is that these bees love a _RARE_ soil that is moist ; ; yet the water in the ground should not be _RARE_ either
dense _RARE_
one find such conditions
chance , of course , is offered by gently _RARE_ _RARE_ where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high _RARE_ leaves _RARE_ _RARE_ which permit only _RARE_ plant growth
( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length
_RARE_ put length at maturity at two _RARE_ the ultimate length for some _RARE_ , and Charles C. _RARE_ data on _RARE_ _RARE_ and ribbon snakes ( _RARE_ ) show that the smallest _RARE_ females are more than half as long as the _RARE_ adults
states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its _RARE_ length '' , but goes on to _RARE_ the _RARE_ python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity
hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow _RARE_ after _RARE_ maturity ; ; he was working with species of _RARE_ , so perhaps some _RARE_ snakes are unusual in this respect
giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to _RARE_ conditions
of slow growth have been omitted
possible to make a few _RARE_ about the six giants themselves
to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda )
the former are _RARE_ , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby _RARE_ support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length
of the six ( the anaconda and the _RARE_ python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage
speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda
in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a _RARE_ of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet
comes to rate of early growth , the Indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years , more or less
rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the _RARE_ python
few data on the boa constrictor , those for the anaconda are _RARE_ , and there is nothing at all on the _RARE_ python
likely that the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; ; it _RARE_ _RARE_ well to _RARE_ and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep
make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet
records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to _RARE_ from drawing conclusions
often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an _RARE_
way to determine the correct figure ( in _RARE_ ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : _RARE_ of a male Indian python in less than two years , his mate in less than three ; ; data on the boa constrictor about match this
is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity
this approach _RARE_ confirm the direct observations : about three years are required , there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required
_RARE_ python and the anaconda must be _RARE_ for lack or _RARE_ of data
information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a _RARE_ maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature
in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States , could supply data on the _RARE_ period for only three species in addition to the _RARE_ , which I shall consider separately
were much _RARE_ : lined snake ( _RARE_ ) , one year and nine months ; ; _RARE_ snake ( _RARE_ ) , two years ; ; _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , two years
the _RARE_ carefully himself and also summarized what others have found
that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three
have _RARE_ that in the northern United States the _RARE_ _RARE_ may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be born every other year , rather than _RARE_
showed that female common _RARE_ and ribbon snakes of _RARE_ mature at about the age of two
_RARE_ _RARE_ are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to _RARE_ dimensions
_RARE_ are of little value ; ; every snake hide is _RARE_ longer than its _RARE_ and _RARE_ stretching presents no difficulty to the _RARE_ _RARE_
of all the _RARE_ , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants
_RARE_ to be the fly in the _RARE_ , but the reason for this is not clear ; ; the relatively wild conditions still found in _RARE_ South America might be responsible
three levels on which to treat the subject
is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may _RARE_ on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh
_RARE_ virtually all field measurements
level attempts to _RARE_ varied evidence and come to a balanced , _RARE_ conclusion ; ; field measurements by experienced _RARE_ are not rejected , and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated
level _RARE_ on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire
against this last approach is comparable to that which _RARE_ stories about _RARE_ snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of _RARE_ that _RARE_ people out of _RARE_ ; ; the mere _RARE_ up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of _RARE_ snakes , joint snakes , or _RARE_
recently used the _RARE_ approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions : the anaconda reaches a length of at least _RARE_ feet , the _RARE_ python _RARE_ , the African rock python 25 , the _RARE_ python at least 22 , the Indian python 20 , and the boa constrictor _RARE_
also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda
that as _RARE_ 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous _RARE_ '' over 50
dimensions of 70 feet and more
chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge _RARE_ with _RARE_ strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed
on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows
the six giants _RARE_ of the giants one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; ; time required to reach maturity ; ; rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; ; and maximum length , with _RARE_ or _RARE_ of _RARE_ figures
on the growth of _RARE_ individuals is _RARE_
At birth , this species varies considerably in size
of _RARE_ born at _RARE_ _RARE_ , near Chicago , ranged in length from 22 to _RARE_ inches and averaged 29 inches
_RARE_ gives measurements of nineteen young _RARE_ , presumably members of a brood , from `` South America '' ; ; the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the _RARE_ brood and its average
_RARE_ had two _RARE_ that averaged _RARE_ inches
_RARE_ and F. W. _RARE_ give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the _RARE_ _RARE_
reports 26 inches and _RARE_ _RARE_ ( this snake must have been _RARE_ ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British _RARE_
, _RARE_ recorded the average length of _RARE_ young of a _RARE_ female as 38 inches , and four young were born in London at a length of 35 or _RARE_ inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 _RARE_
a _RARE_ anaconda that weighed only _RARE_ _RARE_
between _RARE_ might explain the great range in size
little information on the _RARE_ rate of growth
had one that increased from _RARE_ inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J. J. _RARE_ records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years
very unlikely that either of these _RARE_ was growing at a normal rate
, _RARE_ Do _RARE_ , the noted _RARE_ _RARE_ , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes
that the _RARE_ maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) _RARE_ , which would approximate from _RARE_ to 42 feet ( 14 _RARE_ is slightly less than _RARE_ feet )
his estimate lies between _RARE_ suggestion of at least _RARE_ feet and the _RARE_ `` monstrous _RARE_ '' _RARE_ by _RARE_
_RARE_ recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Company , and reported in 1944 by _RARE_ R. _RARE_
as a field measurement , it is open to question
feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable
many _RARE_ remain _RARE_ and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet
possible that especially large _RARE_ will prove to belong to _RARE_ limited to a small area
difference in size is a common characteristic of _RARE_
: A _RARE_ _RARE_ brood of sixteen boa _RARE_ born in the _RARE_ Island _RARE_ averaged 20 inches
length seems to be typical
_RARE_ records of newly and recently born individuals are _RARE_ , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected
is from 14 to 25 inches ; ; the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central American female ( see chapter on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual
as so many of the records are not certainly based on _RARE_ snakes , these data must be taken _RARE_ ; ; final conclusions will have to _RARE_ the measurements of _RARE_ from definite _RARE_
_RARE_ measurements of several very young specimens from _RARE_ suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male
surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity
has written to me of sexual activity in February _RARE_ of young born in March _RARE_
, collected on an island off the coast of _RARE_ , was _RARE_ and measured 4 feet 8 inches from _RARE_ to _RARE_ ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long )
from Central America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long
there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; ; _RARE_ , no one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period of time
are too varied to allow _RARE_
and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout
vein , however , without the _RARE_ supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the _RARE_ and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 )
difference is noted here
artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory _RARE_ , the alveolar _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 )
artery , except for a small number of short branches in the _RARE_ , contributes none of the pleural blood supply
, as in type 1 , , supply the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the _RARE_ , and the bronchioles -- _RARE_ in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory _RARE_
_RARE_ artery anastomoses were noted in this group
3 ( ( fig. 3 ) is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2
characterized by the presence of _RARE_ developed secondary _RARE_ ; ; well defined , but _RARE_ arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably _RARE_ pleura ( fig. 9 )
distal _RARE_ are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles ( figs. 14 , 15 )
instance , because of incomplete _RARE_ , the secondary _RARE_ does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1
one area to another are , therefore , _RARE_
_RARE_ is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 ( ( fig. 24 )
, however , is not maintained _RARE_
pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the _RARE_ , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the _RARE_ ( figs. 23 , 24 )
artery in its course and distribution _RARE_ somewhat from that found in other _RARE_
in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ to the pulmonary artery and vein , the _RARE_ and the terminal bronchioles
type 1 , , it provides _RARE_ blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich _RARE_ pleural supply is seen ( figs. 9 , 10 )
supply is derived both from _RARE_ and interlobular bronchial artery branches
_RARE_ _RARE_ was _RARE_ demonstrated during the _RARE_ process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once
these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct _RARE_ branches following along the pleural surface
of filling , _RARE_ anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches
increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted
_RARE_ for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery
of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere _RARE_ _RARE_ ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 )
regions its diameter would be _RARE_ to _RARE_ that of the pulmonary artery
could be followed to the _RARE_ where it directly provided bronchial _RARE_ blood to the alveolar capillary bed ( figs. 17 , 18 )
other direct _RARE_ of alveolar bronchial _RARE_ supply were noted : via the pleura ; ; through the interlobular septa ; ; and along the terminal _RARE_ ( figs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 )
_RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ was noted at the terminal _RARE_ level ( fig. 26 )
is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an _RARE_ comparison is made
of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding _RARE_ differences been determined
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , from _RARE_ considerations alone , may _RARE_ be different in the monkey than in the horse
and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial _RARE_ blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse
interlobular air _RARE_ may be all but _RARE_ in the cow ; ; probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ; and , in contrast , are present to a relatively _RARE_ degree on a _RARE_ basis in the dog where _RARE_ are absent ( _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ )
for such wide variation in the pulmonary _RARE_ is entirely _RARE_ at present
wide limits anatomy _RARE_ function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well
, the marked _RARE_ of the monkey to respiratory _RARE_ might be related to its delicate , long alveolar _RARE_ and short , large bronchioles situated within a _RARE_ entirely _RARE_ in _RARE_ supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 , and 3
also wonder if _RARE_ are capable of developing _RARE_ as we know it in man or the horse
, it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized _RARE_ occurring in a cow , considering its marked _RARE_ development but , _RARE_ , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog
the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , _RARE_ as this can be _RARE_ from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) in the human being
area in which one might find major _RARE_ in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries
as _RARE_ , _RARE_ Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings
, this was _RARE_ by _RARE_
to this point of view has its _RARE_ support in the work of Miller ( _RARE_ )
however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been _RARE_ for using _RARE_ human material in his normal study ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ )
noted in _RARE_ that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the _RARE_ features of various _RARE_ lungs other than in the dog and cat ( Miller , _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ )
of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear
this artery is known to be a _RARE_ vessel with a distribution primarily to the _RARE_ _RARE_ and supportive tissues of the lung
and respiratory bronchioles are primarily _RARE_ tissues
they are capable of _RARE_ their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) or from pulmonary _RARE_ blood ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ )
an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the _RARE_ requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily _RARE_ in nature , in the region of the _RARE_
be true , the possibility exists that an _RARE_ _RARE_ of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread _RARE_ of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized _RARE_
not expect such an event to occur in animals _RARE_ lungs of types 1 , or 2
of normally occurring bronchial _RARE_ artery anastomoses was first noted in _RARE_ by _RARE_ , and thereafter by many others
_RARE_ ) , _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and Watson ( _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) have all claimed their normal but relatively _RARE_ existence in the human being
_RARE_ ) is the principal _RARE_ of this _RARE_
of the _RARE_ views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung _RARE_ studies in which all of the _RARE_ channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were _RARE_ with various _RARE_ colored particles designed to stop at the _RARE_ level
as _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ demonstrated with _RARE_ studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure
_RARE_ and _RARE_ in 1931 and _RARE_ in 1958 _RARE_ this
studies in which bronchial _RARE_ artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by _RARE_ the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by _RARE_ the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards
distinctly possible , therefore , that _RARE_ pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the _RARE_ _RARE_ and hence , _RARE_
is further supported by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) demonstration of _RARE_ bronchial artery and _RARE_ muscular coats which are capable of acting as _RARE_
words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand _RARE_
, little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial _RARE_ artery anastomoses
_RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ ) found these _RARE_ in the human being but was unable to find them in _RARE_
_RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) also were unable to find them in _RARE_
_RARE_ ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by _RARE_ or _RARE_ methods , in dogs
that the absence or presence of these _RARE_ is _RARE_ is therefore _RARE_
the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species
, however , highly _RARE_ and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial _RARE_ artery _RARE_ in certain species , especially the dog
, these findings suggest the need for a comparative _RARE_ , pathology , and _RARE_ of _RARE_ lungs
, a detailed _RARE_ survey of the _RARE_ of generalized pulmonary _RARE_ in _RARE_ would be interesting and pertinent
for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man
especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man
it is suggested that in many _RARE_ the horse lung may be _RARE_ more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species
main _RARE_ anatomical features of the lungs of various _RARE_ are presented
of these features permits the lungs to be _RARE_ into three _RARE_ _RARE_ types
, is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; ; type 3 , , by the horse
extremely well developed in type 1 ; ; absent in type 2 ; ; _RARE_ developed in type 3
and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 and 3
is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent
to the pleura in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type 2 , by the pulmonary artery
1 , 2 and 3 the bronchial artery _RARE_ in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal _RARE_
3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed
bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal _RARE_ in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present
respiratory bronchioles , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal _RARE_ in type 2
1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the _RARE_ and the pulmonary artery from the _RARE_ to the _RARE_
be due to the heavy interlobular _RARE_ tissue barriers present
3 , this general relationship is maintained _RARE_ but not _RARE_ where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the _RARE_ as is the case throughout the lung in type 2
the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1
the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls
, 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are _RARE_ and extend over a much _RARE_ period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls
_RARE_ for each sex _RARE_ clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of _RARE_ and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of _RARE_
for both _RARE_ , the 21 _RARE_ lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile
standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to _RARE_ early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed _RARE_
the process of _RARE_ is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which _RARE_ data for other groups of children
Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children
convenient to _RARE_ a child's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( _RARE_ ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short _RARE_ line
dot appears close to the end of the _RARE_ line , the `` moderate '' _RARE_ may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical _RARE_ _RARE_ the mean age
may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , _RARE_ `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean
lower portion of each _RARE_ , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified
middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the _RARE_ _RARE_ boys and girls
curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean _RARE_ one standard deviation
a child's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve
the purpose of the Skeletal _RARE_ _RARE_ : each contains two kinds of _RARE_ maturity norms which show two quite different methods of _RARE_ _RARE_ level of growth centers
the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting of those from Hand , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
portion _RARE_ only films of Hand
the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions
portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones _RARE_ , since only two long bones are included in Hand and _RARE_ as a region
the upper portion deals with only two indicators of _RARE_ level , Onset and Completion
portion _RARE_ the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion
the two indicators are for the most part widely separated _RARE_ , with the extensive age _RARE_ occurring during childhood for all but one growth center
portion provides a _RARE_ at any stage between _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile
be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body
maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the _RARE_ , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age _RARE_ are dependent upon _RARE_ during _RARE_ and upon _RARE_ during _RARE_
clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement
Skeletal Age _RARE_ can be made at any age during growth , from _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of _RARE_ _RARE_ progress during childhood
earlier in the paper , _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- particularly the former -- provide a different tool or indicator of _RARE_ in _RARE_ development , each within a limited age period
indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of _RARE_ specific periods of delay in _RARE_ _RARE_ progress
stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of _RARE_ of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2
approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2
between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into _RARE_ by means of a series of arrows
for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4
system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers
dot '' on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center
tip '' of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center
the _RARE_ of the `` dots '' and `` tips '' , respectively , indicate individual _RARE_ of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls
in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset
`` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` Same schedule ''
of the arrow indicates amount of _RARE_ or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables
between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ sequence in Figures 3 and 4
is readily _RARE_ by referring to Table 1
, arrow 17 in Figure 3 _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ for boy 34 , whereas the same _RARE_ for girl 2 is _RARE_ by arrow 18 in Figure 4
boy , this _RARE_ was _RARE_ delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion
the _RARE_ of its ossification was _RARE_ and the _RARE_ ability to `` catch up '' in ossification is demonstrated
, for the girl the _RARE_ was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion
the _RARE_ for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion
Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that _RARE_ may have occurred for her during the _RARE_ period
the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in Table 1
attempted to simplify the extensive task of _RARE_ onset ages and completion ages of each child -- more than _RARE_ values for the entire group -- by _RARE_ figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center
and 6 are examples of our method of _RARE_ the results for each growth center
figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this _RARE_ have been included in the Appendix
used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix
center in a short bone -- distal _RARE_ of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because _RARE_ fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the _RARE_ and for boys near their comparable _RARE_ stage
thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , _RARE_ patterns , and health during _RARE_
summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of _RARE_ the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center
top of Figure 5 , for example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in Table 1
arrows , _RARE_ onset age plus completion age _RARE_ , have been _RARE_ in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls
center _RARE_ here , in the distal _RARE_ of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones
onset age was _RARE_ months ( Table 1 ) , and the average _RARE_ of the _RARE_ stage was _RARE_ months
( Table 2 ) between onset age and completion age was _RARE_ , and that between onset age and _RARE_ was _RARE_
consideration for the limits of precision in assessing , expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the _RARE_ , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four months or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion , for this particular _RARE_
girls 31 , 29 , _RARE_ , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , _RARE_ , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion
clear , from the _RARE_ shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late _RARE_ and _RARE_ for the 34 girls
if _RARE_ fusion occurs in this _RARE_ near _RARE_ , early and late _RARE_ might have been _RARE_ rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule ''
example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which _RARE_ four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion
of interest that her _RARE_ was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group
analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would _RARE_ quite a different conclusion about the _RARE_ value of onset age in forecasting their _RARE_ of the _RARE_ stage
, 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; ; thus early forecasting of the _RARE_ stage would appear possible for only seven boys
, like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; ; his arrow _RARE_ the line _RARE_ the mean
dot '' on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip '' indicates relatively later Completion
42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6 , _RARE_ of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them
, the effect of the _RARE_ _RARE_ is _RARE_ by a high concentration of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ medium and is _RARE_ by the absence of _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , 1960 )

iodine The precise mechanism for _RARE_ of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood
the formation of _RARE_ bound iodine , mainly _RARE_ , can be accomplished in _RARE_ systems
absence of _RARE_ to the _RARE_ , the product formed is an iodinated _RARE_ protein ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1953 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1955 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , 1956 ; ; _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1958 ; ; De _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1960 )
does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in _RARE_ by _RARE_ systems
, the _RARE_ acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is _RARE_
and a system generating hydrogen _RARE_ are added to a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the thyroid , large quantities of free _RARE_ can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 )
not clear whether this system bears any _RARE_ to the in _RARE_ _RARE_ mechanism , and a system generating _RARE_ has not been identified in thyroid tissue
grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first _RARE_ to Af and then to Af as the active _RARE_ species
thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free _RARE_ and _RARE_ are not iodinated
_RARE_ , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone
and _RARE_ must be coupled to form _RARE_ and thyroxine
of this coupling has been studied in some detail with _RARE_ systems in _RARE_ and can be simulated by certain _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and James , 1958 )
so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under _RARE_ control
nature of the _RARE_ is discussed below ( _RARE_ _RARE_ et _RARE_ )

Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin
has not been demonstrated in _RARE_ systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in _RARE_ been _RARE_ _RARE_
some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may _RARE_ independently of _RARE_ , for in certain _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in _RARE_ experiments ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1959 )
have been noted in a patient with _RARE_ absence of the _RARE_ enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide
, depending on availability of _RARE_ iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine

the _RARE_ thyroid _RARE_ are the _RARE_ _RARE_ thyroxine and _RARE_ ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before _RARE_
of several _RARE_ and _RARE_ has been demonstrated in the thyroid
the _RARE_ has pH optimum of about _RARE_ and another of about _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , Stanley and _RARE_ , 1954 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1955 )
that the concentration of one of these _RARE_ is increased in thyroid _RARE_ from _RARE_ animals suggests that this _RARE_ may be active in _RARE_
no conclusive evidence yet that either of the _RARE_ has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known
of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not _RARE_ released and that the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with the formation of _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1956 )
enzymes the thyroid _RARE_ _RARE_ enzymes
_RARE_ with a pH optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced _RARE_ _RARE_ for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( _RARE_ , 1957 )
_RARE_ is effective against _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but does not _RARE_ thyroxine or _RARE_
assumed that the iodine released from the _RARE_ remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is _RARE_ and _RARE_ into thyroglobulin
and _RARE_ released by _RARE_ and so _RARE_ _RARE_ presumably _RARE_ into the blood stream
been shown that thyroglobulin _RARE_ thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong
been suggested that the plasma _RARE_ proteins , which have an extremely high _RARE_ for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1957 )

_RARE_ drugs are of two general types
has a small _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ type
_RARE_ thyroid hormone synthesis by _RARE_ with iodide concentration in the thyroid
not appear to affect the _RARE_ mechanism as such
group of _RARE_ agents or drugs is _RARE_ by _RARE_
have no effect on the iodide _RARE_ mechanism , but they inhibit _RARE_
of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the _RARE_ form of iodine before it can _RARE_ thyroglobulin ( _RARE_ , 1954 )
other hand , there are a few _RARE_ drugs of this same general type , such as _RARE_ , _RARE_ no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine
the _RARE_ drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause _RARE_ , _RARE_ to _RARE_ of thyroid hormone synthesis , with production of _RARE_
_RARE_ of the pituitary then _RARE_ by an increased output of TSH , causing the thyroid to _RARE_
of drugs that act on the _RARE_ mechanism can be _RARE_ by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet
drugs of the _RARE_ type , however , are not _RARE_ by such means
of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ types , certain _RARE_ drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods
conclusively identified is _RARE_ , which was isolated from _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ )
presumed to occur in other members of the _RARE_ family
some evidence that naturally occurring _RARE_ may play a role in the development of _RARE_ , particularly in _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1956 )
seems that the _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ animals is itself _RARE_ but is _RARE_ in the animal to an active _RARE_ , which is then _RARE_ in the milk

Besides the presence of _RARE_ in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland
experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in _RARE_ iodine causes thyroid _RARE_ , _RARE_ and increased thyroid activity ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1952 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ , 1954 )
the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of _RARE_ is about 100 _RARE_ per day
levels , thyroid _RARE_ and increased thyroid _RARE_ enable the thyroid to _RARE_ a larger proportion of the daily _RARE_ of iodine
the gland is able to _RARE_ a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone _RARE_ _RARE_
presence of a low iodine _RARE_ , thyroglobulin _RARE_ in _RARE_ with Af is found to contain more _RARE_ than normal , the amounts of _RARE_ and _RARE_ being _RARE_ reduced
to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid _RARE_ of newly iodinated thyroglobulin
deficiency _RARE_ long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the Af label will reflect the Af distribution in the thyroglobulin
might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide _RARE_ , or _RARE_ , or _RARE_ thyroglobulin _RARE_

hormone The name _RARE_ hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the _RARE_ pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence
has also been called _RARE_ or _RARE_ hormone
present time we do not know by what _RARE_ mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for _RARE_ of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the _RARE_ cells and increase in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of Af
shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood
1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of _RARE_ TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject

and physical properties of pituitary _RARE_ As long ago as _RARE_ it was pointed out by _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid
was _RARE_ by Smith and Smith ( _RARE_ ) , who showed that saline _RARE_ of fresh _RARE_ pituitary _RARE_ could _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_
attempts to _RARE_ TSH came a decade later , when _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1931 ) used _RARE_ acid to separate the _RARE_ TSH from insoluble impurities
work other investigators applied _RARE_ techniques to the problem , as well as _RARE_ with organic _RARE_ , such as _RARE_
1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period , from 1931 to _RARE_ , were probably about 100 to 300 times as _RARE_ as the starting material
this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 )
to about 1957 have been discussed by _RARE_ ( 1958 )
last few years , the application of _RARE_ and other modern techniques to the problem of _RARE_ TSH has led to further _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1960 ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1960 )
active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in _RARE_ , composition and physical properties
present themselves in considering any hormone in blood
is the _RARE_ form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is _RARE_ and stored
what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration _RARE_ from the normal level and in which direction
therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the _RARE_ chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed _RARE_
of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is _RARE_ by the recent observation that there exists an _RARE_ _RARE_ TSH in blood drawn from many _RARE_ patients ( Adams , 1958 )
_RARE_ TSH _RARE_ _RARE_ from pituitary TSH , or is , _RARE_ , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood _RARE_ , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary Aj
data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine _RARE_ the _RARE_ methods used to obtain them
of the United States _RARE_ reference standard in 1952 and the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and international units of _RARE_ activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time
like to _RARE_ the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the _RARE_ of biological units
most part , this discussion will be _RARE_ to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard

and units of _RARE_ activity The international unit ( _RARE_ ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in _RARE_ mg of the International Standard Preparation
unit is _RARE_ with the _RARE_ unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the _RARE_ reference substance
weakness is now recognized as an _RARE_ though serious _RARE_ of _RARE_ therapy , with most of the synthetic _RARE_ _RARE_ in clinical use
have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of _RARE_ weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which _RARE_ _RARE_ the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups
described in this paper is that of an older man who developed _RARE_ muscular weakness while receiving a variety of _RARE_ for a _RARE_ _RARE_
case This patient was a _RARE_ white male _RARE_ who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of _RARE_ weakness and general _RARE_
the patient developed an _RARE_ _RARE_ for which 15 blood _RARE_ were given over a period of 4 years
first noted in 1956 , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ at that time showed `` scattered _RARE_ of fibrosis '' _RARE_ of _RARE_
_RARE_ were necessary after the institution of _RARE_ in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with _RARE_ _RARE_ to 10 mg. daily
was continued until February , 1958
, 1958 , the patient suffered a _RARE_ _RARE_ complicated by pulmonary _RARE_
at this time included _RARE_ , peripheral _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_
was _RARE_ gm.
_RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ and salt _RARE_ became necessary to control the _RARE_ of chronic _RARE_ failure
increasing _RARE_ , _RARE_ , 8 mg. daily , was started on _RARE_ 23 , 1958 , and was continued until July , 1958
, 1958 , the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was _RARE_ with _RARE_ of his _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ was _RARE_ gm.
attempt to reverse the _RARE_ trend by _RARE_ the bone _RARE_ and controlling any _RARE_ component , _RARE_ , 16 mg. daily , was begun on _RARE_ 26 , 1958 , and continued until _RARE_ 18 , 1959
the patient felt stronger , and the _RARE_ rose to _RARE_ gm. , but on _RARE_ 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` _RARE_ in '' in his knees
8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involving the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , was pronounced , and a common _RARE_ was `` difficulty in _RARE_ up on to _RARE_ ''
30 mg. daily , was substituted for _RARE_ from _RARE_ 22 until _RARE_ 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness
at this time was _RARE_ _RARE_ per _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ was _RARE_ gm. By _RARE_ 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ muscle groups was _RARE_ worse , and it became difficult for the patient to rise _RARE_ from a sitting or _RARE_ position
16 mg. daily , was resumed and maintained until _RARE_ 18 , 1959
omitted for a _RARE_ period , but there was no change in the muscle weakness
time a detailed _RARE_ examination revealed _RARE_ muscle _RARE_ that was moderate in the hands and feet , but marked in the shoulders , hips , and _RARE_ _RARE_ , with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
or _RARE_ _RARE_ were found
no evidence of lower motor _RARE_ disease
tests yielded normal results
iodine was _RARE_ mg. , and the _RARE_ iodine _RARE_ over the thyroid gland was _RARE_ in 24 hours , with a conversion ratio of _RARE_
test demonstrated normal absorption of _RARE_ Af
, 1959 , during the second admission to The New York Hospital , a _RARE_ specimen of the left _RARE_ showed striking increase in the _RARE_ _RARE_ nuclei and _RARE_ muscle fibers in several sections
_RARE_ levels remained normal ; ; the serum _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ was 10 units per _RARE_ per _RARE_
impression at this time was either muscular _RARE_ or _RARE_
12 , 1959 , purified _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) , 20 units daily _RARE_ , was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention
3 to May 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintained on _RARE_ , 3 to 6 mg. daily
1959 , _RARE_ , 30 mg. daily , replaced the _RARE_
did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then _RARE_
of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of _RARE_ , _RARE_ mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to _RARE_ muscle weakness
to _RARE_ _RARE_ entirely were _RARE_ because increased muscle weakness resulted , as well as fever , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , anxiety , and an _RARE_ of the _RARE_
were interpreted as being _RARE_ of _RARE_
pain in June , 1959 , _RARE_ a third hospital admission
with _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ was found
diet , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ failed to change the _RARE_ _RARE_ or the severe muscle weakness
hospital admission on June _RARE_ , 1959 , was necessitated by continued weakness and _RARE_ complicated by _RARE_ retention and painful _RARE_ _RARE_
of the _RARE_ column showed _RARE_ of the _RARE_
4 , 1959 , the patient developed marked _RARE_ pain and _RARE_ , went into shock , and died

thought to represent _RARE_ fibers
failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles
of the sections examined , the _RARE_ and small arteries were essentially normal
the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the _RARE_ _RARE_ used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with _RARE_ insoluble _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by _RARE_ _RARE_ ( E. F. Smith & _RARE_ ) on sweet clover stems
) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins _RARE_ from healthy sweet clover stems
were _RARE_ with 3 volumes of Af in Af to give a nearly neutral _RARE_ and precipitated by _RARE_ _RARE_ with Af
was washed twice with an _RARE_ _RARE_ solution of Af , dissolved in a small quantity of _RARE_ M neutral phosphate buffer , _RARE_ against cold _RARE_ water till free from _RARE_ ions , and _RARE_ using liquid nitrogen
) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of _RARE_ _RARE_ as recommended by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1957 )
) The conjugates were passed through a _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) cellulose column _RARE_ with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Af _RARE_ phosphate and Af
frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by _RARE_ et al ( 1951 )
stem tumors from sweet clover plants _RARE_ with WTV were _RARE_ in liquid nitrogen , _RARE_ in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 _RARE_ in a _RARE_ maintained at _RARE_ to _RARE_
were mounted on cold _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) in earlier experiments , and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( 1959 )
_RARE_ was found to be much more satisfactory
were then _RARE_ by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a _RARE_ for 30 minutes ; ; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks
indirect method
were fixed in _RARE_ for 15 minutes and dried at _RARE_ for 30 minutes
them were then covered with a drop of Af in a moist _RARE_ at _RARE_ for 30 - 40 minutes
other sections were similarly covered with Aj
then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes
out most of the saline around the sections , a drop of Af was _RARE_ over each of the sections , allowed to react for 30 minutes , and then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes
out most of the liquid around the sections , the latter were mounted in _RARE_ _RARE_ ( 7 parts _RARE_ to 3 parts of PBS )

the sections under the _RARE_ , fixing in _RARE_ , and drying at _RARE_ as in the indirect method , the sections were treated with _RARE_ Af or Af ( _RARE_ unless mentioned otherwise ) for 5 - 30 minutes
, other sections were similarly treated with Af or _RARE_ _RARE_ to the New York strain of _RARE_ _RARE_ virus ( _RARE_ and Black , 1956 )
were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes and mounted in _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ or _RARE_ sections were examined under dark field _RARE_ in a _RARE_ fluorescence _RARE_ equipped with a _RARE_ vapor lamp ( _RARE_ _RARE_ 200 )
beam from the lamp was _RARE_ through a _RARE_ thickness _RARE_ _RARE_ filter
_RARE_ a _RARE_ 2 B filter was used to filter off _RARE_ _RARE_ light
filter , _RARE_ _RARE_ filter with the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ _RARE_ 23 , was also used in the _RARE_ lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence
of staining indirect method
first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder
sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder
sweet clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1 : 10 solution of Af for 30 minutes , washed in _RARE_ saline for 15 minutes , stained with Af for 30 minutes , and washed for 15 minutes in Aj
showed bright _RARE_ specific fluorescence in the cells of the pseudophloem tissue ( Lee and Black , 1955 )
fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in _RARE_ sections stained with 1 : 10 dilution of NS and Af or with Af alone
mounted in _RARE_ _RARE_ or sections treated only with NS or Af did not show such green fluorescence
crown gall tissue similarly stained with either Af and Af or NS and Af also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence
the nonspecific staining by the Af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen
of Af with _RARE_ _RARE_ or two _RARE_ of Af ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) , NS and Af with crown gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining
all the sera with sweet clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence , especially when the treated conjugate was _RARE_ to 1 : 2 with _RARE_ saline
the above procedures , when the intermediate sera were _RARE_ to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with _RARE_ saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not _RARE_ reduced , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 : _RARE_ or _RARE_ the Af to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence
sections with PBS before _RARE_ the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction
to other _RARE_ , _RARE_ the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before _RARE_ Af did not reduce nonspecific staining
treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate through a DEAE-cellulose column
ml of conjugate was passed through a column ( Af ) , the first and second _RARE_ fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments , and very little in others
latter cases an additional treatment of the _RARE_ Af with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the specificity
_RARE_ the conjugate did not _RARE_ healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily _RARE_ from the bright _RARE_ specific staining
purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of _RARE_ the sections with 1 : 10 dilution of Af for 30 minutes , washing with PBS for 15 minutes , staining with Af for 30 minutes , and washing with PBS for 15 minutes
of staining in WTV tumors with Af and Af but not with NS and Af or with _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ virus and Af , and the absence of such staining in crown gall tumor tissue from _RARE_ , indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained

first _RARE_ with 50 mg of _RARE_ per _RARE_ of _RARE_
was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue _RARE_ in the same manner as described for the indirect method
cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still _RARE_ from specific fluorescence
experiments , Af and Af were prepared by _RARE_ 8 mg of _RARE_ per _RARE_ of _RARE_
Af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate ( with 50 mg _RARE_ per _RARE_ of _RARE_ ) while the specific staining was similar in both cases
could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column as described for Af
staining procedure with this purified Af consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 minutes and washing in PBS for 15 minutes
of staining with Af was established as follows : Af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover
tumors _RARE_ by WTV were not similarly stained with _RARE_ normal serum or _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ virus
Af through DEAE-cellulose , the _RARE_ of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the _RARE_ before such passage ( _RARE_ ring tests by R. F. _RARE_ ) ; ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining
that increase in specificity of Af after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution
by DEAE-cellulose treated Af and Af , although clearly _RARE_ under the _RARE_ from either nonspecific staining or _RARE_ of cells , was not satisfactorily _RARE_ to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color _RARE_
chiefly because of the _RARE_ white _RARE_ from the cells
from the walls of the _RARE_ cells was particularly brilliant
virus antigen Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the _RARE_ of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors
antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue
few isolated _RARE_ cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the _RARE_ region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in _RARE_ , cortex , most _RARE_ cells , _RARE_ cells , or _RARE_
pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the _RARE_
was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells
are thought to represent the nuclei
tumor sections small spherical bodies , possibly _RARE_ bodies ( _RARE_ and Black , 1952 ) stained more intensely than the rest of _RARE_ and probably contained more antigen
cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of WTV antigen
both the direct and indirect methods of staining , the conjugates had _RARE_ staining fractions
indirect method , this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with NS and Af or with Af only
direct method , Af , not further treated , stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems _RARE_ and WTV tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable Af
and Af were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present
the conjugates with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the conjugates ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse liver powder , sweet clover crown gall tissue powder , or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove _RARE_ staining substances in the conjugates
of the conjugates have usually been successful in _RARE_ nonspecific staining in several other systems ( _RARE_ , 1958 )
_RARE_ ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ virus
for the failure of these _RARE_ to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known
work the best procedure for _RARE_ substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second _RARE_ fractions with sweet clover tissue powder
staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few _RARE_ cells in the _RARE_ region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors
of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is _RARE_ distributed in the _RARE_
is a _RARE_ _RARE_ virus not easily _RARE_ by mechanical _RARE_ ( Black , 1944 ; ; _RARE_ et al , 1954 )
and apparent _RARE_ of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to _RARE_ plants
reactions in the higher _RARE_ depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex
with _RARE_ application of _RARE_ on the _RARE_ cortex , the transmission of _RARE_ from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated
the _RARE_ of the hypothalamus to _RARE_ stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions
complex and obviously _RARE_ induced forms of emotional _RARE_ could be _RARE_ in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress
_RARE_ conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges
to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional _RARE_ of the _RARE_
, the _RARE_ relations play a great role in _RARE_ , as _RARE_ interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' _RARE_
in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the _RARE_ , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the _RARE_ brain is _RARE_ by the _RARE_
_RARE_ the importance of the _RARE_ brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the _RARE_ brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions
be added that in man _RARE_ _RARE_ probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and _RARE_
are obviously of great importance for the _RARE_ and quantitative emotional response
brain as well as the _RARE_ is known to contribute to memory , but this _RARE_ is beyond the scope of this paper

and its significance After this brief discussion of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ relations , let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance
take place between _RARE_ and hypothalamus via _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
discharges induced by _RARE_ application of _RARE_ to a minute area in the _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ present in the hypothalamus and cause increased _RARE_ discharges
other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic _RARE_ through the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ into the _RARE_ hypothalamus causes a _RARE_ in frequency and _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ until the hypothalamic _RARE_ is restored
a positive _RARE_ exists between the _RARE_ hypothalamus and the _RARE_ cortex
if for any reason the hypothalamic _RARE_ falls below the physiological level , the _RARE_ _RARE_ discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the _RARE_ discharges
a vicious cycle _RARE_
can be broken either by _RARE_ hypothalamic _RARE_ directly or via _RARE_ _RARE_
believed that drug therapy and _RARE_ involve the former and _RARE_ the latter mechanism
comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from _RARE_
a low intensity of _RARE_ discharges _RARE_ in sleep and a high one during _RARE_ , resulting in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in the former and _RARE_ in the latter condition
the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal _RARE_ of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level _RARE_ , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a _RARE_ in the reactivity of the _RARE_ and motor apparatus of the _RARE_ nervous system
dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur
stimulation of the _RARE_ hypothalamus produces the effects of _RARE_ while stimulation of the _RARE_ hypothalamus _RARE_ sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole _RARE_ is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus
can be induced _RARE_ via the _RARE_ _RARE_ in man and animals
importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect
drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance
comprise _RARE_ and _RARE_ drugs , the latter the _RARE_
exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as , for instance , between _RARE_ and _RARE_
these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce _RARE_ , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes _RARE_ effects and , eventually , _RARE_ changes
states produced by drugs influence the _RARE_ _RARE_ in a characteristic manner ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of the experimental animal after administration of _RARE_ , but _RARE_ after application of _RARE_ and _RARE_ drugs
_RARE_ act likewise on the hypothalamic balance
and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the _RARE_ controlled _RARE_ _RARE_ and increase sympathetic discharges
the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side
the beneficial effect of _RARE_ therapy in certain _RARE_ and a shift in the reaction from _RARE_ to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the _RARE_ test
have found a _RARE_ between _RARE_ and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the _RARE_ test and , _RARE_ , between clinical _RARE_ and increasing deviation of this test from the _RARE_
the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of _RARE_ patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients
and _RARE_ tests applied with certain _RARE_ are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of _RARE_ autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable
assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring _RARE_ in _RARE_ patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the _RARE_ cycle
in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ and _RARE_
conditions the emotional and _RARE_ sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such as is seen _RARE_ or may be produced in normal persons by drugs
differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be _RARE_
clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to _RARE_ _RARE_ in reactivity
of parasympathetic `` _RARE_ '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the _RARE_ reactivity of this structure to direct and _RARE_ induced _RARE_ , but leads also to an autonomic _RARE_ : a stimulus acting _RARE_ under control conditions _RARE_ in this state of _RARE_ a parasympathetic response
conditioned reactions are _RARE_ altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is _RARE_ beyond a critical level , and several types of _RARE_ changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` _RARE_ '' are observed
for instance , such a change is produced by one or a few _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ , previously _RARE_ conditioned reactions _RARE_
if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily _RARE_
studies , loss of _RARE_ in previously established conditioned _RARE_ resulted from repeated _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ processes
further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental _RARE_ in its initial stages is associated with a _RARE_ shift in the central autonomic balance ; ; ( 2 ) drugs _RARE_ the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions ; ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to _RARE_ a conditioned reaction but cause an increased _RARE_ instead of the _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) effect on the Aj
few and seemingly _RARE_ data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental _RARE_ in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological _RARE_ , _RARE_ action , or clinical processes

physiological basis of some form of _RARE_ The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion
is the case , one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise
out that emotional excitement may lead to _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the _RARE_ of a strong emotion ( `` _RARE_ '' ) may cure a battle _RARE_
_RARE_ the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the _RARE_
strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself
and therapeutic work lie in this area
_RARE_ that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical _RARE_ and assumed , therefore , that the _RARE_ changes which _RARE_ the _RARE_ are functional and _RARE_
observation of _RARE_ served as a guide post to achieve such a _RARE_ by physiological means
_RARE_ experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain
electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding
became thus the symbol for food and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( conditioned _RARE_ )
the intensity of the _RARE_ was increased gradually , it failed to _RARE_ any signs of pain
_RARE_ _RARE_ produce an experimental _RARE_ during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , _RARE_ thought that he could _RARE_ the _RARE_ antagonism to inhibit the _RARE_ symptoms through feeding
showed that this is , indeed , possible
applied this principle of reciprocal _RARE_ to human _RARE_
advantage of the antagonism between aggressive _RARE_ and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established
interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and _RARE_ functions which are closely associated with the emotions
antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the _RARE_ and _RARE_ systems
a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety
both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different _RARE_ patterns _RARE_ _RARE_ and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , the state of the muscle tone , and the _RARE_ test
_RARE_ of these emotional states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference

In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ systems , respectively
the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the _RARE_ downward discharge as well as regarding the _RARE_ discharge
are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that _RARE_ in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the _RARE_ discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various _RARE_ and states of emotions in man and _RARE_ under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical _RARE_ , and as the result of _RARE_ agents
of the important role which emotional _RARE_ play in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic _RARE_ may play an important role in _RARE_ mental changes

decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the _RARE_ space V , by _RARE_ T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary
do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the _RARE_ field F into a product of distinct _RARE_ polynomials of degree 1
we do with the general T
try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems
T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the _RARE_ field , namely , that it is not _RARE_ closed
even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V
clearly a deficiency in T
situation is illustrated by the operator T on Af ( F any field ) represented in the standard basis by Af
polynomial for A is Af and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T )
is not diagonalizable
that this happens because the null space of Af has dimension 1 only
other hand , the null space of Af and the null space of Af together span V , the former being the subspace _RARE_ by Af and the latter the subspace _RARE_ by Af and Af
be more or less our general method for the second problem
remember this is an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for T _RARE_ Af where Af are distinct elements of F , then we shall show that the space V is the direct sum of the null spaces of Af
operator is the special case of this in which Af for each _RARE_
which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the _RARE_ which enter are all of first degree
will find it helpful to think of the special case when the _RARE_ are of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think of the proof of Theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem

decomposition theorem )
be a linear operator on the _RARE_ vector space V over the field F
be the minimal polynomial for T , Af , where the Af , are distinct _RARE_ _RARE_ polynomials over F and the Af are positive _RARE_
be the null space of Af
A ) Af ; ; ( B ) each Af is invariant under T ; ; ( C ) if Af is the operator induced on Af by T , then the minimal polynomial for Af is Af

of the proof is this
_RARE_ decomposition ( A ) is valid , how can we get hold of the projections Af associated with the decomposition
Af will be the identity on Af and zero on the other Af
find a polynomial Af such that Af is the identity on Af and is zero on the other Af , and so that Af , etc.
_RARE_ , let Af
are distinct prime polynomials , the polynomials Af are relatively prime ( Theorem 8 , Chapter 4 )
are polynomials Af such that Af
that if Af , then Af is _RARE_ by the polynomial p , because Af contains each Af as a factor
show that the polynomials Af behave in the manner described in the first _RARE_ of the proof

and P divides Af for Af , we have Af
Af are projections which _RARE_ to some _RARE_ decomposition of the space V
to show that the range of Af is exactly the subspace Af
clear that each vector in the range of Af is in Af for if _RARE_ is in the range of Af , then Af and so Af because Af is _RARE_ by the minimal polynomial P
suppose that _RARE_ is in the null space of Af
, then Af is _RARE_ by Af and so Af , i.e. , Af
it is immediate that Af , i.e. , that _RARE_ is in the range of Af
the proof of statement ( A )
certainly clear that the _RARE_ Af are invariant under T
is the operator induced on Af by T , then evidently Af , because by definition Af is 0 on the subspace Af
that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af
let G be any polynomial such that Af

is _RARE_ by the minimal polynomial P of T , i.e. , Af divides Af
easily seen that Af divides G
minimal polynomial for Af is Af

are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of T , then each Af is a polynomial in T , and _RARE_ if a linear operator U _RARE_ with T then U _RARE_ with each of the Af , i.e. , each subspace Af is invariant under U
_RARE_ of the proof of Theorem 12 , let us take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for T is a product of _RARE_ polynomials , i.e. , the case in which each Af is of the form Af
range of Af is the null space Af of Af
put Af
10 , D is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of T
look at the operator Af
Af so Af
should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that Af and in general that Af
for each _RARE_ , we shall have Af , because the operator Af will then be 0 on the range of Af

be a linear operator on the vector space V
that N is nilpotent if there is some positive _RARE_ R such that Af

be a linear operator on the _RARE_ vector space V over the field F
the minimal polynomial for T _RARE_ over F into a product of linear polynomials
is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N in V such that ( A ) Af , ( _RARE_ ) Af
operator D and the nilpotent operator N are uniquely determined by ( A ) and ( B ) and each of them is a polynomial in T

just observed that we can write Af where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T
that we also have Af where _RARE_ is diagonalizable , N' is nilpotent , and Af
prove that Af
and N' commute with one another and Af , we see that _RARE_ and N' commute with T
and N' commute with any polynomial in T ; ; hence they commute with D and with N
have Af or Af and all four of these operators commute with one another
and _RARE_ are both diagonalizable and they commute , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and Af is diagonalizable
and N' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator Af is nilpotent ; ; for , using the fact that N and N' commute Af and so when R is sufficiently large every term in this expression for Af will be 0
, a nilpotent operator on an _RARE_ space must have its T power 0 ; ; if we take Af above , that will be large enough
follows that Af is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression
Af is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent
operator is obviously the zero operator ; ; for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form Af for some Af ; ; but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; ; hence Af and the minimal polynomial is simply _RARE_ , which says the operator is 0
see that Af and Af

be a _RARE_ vector space over an _RARE_ closed field F , e.g. , the field of complex numbers
linear operator T in V can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute
D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T
results , one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an _RARE_ closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators
spaces over _RARE_ closed fields , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors
a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter
this section , we should like to give an example which _RARE_ some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem
chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear _RARE_

primary decomposition theorem , it is not necessary that the vector space V be finite dimensional , nor is it necessary for parts ( A ) and ( B ) that P be the minimal polynomial for T
is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a _RARE_ polynomial P such that Af , then parts ( A ) and ( B ) of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave
be a positive _RARE_ and let V be the space of all N times continuously _RARE_ functions F on the real line which satisfy the differential equation Af where Af are some fixed constants
denotes the space of N times continuously _RARE_ functions , then the space V of solutions of this differential equation is a subspace of Af
denotes the _RARE_ operator and P is the polynomial Af then V is the null space of the operator p ( , ) , because Af simply says Af
now regard D as a linear operator on the subspace V

are discussing _RARE_ _RARE_ functions , then Af and V are complex vector spaces , and Af may be any complex numbers
write Af where Af are distinct complex numbers
is the null space of Af , then Theorem 12 says that Af
words , if F _RARE_ the differential equation Af , then F is uniquely _RARE_ in the form Af where Af _RARE_ the differential equation Af
the study of the solutions to the equation Af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form Af
has been accomplished by the general methods of linear _RARE_ , i.e. , by the primary decomposition theorem
the space of solutions to Af , one must know something about differential equations ; ; that is , one must know something about D other than the fact that it is a linear operator
one does not need to know very much
very easy to establish by _RARE_ on R that if F is in Af then Af ; ; that is , Af , etc.
if and only if Af
G such that Af , i.e. , Af , must be a polynomial function of degree Af or less : Af
_RARE_ Af if and only if F has the form Af
the ' functions ' Af span the space of solutions of Af
are _RARE_ independent functions and the _RARE_ function has no _RARE_ , these R functions Af , form a basis for the space of solutions

binomial experiments Some experiments are composed of _RARE_ of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes
probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another
a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a _RARE_ model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that _RARE_ in many other probability models
with a few examples of binomial experiments

marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times
sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary
we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes
mice
of eight mice from similar parents , the number of mice with straight instead of _RARE_ hair is an _RARE_ from 0 to 8
should be attached to these possible outcomes
ones ) with three dice
dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of _RARE_ is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 )
problem
, suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` _RARE_ '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial
examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a _RARE_ mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success ''
, any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success ''
question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly X successes in N trials
3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by counting points in a sample space
a general formula of wide _RARE_ _RARE_ all problems of this kind
this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind ''
often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated
_RARE_ example , a trial consists of `` one round shot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure )
an experiment might consist of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a _RARE_ composed of several _RARE_ of the _RARE_ experiment
dice are tossed , a trial is one _RARE_ of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials
what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each _RARE_ is a trial , and the three _RARE_ form the experiment
we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times
are _RARE_ of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too _RARE_

managers
act as managers for a _RARE_ _RARE_ team , and of these managers a proportion P are _RARE_ drivers
one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck
_RARE_ the _RARE_ has needed a driver
these _RARE_ , what is the probability that the _RARE_ had drivers all 3 times
times



there are 3 trials of interest
consists of _RARE_ a student manager at random
possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver '' or `` _RARE_ ''
choice is by lot each week , the outcomes of different trials are independent
stay the same , so that Af is the same for all weeks
_RARE_ these ideas for general binomial experiments
experiment to _RARE_ as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other
use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties
give , for each property , an example where the property is absent
and _RARE_ introduced are standard throughout the chapter

be a fixed number _RARE_ of repeated trials
marksman , we study sets of five shots ( Af ) ; ; for the mice , we restrict attention to _RARE_ of eight ( Af ) ; ; and for the _RARE_ , we _RARE_ three dice ( Af )
a fixed number of trials
die until an ace appears
number of trials is a random variable , not a fixed number


the N trials is either a success or a failure
'' and `` failure '' are just convenient _RARE_ for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general
are more _RARE_ than _RARE_ like `` A '' and `` _RARE_ ''
natural from the _RARE_ _RARE_ to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category _RARE_ to straight hair in a mouse
`` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both _RARE_ apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms P and Af that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure ''
there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have _RARE_ constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` _RARE_ ''
the _RARE_ property
mice as `` _RARE_ '' or `` _RARE_ '' , but a _RARE_ mouse appears
escape from such a difficulty by _RARE_ out the animal as not _RARE_ a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory

have identical probabilities of success
has probability Af of producing an ace ; ; the marksman has some probability p , perhaps _RARE_ , of making a bull's-eye
we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial
p is not constant
round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and _RARE_ the marksman , _RARE_ his chance of a bull's-eye

are independent
, this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by _RARE_ together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials
the _RARE_ example Af , Af , and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace , _RARE_ , ace in that order is Af
we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another
independence fails
of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains , and a coin is tossed to decide
to know the number of people going to the mountains
experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent
the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family
is a less extreme example of dependence
visiting an art _RARE_
votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular _RARE_
one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure ''
consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials
of the experiment from couple to couple , the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couples who visit the _RARE_ together are more likely to have similar _RARE_ than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors
_RARE_ the point
shows that _RARE_ of the boys and _RARE_ of the girls vote for picture A
under independent voting , Af or _RARE_ of the couples would cast two votes for picture A , and Af or _RARE_ would cast two votes for picture B
independent voting , Af or _RARE_ of the couples would agree
7-1 shows that Af or _RARE_ agree , too many for independent voting
of an _RARE_ binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through N as the value of the random variable X , where Af
to study the probability function of this random variable
, we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes , not which shots were bull's-eyes
experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes
, the marksman gets 5 shots , but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye , that is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no bull's-eye )
do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random variable is not the number of successes
of P and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice
very slight changes in P do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an _RARE_ difference

the other hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a _RARE_ for comparative purposes ; ; that is , we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its _RARE_ from the binomial model
: A binomial experiment consists of Af independent binomial trials , all with the same probability Af of _RARE_ a success
of the experiment is X successes
variable X takes the values Af with probabilities Af or , more briefly Af
find a formula for the probability of exactly X successes for given values of P and N
number of successes X is _RARE_ with its probability of occurrence Af , the set of pairs Af , is a probability function called a binomial distribution
of P and N determines the binomial distribution uniquely , and different _RARE_ always produce different distributions ( except when Af ; ; then the number of successes is always 0 )
of all binomial distributions is called the family of binomial distributions , but in general discussions this expression is often _RARE_ to `` the binomial distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear
were treated by James _RARE_ about _RARE_ , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called _RARE_ trials

trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success
binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities Q and P respectively
trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials

gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth
of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1
of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random variables here
is X , the total number of successes , which in this experiment has the value Af
simple , closed , plane curve C which is a _RARE_ image of the unit circle , and which is given by Af
real analytic _RARE_ functions with period T
following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares
is similar to the theorem of _RARE_ that there exists a _RARE_ _RARE_ around any closed , bounded _RARE_ set in Af
theorem has been generalized by _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and _RARE_ to show that in Af there are families of such _RARE_
for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the _RARE_ to _RARE_ and give certain other results
inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C
the _RARE_ Af , with the two _RARE_ connected by a straight line _RARE_ only one inscribed square
has one corner point on the straight line _RARE_ , and does not lie entirely in the interior
, from the point P at Af to the point Q at Af , we construct the _RARE_ , and upon the _RARE_ as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C
increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , Af and Af , adjacent to P and Q respectively
approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both Af and Af must cross C an odd number of times as S varies from zero to T
may also touch C without crossing
_RARE_ C when Af
have certain squares with three corners on C
such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the _RARE_ point of the square
on C , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding _RARE_ points by the above construction
_RARE_ vertex and _RARE_ point there _RARE_ a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing T
vertex is at Af , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing _RARE_ , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C _RARE_ through _RARE_ about the vertex
of intersections of Af , the _RARE_ curve , with the original curve C consists of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at Af , plus the vertex itself
that two such curves C and Af , cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points ; ; otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points , which is impossible since they do not coincide near Af
vertex we _RARE_ certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter T between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points
vertex at Af , these values will be denoted by Af
f{t} defined in this way is _RARE_
now the graph of the function f{t} on Af
refer to the plane of C and Af as the C-plane and to the plane of the graph as the Aj
, as a set , may have a finite number of components
_RARE_ the values of f{t} on different components by Af
with _RARE_ T on the graph represents an intersection between C and Af
two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection
point will be any point of intersection A such that in every neighborhood of A in the C-plane , Af meets both the interior and the _RARE_ of C
point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point
will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj
now prove several _RARE_

neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function _RARE_ is a single-valued , continuous function

show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood
vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the _RARE_ location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and Af
f-plane the _RARE_ of the corresponding point are Af
that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic
C-plane we construct a set of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , V with the origin at Q and such that both C and Af have finite slope at Q
, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U
neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued , analytic function of U
one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is _RARE_ , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of _RARE_ in any interval
to find Af , one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q
is just the curve Af translated without rotation through a small arc , for Af is always obtained by rotating C through exactly _RARE_
is itself a _RARE_ of an analytic curve
E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a _RARE_ function
Af is single-valued near Q
also seen that Af , since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation
is also continuous at Af , and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point
now to the set of tangent points on the graph
must consist of isolated points and closed intervals
that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a _RARE_ function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point
the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points

neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say Af , the function Af is either _RARE_ or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single-valued

point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another
change in T through an amount E results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve Af
three possibilities : ( A ) Af remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ; ( B ) Af moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for Af ; ; ( C ) Af cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every T in Af
possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the f-plane , the end points of which fall into category ( B ) or ( C )
second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af
third category the function is _RARE_ in this interval
remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af
the _RARE_ of the two curves _RARE_ that such intervals exist
neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is _RARE_ or _RARE_ on one side , and is a single-valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side
above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F
for any value of T for which all values of f{t} are ordinary points the number of values of f{t} must be odd
is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and Af must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , Af could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at T is the argument of the function , not a value
for any value of T the number of values of f{t} is equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument T plus an odd number

of ordinary values of the function f{t} at T will be called its multiplicity at T

of _RARE_ has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj

not
component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded _RARE_
is defined in the _RARE_ Af
and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane ; ; otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points
we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of F can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even _RARE_
multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number
true of all components which have such a bounded support
is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T
shown that the graph of F contains at least one component whose _RARE_ is the entire interval _RARE_ , and whose multiplicity is odd
be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components
( incomplete ) components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument , and are defined only on a proper _RARE_ of Aj
now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding _RARE_ points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C
consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C
a square with _RARE_ as a side and with free corners Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively
varies from zero to T , the values of S for which Af and Af cross C will be denoted by Af and Af respectively
Af , plus tangent points
are just the ordinary values of Af

Af are the ordinary values at Af of a _RARE_ function _RARE_ which has components corresponding to those of f{t}

define a function _RARE_ as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at _RARE_ , _RARE_ is the corresponding set of positive _RARE_ differences between T and the backward corner points
F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T
P fixed at Af , _RARE_ occur when the corner Af _RARE_ C , and are among the values of S such that Af
of this equation are just the _RARE_ of the intersections of the graph of B with a straight line of unit slope through Af in the _RARE_ ( the plane of the graph of _RARE_ )
these values as Af , and define _RARE_ in the same way for each T
obtain _RARE_ by _RARE_ an _RARE_ _RARE_ in the Aj

we _RARE_ a new series of line _RARE_ in a _RARE_ space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers
defined by a simple _RARE_ transformation of the points in which a general line meets a _RARE_ quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Af
2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1
of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible

be a _RARE_ quadric surface bearing _RARE_ Af and Af , and let **zg be a Af curve of order K on Q
line L meets Q in two points , Af and Af , through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus , Af , whose lines are simple secants of Aj
generators let Af and Af be , respectively , the _RARE_ conjugates of Af and Af with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets Aj
Af is the image of L
the transformation is _RARE_
first that no line , _RARE_ , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q
it did , the plane of L and _RARE_ would contain two generators of Af , which is impossible
from the _RARE_ transformation of _RARE_ on the generators of Af , it is clear that the only points of Q at which a line can meet its image are the points of Aj
_RARE_ of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj
lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of **zg , since each of these meets Q in two points which are invariant
of this congruence is Af , since Af secants of a curve of symbol ( B ) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point
of the congruence is Af , since an arbitrary plane meets **zg in K points
complex of singular lines is of order K and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula Af that the order of the involution is Af
various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique
obvious of these is the _RARE_ complex of tangents to Q , each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of _RARE_ of the given line
of tangents to Q are transformed into _RARE_ of tangents
interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such _RARE_ , so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent
lines of any plane , _RARE_ , meeting Q in a _RARE_ C , are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve _RARE_ into which C is transformed in the point involution on Q
, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to _RARE_
if Af and Af are two planes _RARE_ in a line _RARE_ , tangent to Q at a point P , the two free intersections of the image curves Af and Af must coincide at _RARE_ , the image of P , and at this point Af and Af must have a common tangent _RARE_
thought of as a line in a particular plane _RARE_ , any tangent to Q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through L
, **yl , of Af is also exceptional , for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point involution on Q
is of symbol Af since it meets **yl , and hence every line of Af in the Af invariant points on **yl and since it obviously meets every line of Af in a single point
of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af
class of exceptional lines is _RARE_ from the following considerations : Since no two generators of Af can intersect , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections
words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all
only way in which all curves of the image family of Af can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of Af which is not a secant but a tangent of **zg , for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of _RARE_
curves of symbol Af on Q intersect in Af points , it follows that there are Af lines of Af which are tangent to Aj
any line , _RARE_ , of any bundle having one of these points of _RARE_ , T , as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of L and Q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of Af which is tangent to **zg at T
through two of these points , Af and Af , will be transformed into the entire _RARE_ congruence having the tangents to **zg at Af and Af as _RARE_
, C , being a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on Q , meets the image of any line of Af , which we have already found to be a Af curve on Q , in Af points
image , _RARE_ , meets any line of Af in Af points
_RARE_ obviously meets any line Af in a single point
is a Af curve on Q
the congruence of its secants , that is the image of a general plane field of lines , is of order Af and class Af
the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines , namely Af and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines , namely Af

observations make it clear that there exist line _RARE_ of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve Aj
shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described
this we must first show that every line which meets **zg in a point P meets its image at P
this , consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj
1 ) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order Af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order Af
there is a Af correspondence in which the Af points cut from C by a general line , _RARE_ , of the pencil _RARE_ to the point of intersection of the image of L and the plane of the pencil
is rational , this correspondence has K _RARE_ , each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image
since the pencil contains a secant of **zg it actually contains only Af singular lines
this contradiction it is necessary that C be composite , with the secant of **zg and a curve of order Af as components
follows that the secants of **zg are all invariant
this is the case , then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point , P , of **zg as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order Af having Af generators _RARE_ at P
ruled surface of order N with N _RARE_ generators is necessarily a _RARE_ , it follows finally that every line through a point , P , of **zg meets its image at P , as _RARE_
the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex , P , on **zg which is effected by the involution as a whole
preceding remarks , it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an _RARE_ fashion
in this involution there is a _RARE_ of invariant lines of order Af , namely the _RARE_ of secants of **zg which pass through P
follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective De _RARE_ involution of order Af and the invariant _RARE_ must have a multiple line of multiplicity either Af or Af
possibility requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points ; ; the second requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points
case , lines of the _RARE_ are transformed by _RARE_ within the _RARE_ they determine with the multiple secant
first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line _RARE_ the vertex , P , to the intersection of **zg and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant
second , the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex , P , to the two intersections of **zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant
secants , of course , are exceptional and in each case are transformed into _RARE_ of order Af
to these can be made at each point of Aj
must have either a regulus of _RARE_ secants or a regulus of _RARE_ secants
if Af , no two of the multiple secants can intersect
such were the case , either the plane of the two lines would meet **zg in more than K points or , _RARE_ , the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high
no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of **zg can intersect , then the regulus must be _RARE_ , or in other words , **zg must be either a Af or a Af curve on a _RARE_ quadric surface
observe that the case in which **zg is a Af curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet Aj
pencil in a plane containing a _RARE_ secant of **zg has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in Af lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of **zg and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil
if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely Af
the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of this paper , we must _RARE_ the possibility that **zg is a Af curve on a quadric surface
the case in which **zg is a Af curve on a quadric Q , we first observe that the second regulus of Q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of **zg and the planes through any one of the multiple secants
of these lines meets Q in three points , namely two points on **zg and one point on one of the multiple secants
an arbitrary line , _RARE_ , meeting Q in two points , Af and Af
is the multiple secant of **zg which passes through Af and _RARE_ is the simple secant of **zg which passes through Af , and if Af are the points in which _RARE_ meets **zg , and if Af is the image of Af on the generator _RARE_ , it follows that the image of the line Af is Af
can expect to face difficult times
_RARE_ processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their _RARE_ will be threatened by _RARE_ forces , the _RARE_ between _RARE_ and subjects , town and country , will _RARE_ ; ; new _RARE_ for power will emerge whose _RARE_ far exceed their competence ; ; old _RARE_ may lose their nerve and their sense of direction
will have to display the highest skills of _RARE_ to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's sense of identity
a community of interest will have to be _RARE_ -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared _RARE_ of the past
with _RARE_ and careful planning , some of the more _RARE_ and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped
States can help by _RARE_ a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible
goal should be to provide the greatest positive _RARE_ for these societies to _RARE_ _RARE_ the tasks which they face
same time , we should recognize that the _RARE_ to change and the lack of _RARE_ and stability which _RARE_ these countries may make them particularly _RARE_ to _RARE_ and external _RARE_ of all _RARE_
seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less _RARE_ by fishing in the _RARE_ waters of international politics than by facing up to the _RARE_ tasks at home
do what we can to _RARE_ this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by _RARE_ firmly to _RARE_ actions on the world scene
, we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to _RARE_ their potential for _RARE_ the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development
nation , we feel an _RARE_ to assist other countries in their development ; ; but this _RARE_ _RARE_ only to countries which are _RARE_ seeking to become responsible members of a stable and _RARE_ world community
When we look at countries like _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different _RARE_ for policy
in power are committed in principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only _RARE_
have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern
is likely to be characterized by having a fairly _RARE_ urban _RARE_ and a relatively _RARE_ rural _RARE_ , with very poor communications between the two
_RARE_ by psychological _RARE_ to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be _RARE_ to achieve the national goals of modernization already _RARE_ accepted
in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective
rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals
period has generally left people _RARE_ that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them -- and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the _RARE_ of modern life
, in accordance with the fashion of the times , most _RARE_ societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; ; such is the _RARE_ of planning that people expect that _RARE_ of the plan will follow automatically upon its _RARE_
services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal _RARE_ with the problems facing them ; ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice , _RARE_ , and competence
should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their _RARE_ there is not the slightest hope that they will either _RARE_ of _RARE_ their societies
spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm
, we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the _RARE_ fact that they are responsible for their _RARE_
the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest _RARE_ of performance can we provide telling assistance
to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their _RARE_ , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see
assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on _RARE_ the central governments to assume the role of _RARE_ and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments
encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and _RARE_ governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important _RARE_ of the economy is neglected
should be _RARE_ the _RARE_ of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above all , how progress in each field _RARE_ to national progress
as the _RARE_ Development Program in the _RARE_ have demonstrated that _RARE_ societies can work toward balanced national development
this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and _RARE_ of the people themselves are effectively taken into account
programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties
is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries
be American policy not only to encourage effective land _RARE_ programs but also to _RARE_ the relation of such _RARE_ to the economic growth and modernization of the society
isolated policy , land _RARE_ is likely to be _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance
also be recognized that the problem of rural _RARE_ cannot be solved by administrative _RARE_ alone
programs need to be _RARE_ with programs for promoting rural _RARE_ and technical assistance in _RARE_
governmental and private _RARE_ will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead
out prospects for external capital assistance , the United States can provide strong _RARE_ to prepare for the _RARE_ economic drive necessary to achieve _RARE_ growth
societies At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of _RARE_ growth
continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; ; and there _RARE_ the _RARE_ problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously _RARE_ participation in the program to wider and wider groups
countries have made big _RARE_ toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal _RARE_ and simultaneously with all the major _RARE_ of their _RARE_
economic front , the first priority of these countries is to _RARE_ a _RARE_ increased volume of resources
tasks must be carried out if _RARE_ growth is to be achieved
must _RARE_ a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public _RARE_ of the economy
in their planning be able to count on at least tentative _RARE_ of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years
drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined _RARE_ enough to permit domestic investment _RARE_ to go forward
must be coordinated with national needs and planning
a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural _RARE_ , and general balance of payments support
although the _RARE_ of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of _RARE_ growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange
many political and administrative problems to be solved
thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , _RARE_ are still _RARE_ in many _RARE_ ; ; even the _RARE_ Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken
in training _RARE_ and _RARE_ management personnel is still needed in many cases
also more basic problems
the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people
_RARE_ still exist among the _RARE_ elite to _RARE_ and thus to _RARE_ the need for centralized and _RARE_ practices
danger is that the _RARE_ middle class will feel itself increasingly _RARE_ from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of _RARE_
of _RARE_ and members of the new professional classes to contribute _RARE_ to national development is likely to be destroyed by a _RARE_ sense of _RARE_ toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional _RARE_ in the West
based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a _RARE_ of understanding about the national interest
the wisdom of their own actions , and _RARE_ by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push _RARE_ to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead more rigid and _RARE_ in their policies
toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the _RARE_ social and professional classes
attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and _RARE_ of _RARE_ open and _RARE_ societies
every _RARE_ to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in _RARE_ but friendly ways
factor We have emphasized that the _RARE_ process in each society will take a considerable period of time
exception of _RARE_ , foreign relations were _RARE_ concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least _RARE_ duration
now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at _RARE_
_RARE_ policies can _RARE_ affect the pace of transition ; ; but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social structure which each society must _RARE_
that any effective policy toward the _RARE_ countries must have a _RARE_ long working horizon
be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its _RARE_
affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy , especially in the context of economic aid
: Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , _RARE_ societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it _RARE_ into the whole social organization and functions _RARE_ in every part of it
like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex
diversity of religious _RARE_ , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion
for most of the population of _RARE_ advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain _RARE_ individual and social functions
inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences
inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , _RARE_ , and emotionally secure _RARE_ ; ; he is not greatly _RARE_ , and he is not _RARE_ ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows
several closely related inner functions
last analysis , religion is the means of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , expressing , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ man's _RARE_ experience -- the religious
first religious ; ; the _RARE_ follow
to satisfy human needs of great _RARE_
things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
experience is the sensing of _RARE_ , and in the higher religions , of a _RARE_ relationship with the _RARE_ power
this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , _RARE_ universe
the experience of being _RARE_ allied with what he cannot fully understand ; ; he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement
is a safe and permanent home
of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal
not permanent _RARE_ and disappearance ; ; man has a second chance
not lost in the _RARE_ of endless time ; ; he has endless being
its best also offers the experience of spiritual _RARE_ by _RARE_ man into the highest realm of the spirit
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ all the highest _RARE_ and values -- ethical , aesthetic , and religious -- of man formed in his culture
also the possibility , among higher religions , of _RARE_ consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and _RARE_
of religious experience that most _RARE_ seek not only provides , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ human _RARE_ , values , _RARE_ , and purposes ; ; it also provides facilities and _RARE_ for the development of personality , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
religious impulse , whether _RARE_ or _RARE_ , men have joy in living ; ; life leads somewhere
its best is out in front , ever _RARE_ and leading on , and , as _RARE_ put it , `` _RARE_ all man's scattered energies in one _RARE_ sense of his own infinite importance ''
same time that religion _RARE_ the individual _RARE_ to the _RARE_ and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme _RARE_ , it also has great therapeutic value for him
him aid , comfort , even _RARE_ , in meeting _RARE_ life situations where his own _RARE_ practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate
confronted with the _RARE_ _RARE_ , such as great natural _RARE_ and the great _RARE_ of life -- marriage , _RARE_ disease , _RARE_ , old age , the certainty of death
to _RARE_ with _RARE_ and other emotional disturbance and _RARE_
beliefs provide him with _RARE_ explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , _RARE_ him to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , fear , _RARE_ , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger
also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state
in _RARE_ , where held , functions as a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the here and now
accompanying a _RARE_ consciousness of _RARE_ or _RARE_ or some _RARE_ secret are relieved for the less _RARE_ or _RARE_ by confession , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
of individual _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ growing out of various social situations or individual _RARE_ or _RARE_ is _RARE_ for by _RARE_ in worship or prayer with a friendly , but _RARE_ _RARE_ , as well as by sympathetic _RARE_ with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving _RARE_ to emotions and energies
for these inner individual functions , religion _RARE_ in behalf of individual peace of mind and _RARE_ services for which there is no other institution
to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society
have never been _RARE_
_RARE_ necessary in both _RARE_ maintenance and _RARE_
of a community or society is always _RARE_ with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and _RARE_
supports , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and maintains the fundamental values
the United States , with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast _RARE_ _RARE_ , there is a general _RARE_ regarding the basic Christian values
demonstrated especially when there is awareness of _RARE_ different value _RARE_ elsewhere ; ; for example Americans _RARE_ to Christian values _RARE_ those of _RARE_ communism
also all of our major religious bodies officially _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ which is _RARE_ of our common religion
_RARE_ members -- the _RARE_ , marginal _RARE_ and so on -- have the values of Christian civilization _RARE_ in them
religion tends to _RARE_ the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the _RARE_ and _RARE_ values ; ; for example , those regarding material objects and _RARE_ ends
it gives _RARE_ , more than human _RARE_ , and even , through _RARE_ reference , _RARE_ and _RARE_ importance to some values ; ; for example , marriage as a _RARE_ , much _RARE_ as _RARE_ , occasionally the state as a _RARE_ instrument
certain values at least beyond questioning and _RARE_
to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends
leads to a conception of an over-all Social _RARE_ with a meaning _RARE_ in terms of ultimate ends ; ; for example , a plan that _RARE_ the will of God , which advances the _RARE_ of God , which involves social life as part of the _RARE_ _RARE_
some group ends and provides a _RARE_ of their _RARE_
social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action
it gives meaning to much social _RARE_ , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life
, there is no society so _RARE_ as to be completely without _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ends
and _RARE_
the _RARE_ , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social _RARE_ have grown out of religion
have varied widely from mere families , primitive , _RARE_ groups , and small modern _RARE_ and _RARE_ , to the _RARE_ of great _RARE_ , and great , widely dispersed world religions
group life in various ways
ultimate values , ends and goals _RARE_ by religion are a most important factor
system of values there can be no society
a value system _RARE_ , it always _RARE_ all who possess it ; ; it _RARE_ members of the society to operate as a system
of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , and form what _RARE_ calls a credo
points out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong is the group
_RARE_ and _RARE_ men by _RARE_ them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the _RARE_ the group
_RARE_ , and especially the closely related _RARE_ and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith
, in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large
_RARE_ , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , _RARE_ the _RARE_ together
ways of _RARE_ participating in significantly _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and ordered _RARE_ _RARE_ behavior
are mechanism for training in , and _RARE_ and _RARE_ , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly _RARE_ the solidarity of the group
long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things _RARE_ into one single moral community all those who _RARE_ to them ''
is that every religion _RARE_ to a community , and , _RARE_ , every community is in one aspect a religious unit
brought out in the common religious _RARE_ that _RARE_ even in the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ at many _RARE_ _RARE_ and public occasions in the United States ; ; and it is evidenced in the _RARE_ offered , in the frequent religious _RARE_ , and in the _RARE_ of points on religious grounds
effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that _RARE_ peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though _RARE_ dispersed and not _RARE_ organized
for _RARE_ years have been a prime example , though the _RARE_ of any world or _RARE_ religion are cases in point
be pointed out that the _RARE_ function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other _RARE_ -- political , _RARE_ , language , class , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , even economic
exercises a _RARE_ function
it acts as an _RARE_ for the people
a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not only in their own _RARE_ and policies and practices , but also in _RARE_ affairs having religious _RARE_
thus been a significant factor in the _RARE_ of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones
to support the _RARE_ precious _RARE_ , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living
has pointed out , the `` _RARE_ on symbols , on tradition , on sacred _RARE_ , on the _RARE_ of emotional feelings of identity and _RARE_ with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future ''
religion has also _RARE_ as a tremendous engine of _RARE_ , enforcement , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ of various other institutions
same time that religion exercises a _RARE_ influence , it also _RARE_ and _RARE_ both individuals and groups
the important individual and social action has been _RARE_ to religious _RARE_
ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent _RARE_ lights that _RARE_ people toward them with an almost _RARE_ force , _RARE_ energies and _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; for example , the _RARE_ , mission efforts , just wars
has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and _RARE_ of religion
reward systems that most religions _RARE_ have great _RARE_ effects
the most attractive _RARE_ , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely _RARE_ by its norms , but who engage in good works
acts as a powerful aid in social control , _RARE_ what men should or should not do
peoples the sanctions and _RARE_ of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; ; and in modern societies such influence is still great
its own _RARE_ _RARE_ that are at the same time _RARE_ of behavior for the here and now
the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was _RARE_ strong
lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a _RARE_ problem
, _RARE_ visible in a matter of days in the _RARE_ _RARE_ daily functioning , was a _RARE_ fear that some terrible harm would _RARE_ the second _RARE_ , whose birth had not been anticipated
_RARE_ fears threatened to burst into a _RARE_ panic concerning the _RARE_ of the entire family
care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed _RARE_ , _RARE_ fatigue , repeated crying _RARE_ , and short _RARE_ reflected the _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ with the _RARE_ situation
this was a family in crisis
compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and _RARE_ at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for _RARE_
_RARE_ experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday
anniversary of her father's death she poured out with _RARE_ tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral
_RARE_ own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had `` reached the crisis peak -- either the situation will give or we will break ''
and acceptance of Mrs. _RARE_ anger against the second baby soon _RARE_ her fears of _RARE_
her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents , when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , produced further relief of tension
joint interview Mr. and Mrs. B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger _RARE_ _RARE_ away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the _RARE_
, accurately _RARE_ the child's needs , not only respected them as worthy of his attention , but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the _RARE_ , saying , `` I have a big lap ; ; there is room for you , too , Johnnie ''
a variety of _RARE_ supports -- a calm but not too _RARE_ _RARE_ , referral for temporary economic aid , intelligent use of nursing care , _RARE_ to the _RARE_ _RARE_ for medical advice on the _RARE_ feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of _RARE_ pathological mechanisms
of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the _RARE_ _RARE_ mental health and social functioning
in the B. family , there must be an attempt to help the _RARE_ develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance
of awareness usually _RARE_ from deep but _RARE_ anxiety , often assuming the _RARE_ _RARE_ of `` not knowing '' or `` not caring ''
use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled _RARE_
, the approach is more active than _RARE_ , more _RARE_ than _RARE_
regression is inevitable , it is _RARE_ rather than encouraged so that the _RARE_ does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework _RARE_ of the _RARE_ model for _RARE_ therapy
an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential _RARE_ immediately , preferably within the first interview , by meeting the _RARE_ specific needs
usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension
interview must be therapeutic rather than purely _RARE_ in an _RARE_ sense
_RARE_ stage the worker must communicate confidence in the _RARE_ ability to deal with the problem
doing he _RARE_ offers the positive _RARE_ of hope as a kind of _RARE_ dynamic to _RARE_ feelings of _RARE_ and _RARE_ generally associated with the first stages of stress impact
the _RARE_ receives enough ego support to engage in _RARE_ efforts on his own behalf
is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation
_RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ phenomena such as _RARE_ regression , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , excessive use of denial , and _RARE_ guilt turned against the self
_RARE_ and some denial are not only necessary but healthy , the _RARE_ clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used , what healthy _RARE_ in _RARE_ adaptation are indicated , and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed
the family toward _RARE_ and away from _RARE_ responses , the worker uses _RARE_ focused casework techniques of specific emotional support , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ guidance
relatively short period of time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back and forth , between immediate external _RARE_ _RARE_ ( `` _RARE_ stress '' ) and the key , emotionally relevant issues ( `` underlying problem '' ) which are , often in a dramatic _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ by the crisis situation , and hence once again _RARE_ to resolution
is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the _RARE_ skill to _RARE_ them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic _RARE_
too , the _RARE_ clinical flexibility is necessary in _RARE_ _RARE_ carefully timed _RARE_ home visits , single and group office interviews , and appropriate telephone follow-up calls , if the worker is to be _RARE_ _RARE_ and if the predicted _RARE_ outcome is to be actually _RARE_ in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention
, in many cases , a variety of concrete social resources -- _RARE_ , day care , medical and financial aid -- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to _RARE_ the family in its individual and collective _RARE_ and _RARE_ efforts
critical stages , and only for sound diagnostic reasons , it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their _RARE_ behavior is to be _RARE_ rather than _RARE_
in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker ( in terms of his _RARE_ to leave the _RARE_ of his office and enter _RARE_ into the _RARE_ life ) , techniques of _RARE_ were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives
whatever the techniques used , a _RARE_ goal is common to all preventive casework service : to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to _RARE_ and use their ego _RARE_
an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : What place should brief , _RARE_ preventive casework _RARE_ in our total spectrum of services
first recognize our tendency to develop a _RARE_ of values , locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of seeing the services as part of a _RARE_ , each important in its own right
is perhaps as old as social casework itself
decades ago _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ a study of _RARE_ _RARE_ because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services
has been _RARE_ out in the experience of many _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ is neither a _RARE_ nor a _RARE_ experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work ''
casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended
are _RARE_ an _RARE_ of interest in the many formulations and preventive _RARE_ of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature
is _RARE_ finding that the length of treatment per _RARE_ is not a reliable indicator of successful outcome
a number of studies , the important _RARE_ are the nature and management of the _RARE_ anxiety as well as the _RARE_ of the helping person
, the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for _RARE_ relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance _RARE_ where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project
significance , too , is the _RARE_ that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent _RARE_ rate as compared with a rate of _RARE_ percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in _RARE_ operated child guidance services
refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance _RARE_ approached by the customary _RARE_ of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people
the approach which I have described are evident in the _RARE_ establishment of a helping relationship , quick _RARE_ of key issues , and the immediate _RARE_ of treatment plans as the essential _RARE_ in helping to further the _RARE_ _RARE_ efforts in dealing with the _RARE_ of inner and outer stresses
are many different possibilities for the _RARE_ of casework intervention , the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional _RARE_ all point up the importance of an immediate response to the _RARE_ initial need for help
programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period of time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible _RARE_ of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success
take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the _RARE_ that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can _RARE_ ) is another prominent feature in these efforts
in _RARE_ this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy '' but rather to encourage us to use the _RARE_ clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride
is obviously great need for continued _RARE_ with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary -- or perhaps , in some instances , primary -- level , the place of short-term intervention has already been _RARE_ by a number of investigators in a wide variety of _RARE_
for example , has emphasized the `` need for a broad spectrum of services , including very brief services in connection with critical situations ''
brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance
the _RARE_ of treatment resources and the _RARE_ persistent _RARE_ of mental health manpower force us to _RARE_ additional _RARE_ of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available -- and on a more effective basis to more people
in the meaning of _RARE_ as experienced by the _RARE_ of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a _RARE_ of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are _RARE_ social needs which should command the best efforts of _RARE_ in _RARE_ with community _RARE_
is already _RARE_ with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency _RARE_ ranging from the immediately practical to the _RARE_ _RARE_
in the immediate future , we will have to settle for _RARE_ efforts that fall short of _RARE_ models
with _RARE_ agencies , especially those that _RARE_ _RARE_ the traditional functions of family and child _RARE_ services , holds rich promise for the future
, child _RARE_ experience _RARE_ with cases in which the _RARE_ request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is _RARE_ linked with a fundamental _RARE_ problem of family relationships

and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling
the devices for tension management is _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study
geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in _RARE_
seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society
relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation
building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as _RARE_ for _RARE_ and _RARE_ illustrate this supportive relationship
remarks , `` In the internal pattern the chief reason for _RARE_ is to communicate liking , friendship , and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative _RARE_ to those who stand in _RARE_ relations ''

the status _RARE_ might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today
the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal _RARE_ for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war
World War 2 , there was a higher percentage of _RARE_ marriages than after World War 2

, as elements , refer to `` all criteria for _RARE_ the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system ''
of evaluation _RARE_ varying positive and negative _RARE_ or values to elements
and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population
evidence `` it may be _RARE_ that core - core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and females ; ; core - marginal marriages still belong in the category of _RARE_ unions ; ; and core - Negro marriages are _RARE_ for core members ''

of _RARE_ and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of _RARE_ about them

some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power , primarily the voluntary influence of _RARE_ power , has been exerted on _RARE_ in the system , particularly in regard to mate selection
seem to vary from family to family , depending somewhat on the core or marginal `` status '' of that family
size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls

members of the Brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the _RARE_ of the various families in the population
majority of the _RARE_ placed core families in the upper positions
_RARE_ a product of the evaluation process
standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system ''
increasing rate of _RARE_ marriages , the population has been able to sustain , at least to some degree , the consciousness of its intermediate status in society
extent the system can be considered a _RARE_ in which `` _RARE_ _RARE_ are determined by birth , by attributes such as sex or _RARE_ , which are _RARE_ or socially _RARE_ ''
of many in the population to the Indian background in their _RARE_ , and emphasis upon the fact that their _RARE_ had never been slaves , becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the _RARE_ of the intermediate status of the group in society

sanctions applied to core - Negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected _RARE_ to group norms
because of Church laws , lately more _RARE_ enforced , which _RARE_ the marriage of cousins closely related _RARE_ , a means of _RARE_ the goal of _RARE_ relations may be that of _RARE_ to _RARE_ unions
survey of available material indicates a high rate of _RARE_ _RARE_ occurring to parents who have a close _RARE_ relationship
comprehensive or master processes _RARE_ all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems
larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems
_RARE_ , consisting of relatively stable _RARE_ among its parts , includes : 1
various types , _RARE_ by _RARE_ norms

various types , within the larger system and within the _RARE_ 3
governing _RARE_ and roles


study of marriage patterns for this group , _RARE_ produces the structural system -- a system of _RARE_ -- which , in turn , maintains the system of _RARE_
various types have been found within this system
line can be considered a _RARE_
to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group
the _RARE_ of core - Negro marriages for core families , discussed above , would seem to act as a _RARE_ _RARE_ governing _RARE_ and roles
of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the _RARE_
it cannot be presumed , _RARE_ though the structure of the population seems , that there are not _RARE_ roles within the system
study _RARE_ to the theory of functional systems
_RARE_ that fertility is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the _RARE_ division of core families and marginal families is considered
functional problems of a social system are , to some extent , solved by the subsystems within this population
of geographical isolation and high fertility rates , _RARE_ can be _RARE_ and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained
to attain the goal of group solidarity and to _RARE_ tension , the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection , and the _RARE_ of members in groups _RARE_ acceptance of group controls
their intermediate position in the larger society , it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible '' , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate , distinct _RARE_ or system in society
above , where families are concentrated in larger numbers , group controls seem strongest and most effective
the social and _RARE_ environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of _RARE_ _RARE_
the necessary contact with the larger society , while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts
has to do with the _RARE_ of parts ''
of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values
placed by the Brandywine population , upon maintaining a certain _RARE_ , a certain separate _RARE_ identity , and therefore a certain separate social status , are important for the morale of the system
is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration , the higher the morale and solidarity , the better the system can _RARE_ the problems of the system
respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro _RARE_ within the same general _RARE_ , the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population
conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation
, higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population , allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity
can thereby _RARE_ itself and actually grow larger
Of particular utility in the analysis of the development , persistence , and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes
six such processes in his _RARE_

undoubtedly all six processes are _RARE_ within the whole social system and its subsystems , two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be _RARE_ out for particular emphasis

the process of communication , _RARE_ _RARE_ it as `` the process by which information , decisions , and _RARE_ are _RARE_ among _RARE_ and the ways in which knowledge , opinions , and attitudes are formed , or modified by interaction ''
be _RARE_ by means of the high _RARE_ within the larger community
is easier where segregated living and _RARE_ _RARE_ mark off a group from the rest of the community , as in the case of this population
the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation
Brandywine population is still _RARE_ rural , `` there are _RARE_ of a consistent and a _RARE_ significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities
to be an important factor in the _RARE_ of this group
is , however , an _RARE_
realistic analysis must take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the _RARE_ area are , in general , less segregated _RARE_ than group members in rural areas
urban area , in other words , they , unlike some urban _RARE_ groups , do not concentrate in ghetto _RARE_
toward _RARE_ are slight or _RARE_ , and _RARE_ behavior in mate selection _RARE_ few if any social sanctions
a setting social contacts and _RARE_ are likely to be _RARE_ , resulting in a change of values and , almost necessarily , in mate selection behavior
extent that urban life contributes to the _RARE_ of the group patterns of residential isolation , to that extent it contributes directly to increased _RARE_ ''

of social control is _RARE_ _RARE_ as sanctions play a part in the _RARE_ behavior , as well as the _RARE_ behavior
of this social control , _RARE_ is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group
this population indicate that _RARE_ seems to be _RARE_ by _RARE_ from the group

an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society
divided though this tradition may be , it is an important part of the social and cultural _RARE_ of the group , and acts as a means of _RARE_ , particularly for members of the rural community
of Indian _RARE_ and `` free '' status during the days of slavery , are important _RARE_ made by members of the group

induced social _RARE_ resulting from common norms and values _RARE_ by members of the group '' is _RARE_ in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of _RARE_
of boundary maintenance _RARE_ and _RARE_ the social system or subsystems , and the characteristic interaction is maintained
threat of _RARE_ on the system increases , the `` probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases ''
rate pattern would seem to be a function , though a _RARE_ one , of the process of maintaining the boundary
boundary maintenance may be achieved , for example , by _RARE_ a higher _RARE_ or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern
external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that _RARE_ the group to survive in its environment
maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social , as is the _RARE_ for _RARE_

maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group , _RARE_ _RARE_ is defined `` as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is _RARE_ in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit
_RARE_ issued in 1910 , two years after the _RARE_ government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by _RARE_
along this line were issued in _RARE_ and _RARE_
a continuous registration of the whole _RARE_ population was instituted by _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ compilation of these records was ordered
procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the _RARE_ _RARE_
set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time
system was again reviewed and _RARE_ in _RARE_
for its administration rested with a division of the _RARE_ government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ et de _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , Af _RARE_ , Af _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ )
, the _RARE_ and their _RARE_ , were held responsible for maintaining the _RARE_ of _RARE_ persons within their _RARE_ , under the general supervision of district officials
officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to _RARE_ the annual _RARE_ of demographic statistics
require the _RARE_ of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( _RARE_ )

are used for males and females , and a corner is _RARE_ from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach _RARE_
quick count could be made at any time , even by an _RARE_ clerk , of the number of registered persons in four _RARE_ classes
cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments , _RARE_ , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded
cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females

card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons
of permanent _RARE_ are , in theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence
the registration of _RARE_ and _RARE_ by nearest relatives was made _RARE_ in most regions
registered persons in four _RARE_ classes were counted each year
, demographic inquiries , _RARE_ involving field investigations , were conducted in selected minor divisions ( _RARE_ ) containing about 3 percent of the total population
of these inquiries were used to adjust _RARE_ of data from the _RARE_ and to provide various ratios and rates by districts , including birth and death rates , general fertility rates , distributions by _RARE_ status , fertility of _RARE_ separately in _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_
to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials , _RARE_ as representative of a larger population
the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population
, in theory , is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions of African life
places a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already _RARE_ in other ways ) of a widely dispersed , poor and largely _RARE_ population
program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies
was not well _RARE_ to conditions of life in urban centers
between _RARE_ ( de _RARE_ ) and present ( de _RARE_ ) population was not clearly defined
results are subject to considerable confusion
tended to break down during the war , but was _RARE_ ; ; it had reached the _RARE_ level of efficiency by 1951
of the _RARE_ in this system , the figures on total population during the late _RARE_ and again in the early _RARE_ seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate _RARE_
information on the _RARE_ of population was often quite _RARE_
system , with minor _RARE_ , was developed in Ruanda-Urundi under _RARE_ administration
it seems that useful _RARE_ of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late _RARE_ and early post-war periods
more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of _RARE_ in _RARE_ Africa
of strong independent agencies , established in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conducted large medical , social , educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi
of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Du Congo _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) has special interest with respect to _RARE_
accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from _RARE_ persons in 1941 to _RARE_ in 1956 in the _RARE_ District and adjacent areas east of _RARE_
from 1941 on , its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and , as its primary objective , the _RARE_ of major diseases
are reported each year in its _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ )
investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas
, or partially independent agencies , have promoted investigations on _RARE_ directly or indirectly related to _RARE_
vary widely in scope and precision
La _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) has sponsored _RARE_ field investigations and has _RARE_ closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development of its official statistics
investigation of the characteristics of _RARE_ and prospective _RARE_ in Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J. J. _RARE_ , former Director of the Social Science branch of _RARE_ , now a _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ Du Congo _RARE_ et Du Ruanda-Urundi
completed _RARE_ with 20 items ( collected by _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ ) have been _RARE_
are now being analyzed
been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs
organizations of both countries , which maintain administrative services throughout the _RARE_ , retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information
the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics
De La _RARE_ ( A. _RARE_ , Director ) was formed under _RARE_ in the Congo , to work in close _RARE_ with the Section _RARE_ of the _RARE_ General
for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central _RARE_ Office
demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by _RARE_ _RARE_ , a member of the _RARE_ staff , though the inquiry was carried out under the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory
of the _RARE_ staff ( E. _RARE_ De _RARE_ ) was recently _RARE_ to _RARE_ with _RARE_ in the development of demographic statistics in this territory
of sampling _RARE_ in Ruanda-Urundi ( 1952 ) and in the Congo ( 1955 - _RARE_ ) were major advances
deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into operation later than the other
nature of the _RARE_ in the Congo was not emphasized in the official _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ , previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative _RARE_ , was used for the new investigations
the differences in procedure are fundamental
as follows : ( 1 ) field work procedures
were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of _RARE_ African investigators ( three teams , each working in two _RARE_ )
carried out the same operations _RARE_ in different areas
) nature of the sample
in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory , so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within _RARE_ limits
, scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling
of the various districts , or other major divisions , were _RARE_ by type of community ( rural , urban , mixed ) and , where appropriate , by _RARE_ _RARE_ and by type of economy
( _RARE_ in rural areas , houses in cities ) were drawn _RARE_ within these _RARE_
) size of the sample
ratios were applied under different conditions
were _RARE_ in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas
percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries
) questions and _RARE_
, _RARE_ , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country
obtained , separately , on three classes of persons : ( A ) _RARE_ , present ; ; ( B ) _RARE_ , absent ; ; and ( C ) visitors
reports , summary results are given for both the de _RARE_ ( A and C ) and de _RARE_ ( A and B ) _RARE_ ; ; but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de _RARE_ population ( or , in some districts , only the de _RARE_ population )
represent , in effect , a shift from ( 1 ) an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to ( 2 ) a systematic sampling census of the whole African population
registration system still has important functions
local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations
a frame for the sampling census
provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually _RARE_ force ( though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this source in the near future )
still used in making current population estimates in _RARE_ years , though the value of these estimates is open to question
it may have certain very important , less obvious values
the _RARE_ may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and supplementary information ( such as records of _RARE_ status ) for many others
of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries
it may be possible to estimate the error due to _RARE_ in method ( as distinguished from sampling error ) in each of these sources , on such subjects as fertility , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction
sampling census in the Congo extended over a _RARE_ period , 1955 - _RARE_ ; ; the results were still being processed in 1959
planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more _RARE_
proposed that in the future complete sampling _RARE_ be carried out at _RARE_ intervals
issued on the sampling census , 1955 - _RARE_ , in various areas run as follows ( using only the French and _RARE_ corresponding _RARE_ _RARE_ )
contains preliminary notes and 35 tables
in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued
reports will be followed , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods
evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively _RARE_ the married students in his functional classes
end of the _RARE_ work , he _RARE_ every married class member at great length
, as he had suspected , a general _RARE_ that perhaps over half of the present _RARE_ designed course was not really functional for these students
all admitted that the `` _RARE_ '' was not altogether lost
own words , it had _RARE_ them to get a _RARE_ picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some _RARE_ on why certain _RARE_ appeared from time to time
, they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some `` _RARE_ '' study ; ; but they all _RARE_ to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent
them felt a _RARE_ need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course
were doubtful about the _RARE_ of an exclusive section for married students
of them expressed it , `` It has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these _RARE_ people
now better see just what processes _RARE_ certain actions from me in the past
been in an _RARE_ section I would have missed this , and I believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me ''
and others similar to it , would seem to indicate a possible _RARE_ for continuing the status _RARE_
weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction
the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married -- that is , _RARE_ : `` marriage ''
not mean that married students could not _RARE_ in other `` mixed '' sections , and some of them , largely because of _RARE_ difficulties , did
those already married could _RARE_ in this one section
, two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted
) The regular sections do not allow _RARE_ ; ; this one did
was _RARE_ on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married _RARE_ women on our campus never become _RARE_
them appear to drop out , for one reason or another
_RARE_ students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it
subsequently been _RARE_ by the experience
) _RARE_ were encouraged
regular sections they have always been more or less _RARE_
has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an _RARE_ to do the work more effectively
_RARE_ do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students
this one section we _RARE_ _RARE_

particular reason , other than that the writer felt it might -- just might -- encourage both _RARE_ to be in _RARE_
the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum , especially in the various engineering fields , with few _RARE_ till the senior year
it needs to be noted that because _RARE_ were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week , until at last it _RARE_ to such proportions that this `` free '' _RARE_ policy had to be _RARE_
, we began to get `` visitors '' to class
class represented quite a variety of students
from a _RARE_ woman , just married , through the various academic growth stages , including one _RARE_ student , to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended
from those with no children , through students in various stages of _RARE_ , to one _RARE_ male with four children , three of whom were _RARE_
from two women members who had experienced _RARE_ _RARE_ to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive
_RARE_ at this point and speculate that if it is `` wise '' to create special sections for special status , then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage , and one for _RARE_ men with _RARE_ children , and so on
these _RARE_ may have some merit , others are somewhat ambiguous
who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of _RARE_ relationships is different in marriage than in a _RARE_ situation
began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place
it clear from the beginning that this was the _RARE_ opportunity , and that the future _RARE_ of such groups _RARE_ on favorable results from this one
build a framework of academic `` _RARE_ '' , and one which did not _RARE_ upon the `` sacred _RARE_ '' of any other existing campus course
to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods , nor a course in how to raise children
have courses covering those problems , and so on
that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible
committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and _RARE_ the direction and pace the class was taking
, being _RARE_ through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students , did insist on there being included some `` _RARE_ '' material
greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes : `` So we are married -- now how do we make the best of it ''
How do we _RARE_ our already fine marriage ''
used , as with all sections , but with one big difference
, _RARE_ , _RARE_ no films
are all either _RARE_ or _RARE_ , the _RARE_ dates for their use have to be far in advance
never knew from week to week just where the section might be
, the steering committee might announce that the group felt a _RARE_ under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it _RARE_
writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision -- after , of course , pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an _RARE_ one
films seen as they came in ( coordinated for the regular sections ) , were often out of context
the writer has never experienced such _RARE_ of discussion after film _RARE_
did not become known to the writer for some time , a _RARE_ group had _RARE_ up within the class
to meet in the _RARE_ and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class
few students this group gradually increased to include over _RARE_ of those officially enrolled in the class , and many _RARE_ as well
although only a few of the students were _RARE_ _RARE_ with each other in the beginning , most reported that when the semester ended their _RARE_ and _RARE_ campus _RARE_ were with members of that class
, they often _RARE_ their social activities to include class members previously unknown
reading reports were handled just as in the other sections , the major difference being that there was a _RARE_ deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group
, although they might read various articles in popular magazines , more often chose to report on articles found in the _RARE_
to the noticeable difference in outside articles , there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read
high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other _RARE_ which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest
writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as a matter of fact , in those who were continuing in `` single sections '' , he can only conclude that there must have been something `` _RARE_ '' within the specific group which caused this to occur
main , this course took the following _RARE_ high roads
) A great deal of time was spent on processes for _RARE_ _RARE_ differences
not a search for a `` magic formula '' , but rather an examination of basic principles _RARE_ especially to all types of communication in marriage
, it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive _RARE_
the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to ( 2 ) , _RARE_ adjustment areas , such as sex , _RARE_ , religion , finance , and so on
they proceeded to ( 3 ) These same areas in relation to their own future family life stages , developing these to the extent of _RARE_ various _RARE_ which could be expected to _RARE_ them at some time or other
example of this last _RARE_ , there were some lengthy discussions centered around _RARE_
were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the _RARE_ of living with the _RARE_ afterward , but the possible death of one's own _RARE_ was not _RARE_
course , one member has lost her husband
not a particularly _RARE_ or unexpected thing -- it was previously known to her that it might happen
when was an unknown , and of course the longer it did not happen , the stronger her wish and belief that it might not
_RARE_ this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis
class members brought questions from their _RARE_ at home
often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them
a personal _RARE_ to class discussions and participation
reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely _RARE_
sensed a much _RARE_ and more _RARE_ discussion , especially of this one area , than ever before
certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that _RARE_ , as a _RARE_ , is not nearly so essential for a _RARE_ female sexual experience as most males might think
probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again
other hand , the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always _RARE_ it with love as most women seem to do
_RARE_ area it could be readily observed that all felt _RARE_ to discuss things than students had previously in `` mixed '' _RARE_ status sections
was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent
other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine _RARE_ discussions about the feelings of both _RARE_ during various stages of _RARE_
a particularly _RARE_ opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of _RARE_ was represented , from a _RARE_ couple to and including every _RARE_
, we had one birth before the end of the course , and another student had to take the final _RARE_ a week early , just to be on the safe side
also one spontaneous _RARE_ during the semester
is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` _RARE_ '' experience
predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would _RARE_ to more liberal , _RARE_ reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their _RARE_ about taking chances
true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action
as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic
inventories
personality inventories ( _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects
the same subjects who were given the _RARE_ test
had been made concerning factors R , N , I and _RARE_ on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were _RARE_ as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity
_RARE_ between the two groups at less than the _RARE_ level ( Af )
had been made about the difference in security or _RARE_ between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not
had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure '' _RARE_ and `` secure '' _RARE_ being used as the groups for comparative personality studies
predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the `` _RARE_ '' factor
the subjects in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups ( as defined for purposes of the personality studies ) were compared with those subjects who shifted in _RARE_ 3 , or 4
test on these two groups , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , gave a `` _RARE_ '' value of _RARE_ which is significant on the _RARE_ test at the level
differences _RARE_ differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study
( 11 subjects ) gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon
_RARE_ ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the _RARE_ of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration
_RARE_ ( 10 subjects ) who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were _RARE_ as to the _RARE_ of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction
latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred
changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax
( _RARE_ ) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm , what that something was , and also were given a demonstration
( _RARE_ ) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal _RARE_ reaction which some people showed while others did not
time was it implied by the _RARE_ that the _RARE_ initial reaction was _RARE_
were only given information about other possibilities of `` normal '' reaction
responded with an arm-elevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion
was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show _RARE_ must be _RARE_ it
implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried
Kohnstamm reactivity in _RARE_ 1 ( ( the naive state ) is not adequately explained by such a concept as _RARE_ ( if _RARE_ is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal _RARE_ )
way , either _RARE_ or _RARE_ , did the _RARE_ indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of _RARE_ to the voluntary contraction
when the _RARE_ did _RARE_ those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed , the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were _RARE_ in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation
to give an arm-elevation
_RARE_ would have to be _RARE_ to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive _RARE_ and yet _RARE_ their naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion
the reaction of the subject in such a way as to _RARE_ to his own expectations of the outcome ( i.e. , that the _RARE_ is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the _RARE_ apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) _RARE_ of the phenomenon despite _RARE_ of something else happening ( e.g. , of becoming _RARE_ and maybe falling , an expectation _RARE_ _RARE_ by one of the subjects )
_RARE_ also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they gave
were told that there were some normal people who _RARE_ differently than they had , they were also informed that there were other _RARE_ who _RARE_ as they had
no implication made that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of _RARE_
_RARE_ explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less _RARE_ and to relax , since any reaction seemed _RARE_ to the _RARE_ as `` normal ''
state , _RARE_ 1 , , could therefore be viewed as an _RARE_ one for _RARE_ of the subjects in this study
not free to be themselves in this situation , an _RARE_ one , where there was an _RARE_ of their reactions and they had no guide for _RARE_ behavior
relax , i.e. , to be `` spontaneous '' , and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have , was not sufficiently _RARE_ until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given
conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from _RARE_ to _RARE_ in Kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to _RARE_ an attitude in the subject which _RARE_ him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior
succeeded in changing _RARE_ to _RARE_ quite _RARE_ in one pilot subject ( the only one with whom this technique was tried )
, who has been undergoing _RARE_ _RARE_ for five years , did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four _RARE_ conditions used in this experiment while sober
drinks containing alcohol , her arm flew upward very freely
evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement
herself as having the same kind of `` _RARE_ '' feeling as she had once experienced under _RARE_
her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily _RARE_ from her the controls which she felt so _RARE_ necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls
attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and _RARE_ as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it
interpretations were given by the subjects _RARE_ when they were told that there were people who _RARE_ differently than they had
subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control
its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors
that they too could _RARE_ the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction
those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors -- an _RARE_ to _RARE_ control _RARE_
_RARE_ asked ( after her arm had finally _RARE_ ) , `` Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before ''
that her arm did not go up at first `` because I wouldn't let it ; ; I thought it wasn't supposed to ''
was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first
felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial , but had _RARE_ prevented it from so doing
_RARE_ of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax ''
that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up , she _RARE_ , `` I don't see how they can prevent it ''
to this _RARE_ explanation for _RARE_ given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects , the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an _RARE_ hypothesis to explain _RARE_
that they were _RARE_ as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level
discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in _RARE_ in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects ; ; but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to _RARE_ with _RARE_
subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows : `` You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to happen ''
described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she _RARE_ control
she was able to relax and yield to the moment
our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less _RARE_ about _RARE_ control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; ; that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be _RARE_ rather than _RARE_
our belief that this readiness to _RARE_ some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below
this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor
The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be _RARE_ to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world
a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained _RARE_ on the _RARE_
in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going _RARE_
that their _RARE_ experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the _RARE_ _RARE_
were not so bound by past experience and _RARE_ as to deny their immediate _RARE_ and to be _RARE_ by their knowledge of what the experience should be
in _RARE_ by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects , after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions , suggests that their _RARE_ and _RARE_ is associated with their general mode of _RARE_ to strange or unknown situations
able to experience at first , in terms of past _RARE_
as to the various possibilities of normal reactions , they were then able to experience the _RARE_ of the present
be _RARE_ that these subjects are _RARE_ afraid of being wrong ; ; that they perceive new internal and _RARE_ situations as `` threatening '' until they are tested and proved otherwise
interpretations that have been given are _RARE_ only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the _RARE_ illusion
_RARE_ status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method
schools were in an industrial city , with _RARE_ _RARE_ houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather _RARE_ section of middle-class homes
schools were in a large suburban community , _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ class , but _RARE_ by an industrial area
to equate the samples on _RARE_ status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of _RARE_ status of the _RARE_
and guidance workers made ratings of the various _RARE_ and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas
scale was developed for _RARE_ school _RARE_ from these data
of children in each city were drawn from _RARE_ and _RARE_ class _RARE_
differences in _RARE_ and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement
_RARE_ children were chosen as subjects for this study
of sample selection only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire _RARE_ population in each school system
for this study were _RARE_ selected from _RARE_ areas of the distribution , _RARE_ as _RARE_ , _RARE_ medium , and _RARE_ _RARE_
reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total _RARE_ school population were considered _RARE_ for the purposes of sample selection
at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system
sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores
in twelve unstructured schools furnished _RARE_ cases , _RARE_ boys and _RARE_ girls
in three structured schools furnished _RARE_ cases , _RARE_ boys and _RARE_ girls
necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools
assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation
of compulsivity An interview schedule of _RARE_ questions and a _RARE_ questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home
was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe _RARE_ toward _RARE_ in demands upon self and others , _RARE_ _RARE_ to rules , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and need for certainty
were instructed not to suggest answers and , as much as possible , to record the _RARE_ actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations
scale of compulsivity was constructed by first _RARE_ the interview records , _RARE_ all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records
were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual _RARE_ recorded and _RARE_ weight values to each type of behavior that was _RARE_ from the discovered norms
high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or _RARE_ in situations where there was lack of organization or _RARE_ to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals
compulsive child was one who appeared relatively _RARE_ about such matters
, the following statement was _RARE_ low in compulsivity , `` She's naturally quite neat about things , but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets _RARE_
_RARE_ it up very well when I _RARE_ her ''
anxiety _RARE_ , et al revised the Taylor _RARE_ _RARE_ for use with children
_RARE_ was _RARE_ from the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , with item selection based upon clinical _RARE_ of anxiety
much research evidence to _RARE_ the use of the instrument in _RARE_ individuals who are likely to _RARE_ anxiety in varying degrees
_RARE_ work with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ , et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale
Taylor _RARE_ was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by _RARE_ trained workers who established _RARE_ and _RARE_ the children in reading the items
_RARE_ to compulsivity The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity
ratings yield a correlation of , which is not significantly different from zero ; ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics
, compulsive behavior is a way of _RARE_ anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the _RARE_ defenses are not sufficient to _RARE_ the amount of anxiety they suffer
of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later
In the primary grades , reading _RARE_ almost every aspect of school progress , and the _RARE_ early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively _RARE_ throughout the following years
_RARE_ measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself
interaction effect should , if _RARE_ , extend its influence over all academic achievement
_RARE_ _RARE_ , Form _RARE_ , was administered by classroom teachers , consisting of a _RARE_ of six _RARE_ : _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_
these _RARE_ involve reading except _RARE_ _RARE_
stated in _RARE_ on a national _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ was used in data analysis in this study
_RARE_ _RARE_ For Children was administered to each sample _RARE_ child by a clinical worker
of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a _RARE_ fact ( in this case , Af ) ; ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor
score used in the statistical analysis is an index of _RARE_ or _RARE_
the discrepancy between the actual _RARE_ achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the _RARE_
, on the basis of the regression equation , a child with an _RARE_ of _RARE_ in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of _RARE_ ( grade equivalent )
child with an _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in achievement , his discrepancy score would be , representing of one year of _RARE_
with an _RARE_ of _RARE_ would be expected to earn an achievement test score of _RARE_
a child _RARE_ _RARE_ , his discrepancy score would be _RARE_ , representing of one year of _RARE_
manner , the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables
of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable
_RARE_ the mean achievement scores of each _RARE_ _RARE_
all , as we had _RARE_ , the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better ( Af ) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools
be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high compulsive children do better ( Af )
difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school
of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case , at the level
had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high _RARE_ within the schools where the _RARE_ method is used in beginning reading _RARE_ favorably with that of the low _RARE_
achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant
that _RARE_ in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of _RARE_ in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to _RARE_ the _RARE_ rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment
interesting to note that medium _RARE_ in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower )
compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure
is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child _RARE_ those elements of each lesson that aid him in _RARE_ his work
by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success
interaction of anxiety and teaching methods The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the _RARE_ of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4
is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group
, the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( Af ) than those in the structured schools
effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores
anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( Af ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom
striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked _RARE_ in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools
the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that _RARE_ _RARE_ for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment
that such threat is _RARE_ in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or _RARE_ these children exhibit
with high anxiety may first direct his _RARE_ energy toward achievement , but because his _RARE_ severely _RARE_ the _RARE_ of discrimination and _RARE_ of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem
the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the _RARE_ in performance is pronounced
with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination
symbols he is asked to learn are simple
earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his _RARE_ of simple elements
the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved
time the child first _RARE_ the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words
challenge in the structured setting _RARE_ an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an _RARE_ state without becoming confused or _RARE_
al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the _RARE_ situation , and that his performance will be _RARE_ unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher
present study was not a direct _RARE_ of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion
in the two school systems studied here , _RARE_ the teachers in the structured schools to be more _RARE_ and _RARE_ , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was _RARE_ to be more supporting and accepting
highly anxious child suffered a tremendous _RARE_ only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting
means the evaluation of _RARE_ , the comparative ratings of parts , the _RARE_ of the meaning of isolated elements
roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and _RARE_ good parts
Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals
be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals
: a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying
us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving _RARE_ of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis
keep in mind that many of the exciting _RARE_ of roleplaying are largely _RARE_ and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas
president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business
_RARE_ references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of _RARE_ due to _RARE_ or _RARE_ performance was too high
his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven _RARE_
offered as a solution -- and the procedure worked as follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out
of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , _RARE_ their references , _RARE_ them , asking them to be tried out , he told them he would prefer to test them
was to enter the testing room , carrying a suitcase of samples
was to read a sheet containing a description of the product
testing room he was to make , _RARE_ , three _RARE_ to three different people
testing room , three of the veteran salesmen served as _RARE_
the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a _RARE_ manner
told to purchase material if he felt like it
came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other _RARE_
presentation , the _RARE_ wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; ; and so did the observers consisting of the president , three of his salesmen and a _RARE_
were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon
was repeated one day a month for four months
average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three
of the firm , _RARE_ expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped _RARE_ while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent
for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers
, in a sense , `` tried out '' in realistic situations
point of view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated -- and they got a meal out of it as well as some _RARE_ into their _RARE_
of roleplaying for evaluation _RARE_ how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special _RARE_ during the daily course of work
of _RARE_ was opened in a large office and an _RARE_ was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher _RARE_ and slightly higher salary than _RARE_ and _RARE_ positions
were generally familiar with the work of the _RARE_
end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one at a time , asked them to sit behind the _RARE_ desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the _RARE_ with a number of _RARE_ and for a number of purposes
was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not only as the director , but as the _RARE_ and the _RARE_
his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat _RARE_ and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of _RARE_ , showing wit , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day
considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning
in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure
had been made the works manager of a firm , _RARE_ a retired employee who had been considered _RARE_ successful
had more than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` _RARE_ ''
he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position
to _RARE_ everyone
of personnel went up , production dropped , and morale was _RARE_ reduced
fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him
insistence of his own _RARE_ -- the president of the firm -- he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders
a number of typical situations before observers , other _RARE_ who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong
with efficiency , he was _RARE_ in _RARE_ people who made _RARE_ , _RARE_ them to too great an extent
not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way -- which was the only right way
group of managers explained , in great detail , a number of human relations errors that he made
one , these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors
his behavior , and _RARE_ it
to change his approach , and instead he attacked high and low -- the officials for their not backing him , and _RARE_ for their _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
_RARE_ , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good
say that his problem was _RARE_ but that he refused treatment
turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it
say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; ; or we may say that his attitude was _RARE_ , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others
case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made over
may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis
course for _RARE_ operators , a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being _RARE_ successful as a store manager , found that in _RARE_ other managers he was having a difficult time
some typical situations before a jury of his _RARE_ he showed some characteristics _RARE_ as _RARE_
told he _RARE_ , for example , a sense of _RARE_ -- and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers , aren't I ''
_RARE_ for his _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and he answered : `` I am not working to become popular ''
_RARE_ for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered : `` I have to make decisions
job ''
, as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and _RARE_ himself
in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways
step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms
was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem
helped _RARE_ a check list of the district _RARE_ errors by asking various observers to write out sentences _RARE_ on the _RARE_ they felt he made
were then collected and written on a _RARE_ , _RARE_ similar ideas
were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors
asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; ; and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain
sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up , and the director wrote the numbers on the _RARE_
were made during the voting
looked as follows : Af
eight of these eighteen statements , which received at least _RARE_ of the votes , were _RARE_ to form an analysis _RARE_ for the particular manager , and when this particular manager _RARE_ in other situations , the members checked any items that appeared
the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions , they were rather lengthy ( about twenty minutes ) , the situations were _RARE_ described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new _RARE_ were brought on the scene unexpectedly , and the _RARE_ were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously _RARE_
session , the check marks were _RARE_ up and _RARE_ , and in this way the _RARE_ progress was _RARE_
life we learn to play our roles and we `` _RARE_ '' into patterns which become so _RARE_ that we are not really aware of what we do
see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves
what we do is the first step for improvement
the validity of the judgments of others is the second step
to change is the third step
new procedures under guided supervision and with constant _RARE_ is the fourth step
these new ways in daily life is the last step
for analysis follows these general steps leading to training
_RARE_ situation is set up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation
see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a _RARE_ fashion
is more `` _RARE_ '' -- or true -- than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning
for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure
, _RARE_ training the objective of this chapter is to _RARE_ the _RARE_ between _RARE_ theory and other training concepts
, the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed
will be to provide the reader with an _RARE_ _RARE_ to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area
for _RARE_ this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are _RARE_

theory is unique and relatively new
not easy for the therapist to _RARE_ when , in the patient's _RARE_ , an _RARE_ has appeared and is holding _RARE_
to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his _RARE_ suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , _RARE_
of his words may _RARE_ back into _RARE_ repetition , as if a _RARE_ needle were stuck in one _RARE_ ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously _RARE_ some _RARE_ _RARE_ , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him
woman often became _RARE_ in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of _RARE_ , during which , despite her _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her
_RARE_ became more _RARE_ , and more sharply _RARE_ from her _RARE_ behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny ''
I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her _RARE_ , in their distant _RARE_
realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she _RARE_ my hunch
phase in the therapy , when a _RARE_ _RARE_ began to emerge more and more upon the _RARE_ scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me ''
_RARE_ no further _RARE_ from her about this ; ; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a _RARE_ _RARE_ tone , `` Your father _RARE_ you ''
I at first _RARE_ this _RARE_ intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such _RARE_ conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased
replied , coldly , `` If you _RARE_ me , why don't you say so , directly ''
confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make
occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you ''
agreed that this had been the case
, now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her
been an _RARE_ powerful _RARE_ was now , despite its continuing charge of energy _RARE_ to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this _RARE_ mother was like
this woman had been so filled with a _RARE_ variety of _RARE_ that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a _RARE_ as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would _RARE_ in various kinds of voice
less _RARE_ hebephrenic patient of mine , who used to often _RARE_ herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door -- as I would find on passing by , between our sessions -- for all the world like two persons , a _RARE_ mother and a _RARE_ child
for the therapist to _RARE_ are those instances in which the patient is _RARE_ an _RARE_ _RARE_ to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly _RARE_
found , time and again , that some bit of particularly _RARE_ and _RARE_ behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; ; and only when I can _RARE_ this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a _RARE_ _RARE_ aspect of the patient's behavior
, one hebephrenic man used to _RARE_ me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly _RARE_ comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You're welcome '' , in a _RARE_ _RARE_ fashion -- as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure to _RARE_ a _RARE_ grateful , `` thank you '' to him at the end of each session
became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my _RARE_ to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his _RARE_ , `` You're welcome '' , was very accurately _RARE_ an element of _RARE_ _RARE_ which had been present in my own _RARE_ , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had _RARE_ him _RARE_ with the _RARE_ note , each time , that the _RARE_ Christ would be _RARE_ to _RARE_ this _RARE_ to the poor _RARE_ again on the _RARE_
, a _RARE_ woman , for many months _RARE_ not only me but the _RARE_ and her fellow patients by _RARE_ _RARE_ as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met
on her part _RARE_ only after I had come to see the _RARE_ close similarity between , on the one hand , her arranging the _RARE_ of the common living room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others , and on the other hand , my own coming _RARE_ into her room despite her persistent and _RARE_ objections , bringing my big easy chair with me , usually _RARE_ the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and _RARE_ myself down in my chair -- in short , _RARE_ as if I owned her room


variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their _RARE_ expression , to some _RARE_ _RARE_ verbal or _RARE_ statement
, for example , that a _RARE_ and _RARE_ verbal expression , seeming at first to be a mere hollow _RARE_ , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most _RARE_ of meanings
anything , it is the _RARE_ _RARE_ sensing of these _RARE_ meanings in the _RARE_ which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a _RARE_ deck of cards , on _RARE_ occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together
assume , of course , that all these _RARE_ meanings were inherent in the _RARE_ at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later on when the _RARE_ was _RARE_ ; ; probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a _RARE_ , _RARE_ mode of expression -- and no , or but a few , other _RARE_ _RARE_ , as yet -- being there , available for the patient's use , as _RARE_ emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months
is true that the therapist can sense , when he _RARE_ this _RARE_ , that there are at this moment many emotional _RARE_ at work in it , a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ voices which have yet to become clearly _RARE_ from one another
is not a verbal _RARE_ -- a `` How are you now ''
`` I want to go home '' , or whatever -- but a _RARE_ one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one _RARE_ meaning
man used to give a _RARE_ wave of his hand a number of times during his _RARE_ hours with his therapist
therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill -- _RARE_ or farewell ''
patient replied , `` Both , _RARE_ -- two in one ''
the possible forms of _RARE_ expression , that which seems best to give release , and _RARE_ expression , to complex and _RARE_ feelings is laughter
no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely _RARE_ of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter -- laughter which now makes one feel _RARE_ or hated , which now makes one feel like _RARE_ , or which now gives one a glimpse of the _RARE_ and empty _RARE_ of man's despair ; ; and which , more often than all these , _RARE_ a _RARE_ of feelings which could in no way be _RARE_ by any number of words , words which are so unlike this _RARE_ in being formed and discrete from one another
much less full extent , the hebephrenic _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ has a comparable _RARE_ function ; ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private _RARE_ over of the possible meaning of a _RARE_ , or the passage of _RARE_ , not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to _RARE_ , but also because he _RARE_ that even these _RARE_ sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from time to time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words
have been _RARE_ , in the schizophrenic -- and perhaps also in the dreams of the _RARE_ ; ; this is a question which I have no wish to take up -- _RARE_ is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well _RARE_ out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well _RARE_ from one another
_RARE_ and _RARE_ , in their description of the _RARE_ of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard to _RARE_ , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
experience , a great many of the patient's more _RARE_ verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become _RARE_ from _RARE_ meanings in his subjective experience
may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some _RARE_ , _RARE_ reference to _RARE_ events on the _RARE_ scene
for example , a _RARE_ woman's _RARE_ _RARE_ , in the session , about the _RARE_ curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a _RARE_ characteristic of _RARE_ human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was _RARE_ _RARE_ at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was
equally often , a _RARE_ , _RARE_ statement may consist , with its _RARE_ _RARE_ , in a form of poetry -- may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a _RARE_ expression : a _RARE_ , a smile , an _RARE_ , or some other symbolic mode of speaking
hidden meanings the patient himself is , more often than not , entirely unaware
experience may be a remarkably _RARE_ one
women _RARE_ to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; ; _RARE_ , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic communication , includes mention of similar clinical material
schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been _RARE_ , in a most _RARE_ fashion , during session after session with me , were like great _RARE_ of almost _RARE_ solid matter up in the air above him ; ; as he spoke I was reminded of the great _RARE_ of _RARE_ which are swung , high in the air , from a _RARE_ _RARE_
linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the _RARE_ contents around _RARE_ , stems , _RARE_ , etc.
reduction in the _RARE_ of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly _RARE_ language such as Russian
the reduction in size is less striking
requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be _RARE_ into a description of the particular word
scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file
the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis
the application of certain _RARE_ techniques as a solution to the problem
, we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of _RARE_ characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ; occurrence -- an instance of a form in text
a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text
this by _RARE_ a list of text forms as text is read by the computer
scheme , based on the _RARE_ of forms , provides an economical way to _RARE_ this text-form list
found to match forms in the text list are marked
in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; ; dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text
information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process -- the grammatical description for _RARE_ determination , _RARE_ information for semantic analysis , and _RARE_ _RARE_ for output construction
is a form dictionary , at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries
the dictionary is divided into at least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that _RARE_ to these forms
detailed description of dictionary operations -- text lookup and dictionary _RARE_ -- gives a _RARE_ picture
, as we will describe it , consists of three steps
is _RARE_ a list of text forms , _RARE_ an information cell to each , and _RARE_ text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence
step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the _RARE_ are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list ; ; cells in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ region are reserved as information cells for text forms
occurrence Af is isolated during text reading , a random memory address Af , the address of a cell in the _RARE_ , is computed from the form of Af
_RARE_ the form of Af
Af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of Af
itself is stored in the next available cells of the _RARE_ , beginning in cell Af
Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af ; ; the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence
continues with the next occurrence
assume that Af is identical to the form of an occurrence Af which preceded Af in the text
situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af
was assigned as the information cell for Af , the routine can _RARE_ that Af is identical to Af by _RARE_ Af with the form stored at location Af
Af is stored in the cell Af
as in this case , the two forms match , the address Af is saved to represent the occurrence Af
continues with the next occurrence
situation is possible
for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form
when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the _RARE_ , a chain of information cells must be created to _RARE_ the forms , one cell in the chain for each form
leads to an address Af that is equal to the address computed from Af , even though Af does not match Af , the chain of information cells is extended from Af by _RARE_ the address of the next available cell in the _RARE_ , Af , in Af
Af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of Af
cell can be added by _RARE_ the address of another _RARE_ in Af ; ; similarly , as many cells are added as are required
cell in the chain contains the address of the _RARE_ where the form to which it is assigned is stored
except the last in the chain also contains the address of the _RARE_ that is the next element of the chain ; ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain
when the address Af is computed from Af , the cell Af and all _RARE_ in its chain must be _RARE_ to determine whether Af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain
information cell for Af has been determined , it is saved as a representation of Af
continues with the next occurrence
is _RARE_ when a _RARE_ number of forms have been stored in the text-form list
the second step of _RARE_ lookup -- _RARE_ the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms
represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list
a dictionary form matches a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved
of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved
pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage
text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read
action for handling these forms can be taken at that time
form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading
address Af that lies within the _RARE_ of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the _RARE_ dictionary form
Af is an information cell , it and any information cells in the _RARE_ that have been linked to Af each contain an address in the _RARE_ where a _RARE_ matching form is stored
form is compared with each of these text forms
match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage
Af is not an information cell we conclude that the _RARE_ dictionary form is not in the text list
steps essentially complete the lookup operation
step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that _RARE_ to each form matched in the text-form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text
of text forms in the _RARE_ of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and _RARE_ are no longer required
assignment of the information cells is important
stage of translation after _RARE_ lookup is structural analysis of the input text
description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis
of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence
descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file
is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe
are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to _RARE_ and which entries to store in the computer
process takes place as the file is read
that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj
of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form
address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage
the complete file has been read , the grammatical descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the _RARE_ ; ; the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents
the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of _RARE_ _RARE_ addresses and _RARE_ the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence
requirements on dictionary information made by the _RARE_ operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms
the ordering of entries variable
an entry is a form plus the information that _RARE_ to it
very useful ways for _RARE_ a _RARE_ are the addition to the dictionary of complete _RARE_ rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form
is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage
is useful for _RARE_ information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents
techniques developed at _RARE_ for generating a _RARE_ from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once
of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form
be assigned to the _RARE_ either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context
one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form
forms of a _RARE_ are _RARE_ together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible
, the _RARE_ forms of a word can be represented , _RARE_ as regular _RARE_ allows , by a stem and a set of _RARE_ to be attached
, the set of _RARE_ can be replaced by the name of a set of _RARE_
full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list
if the _RARE_ for the forms of a word do not vary , the _RARE_ need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form
system is in no way dependent upon such _RARE_ or designed around it
and variation prevent _RARE_ , information is written in complete detail
summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased
, patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here
is toward putting dominant stress at the end
a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
first lines of one of Charles _RARE_ _RARE_ are as follows
charge to keep I have , A God to _RARE_ ''
tune to which this _RARE_ is most often _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' , the syllables have and _RARE_ , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have
is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to _RARE_ would normally center on its first _RARE_ rather than its last
parallel is significant
answer to what's wrong now
broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair
point of view of _RARE_ analysis the head word in the statement is the _RARE_ has broken , and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking ; ; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional _RARE_ of the sentence
know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; ; in one thing I know it will usually be on the _RARE_ know
people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; ; in the double sentence the smaller the town , the _RARE_ the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people
a linguist
will generally be on the subject a linguist ; ; in who's a linguist
generally be on the complement a linguist
is on her luggage both in that's her luggage , where her luggage is the complement , and in there's her luggage , where it is the subject
_RARE_ , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences
answer to what was that noise
put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out
may or may not have dominant stress
answer to what was that noise
_RARE_ the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the _RARE_ emotionally
_RARE_ are divided as in what are you looking for
likely to lose dominant stress
of extreme importance
new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not
a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here , but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snows
_RARE_ and substitute one are normally _RARE_ because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context
go with George dominant stress is probably on George ; ; but if George has just been mentioned _RARE_ ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably I'll go with him , and dominant stress is probably on the _RARE_ with
gesture _RARE_ who's he
_RARE_ has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously
George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling George is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George
what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress or no stress at all
_RARE_ it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows : nothing can snow snow but `` it ''
aren't many young people in the neighborhood the _RARE_ young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious
replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress
have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has _RARE_ stress than do
is substituted for things ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress
know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to _RARE_ pale thing
knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty
on pretty would be almost _RARE_ here
written language then can be _RARE_ or _RARE_ to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written language simply depends on the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ reader will have to back up and _RARE_
dominant stress simply indicates a _RARE_ of attention or emotion
it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also
has it in for George dominant stress will ordinarily be on in , where the notion of _RARE_ _RARE_ seems to center
painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting
is comparison or contrast , dominant stresses normally operate to center attention
his friends are stranger than his _RARE_ strong stresses are normal for his and _RARE_ , but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters
_RARE_ himself more than he's _RARE_ you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast
she _RARE_ or Japanese
to contrast the first parts of words which are _RARE_ in their last components produces an exceptional _RARE_ of the normal patterns of stress of _RARE_ and Japanese
stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship
Mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip , strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary's concerned with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have made speeches , for example ) , and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts
_RARE_ man too the situation is very similar
on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on _RARE_ treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who _RARE_ to the stimulation of hunger
, in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using _RARE_ or _RARE_ , but much of the time there is simply _RARE_ on his understanding in the light of context
word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part , it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction
yes , I have is the response to have you finished reading the paper
on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong
the leader at camp , but Jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader and therefore has stress
leader at camp , but Jack's here , with this is deprived of stress , makes here the complement in the clause
all the suggestions that were made , his was the _RARE_ the _RARE_ his represents his suggestion and is stressed
represents itself and a complement ( being equivalent , say , to go to _RARE_ ) in which boat did Jack go on
strong stress ; ; when it represents only itself and on which is its complement ( so that go on is _RARE_ equivalent to board ) , on has stronger stress than go does
a _RARE_ _RARE_ , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a _RARE_ _RARE_ for which the _RARE_ _RARE_ would be object
has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to
to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that I came to , and similarly in that was the moment I came to , there is much stronger stress on to
wanted to tell him , but I was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him
tell him , of course , to is normally _RARE_
have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions that I am to leave this place , dominant stress is ordinarily on leave
same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave , dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions
clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction _RARE_ in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written
follow
come by Tuesday
be happy long without drinking water ''
first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an _RARE_ of time equivalent to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language ; ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a _RARE_ unit used as an _RARE_ , by will be _RARE_ or lightly stressed at most
second sentence if drinking water is a _RARE_ clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; ; but if drinking is a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water
use of stress in comparison and contrast , for example , can _RARE_ _RARE_ such as these
of stress are not always _RARE_ by any means
_RARE_ have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is _RARE_ a second complement in the first sentence and a _RARE_ followed by its object in the second

are linguistic units _RARE_ in _RARE_ which are usually _RARE_ but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding _RARE_ following _RARE_ or combinations of _RARE_
genuine units , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties
the number of syllables is not clear
this point is strongest before _RARE_ and _RARE_ or _RARE_
point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables
is the _RARE_ that is employed also in _RARE_ , and al is the common _RARE_
is added , real clearly has two syllables
is every reason to regard deal as a _RARE_ , and because of the fact that _RARE_ commonly has the quality of _RARE_ when it follows vowel sounds , deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory _RARE_ with deal
obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in _RARE_ with tone systems than with _RARE_ or _RARE_
explanation is adequate to account for this
however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed
is a _RARE_ sample of successful tonal analyses
students in _RARE_ are made familiar with an _RARE_ variety of _RARE_ systems , both in their general _RARE_ and in many specific details
student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types
, even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the _RARE_ distinction between register and _RARE_ languages
familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely _RARE_ work with tone
will continue to be difficult and _RARE_ until a more representative selection of systems is _RARE_ to every _RARE_ field linguist
these four , if widely read , will contribute _RARE_ to improvement of our analytic work
need is better field techniques
majority of _RARE_ linguists fall into one or more of a number of _RARE_ types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be _RARE_ , those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to _RARE_ with tone analysis , those who take a _RARE_ view of the whole matter
has been neglect , _RARE_ efforts , or _RARE_ treatment
_RARE_ _RARE_ , so must the cure
as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple
give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures
techniques will not only _RARE_ linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes
none of these papers says much directly about field techniques
is worth _RARE_ that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in _RARE_
have been _RARE_ by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results
need is for better theory
expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but it has not been
only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are _RARE_ general
as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems
that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems
systems _RARE_ comprise _RARE_ units than either _RARE_ or vowel systems , we might expect that they would be the _RARE_ part of a phonologic analysis
does not often work out this way
are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often _RARE_ more difficult than much larger consonantal systems
suggested one explanation
use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in _RARE_ use
both _RARE_ the attention of the _RARE_ and cause confusion for the more _RARE_
is to _RARE_ the linguistic features of pitch from the _RARE_ _RARE_ features
, something of the same sort occurs with other _RARE_ of the _RARE_ : consonantal _RARE_ have both a linguistic and an individual component
general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude
, individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are _RARE_ on them
from one speaker to another , or from one emotional state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones
any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is _RARE_ recorded
explanation is suggested by the material described in _RARE_ paper
intonation often become seriously _RARE_
be adequately _RARE_ until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other
of phonologic subsystems also _RARE_ or _RARE_ in this way ; ; for example , duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation
features , for example _RARE_ catch or _RARE_ , are sometimes to be assigned to _RARE_ _RARE_ and sometimes to _RARE_ systems
other two phonologic systems are as difficult to _RARE_ as are tone and intonation in some languages
of tone difficulties , however , does not apply in all languages
( the _RARE_ type mentioned above ) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation _RARE_
of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation
even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect
explanation is suggested by _RARE_ analysis of _RARE_ tone
see a basically simple phonemic system _RARE_ in a very complex and _RARE_ morphophonemic system
_RARE_ can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to _RARE_ units , i.e. until the morphophonemics is worked out , or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success
`` typical tone language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of _RARE_ as consonantal morphophonemics
systems which must support these morphophonemic systems , however , are very different
of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level
are not merely larger , they are _RARE_
may be thought of as _RARE_ certain points in the system
in the consonantal system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used
by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of _RARE_ similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system
, in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone
are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater
therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as well , having the opposite effect
is much more _RARE_ to the beginning _RARE_ than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater
of analysis of any _RARE_ in the _RARE_ is an _RARE_ function of the size -- smaller systems are more _RARE_ -- for any given degree of morphophonemic _RARE_
will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more _RARE_ than consonantal systems
of the system is a different matter
can of course be stated much more _RARE_
system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics
more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic system will be _RARE_ without close attention to the morphophonemics -- at least , the less _RARE_ will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to _RARE_ meaningful structures
of _RARE_ has received much less attention from linguists than the problem _RARE_
been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic _RARE_ will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of _RARE_ acceptance
naive
have been content to give only the most general attention to the _RARE_ and most obvious features of the _RARE_ when _RARE_ _RARE_
feeling is that anything more would be _RARE_ in technical _RARE_ of possible _RARE_ interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs
of this attitude has been the _RARE_ of many orthography conferences by such considerations as _RARE_ ' _RARE_ ' , which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain _RARE_ carried over from European languages
the suggested systems seem to have only the most _RARE_ relationship to the language structures that they _RARE_ to represent
not always been more _RARE_ than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on _RARE_ trivial points while _RARE_ things of much greater significance
result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion
_RARE_ , in _RARE_ And _RARE_ In _RARE_ , _RARE_ one set of related _RARE_ questions and its phonologic background in detail
is merely to determine `` what _RARE_ of length and _RARE_ it may be desirable to make explicit in a _RARE_ orthography '' ( _RARE_ )
so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the _RARE_ thoroughly and in detail
process , he _RARE_ some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult
of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory
recommendations are no _RARE_ acceptance of _RARE_ on the one hand or of _RARE_ on the other
_RARE_ each phonologic fact in the light of its _RARE_ usefulness
that some changes can be made in the current orthography which will _RARE_ improve its usefulness , but _RARE_ to suggest precise _RARE_ devices to effect these changes
his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in _RARE_ circles
however , will not _RARE_ their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design
many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis
paper deals with a phonologic problem : _RARE_ Harmony In _RARE_ , by J. _RARE_
the already widely known facts in terms of _RARE_
_RARE_ it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of _RARE_
would seem more intended as a tract _RARE_ the _RARE_ theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of _RARE_ _RARE_
has a certain value as a _RARE_ easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and _RARE_ phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement
show one feature of the system that has not been previously described
does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods
to me that it rather easily can
the papers deal with grammatical problems
whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter
must be _RARE_ than the papers deserve
_RARE_ _RARE_ on The _RARE_ _RARE_ In _RARE_
be considered primarily an _RARE_ and supplement to his early A _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ In _RARE_
much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms
seems _RARE_ _RARE_ and complex , largely because the method is _RARE_ and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent _RARE_
more stems per item in Athabascan , which _RARE_ the fact that the Athabascan languages have _RARE_ somewhat more change in _RARE_ from _RARE_ than the Yokuts languages from _RARE_
be because the Athabascan _RARE_ began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both
, however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows _RARE_ stems per meaning _RARE_ as against _RARE_ for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21
deduction of _RARE_ from _RARE_ , the stem / item rate becomes _RARE_ against _RARE_ in equivalent number of languages
general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to _RARE_ comparison
difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used
in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts _RARE_ were built up of terms selected mainly to insure _RARE_ of English meaning between _RARE_ _RARE_ and myself , within a _RARE_ and uniform _RARE_ area , but that _RARE_ vocabulary is based on _RARE_ second _RARE_ list which aims at _RARE_ all items which might be _RARE_ or _RARE_ determined
short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically _RARE_ to the San _RARE_ Valley
is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4
and therefore _RARE_ , felt _RARE_ to _RARE_ all terms _RARE_ species or even _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , yellow pine , _RARE_ ) ; ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to _RARE_ or _RARE_ parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , _RARE_ , root )
are therefore really _RARE_ in content as well as in size
are included only by myself ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) or only by Swadesh and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ , _RARE_ )
have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a _RARE_ nearly even representation ( _RARE_ terms out of _RARE_ , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; ; _RARE_ and _RARE_ ; ; ( 2 ) _RARE_ ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios _RARE_ versus _RARE_ ; ; ( 3 ) _RARE_ ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios _RARE_ versus _RARE_ ; ; ( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios _RARE_ versus _RARE_
be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of _RARE_ as against _RARE_ or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower
may be connected with _RARE_ use of a much higher percentage of verbs : _RARE_ of his total list as against _RARE_ in mine
exception may be due to a particular _RARE_ peculiar to the Athabascan _RARE_
class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question

classes differ in their resistance or _RARE_ to stem replacement within meaning _RARE_ , it is _RARE_ that individual meanings also differ with fair _RARE_ _RARE_
and my Yokuts share _RARE_ identical meanings ( with allowance for several _RARE_ like _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ )
, I _RARE_ these _RARE_ items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems
for these five categories are not too _RARE_ , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively
, with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively Af ; ; Af ; ; and Af stems
particular limits of these _RARE_ may seem _RARE_ arbitrary , they do fairly express a corresponding _RARE_ of more variable material , and they _RARE_ also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in Athabascan
we count the frequency of the _RARE_ items in the two language families _RARE_ in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : Af
can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : Af ; ; which , divided by Af gives a mean of _RARE_ grades apart
distribution of the _RARE_ items were wholly _RARE_ in the two families , the distance would of course be 0
were wholly random and _RARE_ , it would be _RARE_ , assuming the five classes were equal in _RARE_ , which approximately they are
mean of _RARE_ being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and _RARE_ of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as _RARE_ long-term stem displacement

, David D. Thomas published _RARE_ _RARE_ In some _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 2 , No. 3 , _RARE_ 7 - 11 ) , which _RARE_ 8 _RARE_ languages with the _RARE_ language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( Af ) in place of original ( Af ) , and his revised 100 word basic _RARE_ list in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 21 : : _RARE_ - _RARE_ )
are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and _RARE_ in their persistence '' ; ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly _RARE_ in their average persistence '' ( as between _RARE_ and _RARE_ )
conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on _RARE_ and _RARE_ ) was partially positive
conclusion , on semantic word classes , agrees with mine
conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored
presents a simple equation for _RARE_ an index of persistence , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' _RARE_ ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency
persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning are : stem identical in 8 languages , _RARE_ ; ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , _RARE_ ; ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , _RARE_ ; ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , _RARE_
will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material
of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; and _RARE_ presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area
relative frequencies of _RARE_ _RARE_ ( 7 - 1 _RARE_ 4 - 4 , etc. ) , Thomas with his ' _RARE_ ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have
needs further exploration
at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that _RARE_ publication , in which , in _RARE_ ' _RARE_ _RARE_ ' , I set off by _RARE_ those forms in which N of stem B was Af of stem _RARE_ , the _RARE_ ones standing for Af ; ; or under ' Four _RARE_ ' , I set off by _RARE_ cases where the combined N of stems Af was Af

, and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of _RARE_ inquiry
meanings show relatively low _RARE_ of stems , as I am _RARE_ will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly
substituted for his 15 _RARE_ _RARE_ 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller
of the outcome in centuries _RARE_ since _RARE_ , calculations obviously carry more _RARE_ and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with _RARE_ unstable ones
evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great _RARE_ and feeling for the _RARE_ behavior of _RARE_ items
this urge to include unstable items in his basic list
the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural _RARE_ as possible
that insistence
the hope of _RARE_ a list of items of universal occurrence
is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a _RARE_
such a list cannot be constructed ; ; but the nearer it comes to _RARE_ _RARE_ , the less significant will it be _RARE_
will tend to be _RARE_ or vague , and they will fit actual languages more and more badly
operational problem of _RARE_ is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison
important quality of the meanings is that they should be as _RARE_ as possible
as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on their being _RARE_ and _RARE_
or a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , _RARE_ , _RARE_ identity , as do an eye or _RARE_ or _RARE_
out easily , naturally , and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of nature and existence ; ; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities
universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his _RARE_ of _RARE_ farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve _RARE_ back
has proclaimed greater or less _RARE_ between all Western hemisphere languages
this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by _RARE_ _RARE_ or by diffusion and _RARE_
farther out he moves , the _RARE_ will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the _RARE_ component in his _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but he has not _RARE_ them behind him , nor does he control them
announced results on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and almost all other American families and _RARE_ , and has _RARE_ their degree of _RARE_ ; ; but he has not worked out by _RARE_ one _RARE_ complete classification of even a single family other than _RARE_
his privilege
, _RARE_ , possible has values of its own -- values of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination
is also a firm aspect to _RARE_ : the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural _RARE_ groups of languages as well as their more remote and _RARE_ external _RARE_ ; ; of classification first , with _RARE_ age merely a _RARE_ ; ; of acquiring _RARE_ knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in _RARE_ in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more _RARE_ may have happened between them
_RARE_ progress , and such will have to be the _RARE_ work of _RARE_ as a growing body of scientific inquiry
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Swadesh has escaped our steady _RARE_ , and _RARE_ has _RARE_ his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should _RARE_

no apparent reason why we should feel bound by _RARE_ rules and procedure since his _RARE_ and aims have grown so vast
time to consider a _RARE_ of operational procedures for _RARE_ studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis
propose , first , an _RARE_ of attempts at a universal _RARE_ list , as _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ inadequate in proportion as it is achieved
propose , next , as the prime requirement for _RARE_ of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible
be no _RARE_ sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable
middle course might lead to devices like a _RARE_ _RARE_ dictionary from which every _RARE_ word was selected
was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies
nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former _RARE_ , and with _RARE_ Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other


Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of _RARE_ all discussion of _RARE_ western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down
great force late in December , from a line stretching from East _RARE_ to _RARE_ , the Red _RARE_ had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the _RARE_ , thirty miles from _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ region was being rapidly _RARE_ , while the Western _RARE_ had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the _RARE_
delay in opening the Second _RARE_ was now working to _RARE_ advantage
was now glad to propose the _RARE_ _RARE_ Line , which was substantially _RARE_ 1941 _RARE_ , as the boundary between Russia and Poland
proposal was made , Stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference
up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject
memory of _RARE_ _RARE_ from the Paris Peace Conference and of the _RARE_ effort to _RARE_ out _RARE_ at its birth _RARE_ up within him
would drive us into shame '' , he declared
_RARE_ and the _RARE_ would say that Stalin and _RARE_ were far less reliable _RARE_ of Russia than _RARE_ and _RARE_
long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted the _RARE_ Line and even agreed _RARE_ that there should be _RARE_ from that line of five to eight _RARE_ in favor of Poland in some regions
not mind the Line itself , which Churchill declared in the House of _RARE_ , on February _RARE_ , _RARE_ , he had always believed to be `` just and right '' , but he did not want it called by a hated name
had long since forgotten the events of _RARE_ , but it was not so easy for the Red leaders , who felt that they had suffered great _RARE_ in that period
_RARE_ _RARE_ of February 4 , 1942 , the State Department had expected to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 boundaries
made it clear that he meant to move _RARE_ western _RARE_ deep into Germany , back to the western _RARE_ River lines , taking not only East _RARE_ and all of _RARE_ but _RARE_ and the tip of _RARE_ , back to and including _RARE_
to nine million additional Germans would be _RARE_ , though most would have fled , and Poland would receive far more from Germany than the poor _RARE_ , including the great _RARE_ _RARE_ , which she lost to Russia
that he preferred to continue the war a little longer , `` although it costs us blood '' , in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense of the Germans
time Churchill was not so _RARE_ toward moving Poland _RARE_ as he had been at _RARE_ , where he and _RARE_ had both heartily approved the idea
a prolonged study of the _RARE_ line on a _RARE_ '' , at _RARE_ , Churchill `` liked the picture ''
tell the _RARE_ , he said , that they had been `` given a fine place to live in , more than three hundred miles each way ''
he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave , trying to find work in Germany , and Roosevelt _RARE_ to the Western _RARE_ River being chosen in the south , instead of the Eastern _RARE_ , both of which flow into the _RARE_
was left in _RARE_ , presumably for the peace conference
there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong Poland , both _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and one _RARE_ by large _RARE_ of Germans or _RARE_
of millions of the German _RARE_ , from the very heart of _RARE_ , to make room for the Polish _RARE_ whom they had _RARE_ and openly planned to _RARE_ was a _RARE_ operation , but there was little doubt that it was _RARE_ justified

importance to the West than _RARE_ boundaries was the character of her government
the West still believed that Eastern Europe could be kept in its orbit , in spite of the _RARE_ Soviet _RARE_
democracy had ever been _RARE_ in this region , and much of it was still ruled by _RARE_ means , it was taken for granted that at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this area and Western _RARE_ preserved within it
as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions , it was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that the _RARE_ should have them
was _RARE_ because the _RARE_ Polish Government in London , supported in the main by Britain , was still _RARE_ with the new Lublin Government formed behind the Red Army
was spent in trying to marry these _RARE_ than over any subject discussed at Yalta
was an agreement that the Lublin Government should be `` _RARE_ on a broader democratic basis with the _RARE_ of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the _RARE_ abroad '' , and _RARE_ to hold `` free and _RARE_ elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal _RARE_ and secret _RARE_ ''
democratic and _RARE_ parties '' were to have the right to campaign
as _RARE_ of the long debate on this issue
a matter of principle with Churchill , since Britain had declared war in behalf of Poland
it was a matter of life and death
this completely clear
`` great _RARE_ '' , he said : `` For the Russian people , the question of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security
, Poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia
the last thirty years our enemies , the Germans , have passed through this corridor
in _RARE_ interest that Poland should be strong and powerful , in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force
necessary that Poland should be free , independent in power
it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the Soviet state ''
words , the Soviet Union was determined to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful _RARE_ against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a _RARE_ _RARE_ against the _RARE_ or _RARE_ as an independent , _RARE_ power in between Russia and Germany
that invariably thereafter the _RARE_ used the same security argument to justify their course in Poland
was also as inevitable as anything could be
elections that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government in which _RARE_ had complete confidence , and all pressure from the West for free voting by _RARE_ elements in Poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements

In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern Europe , where the upper classes had generally _RARE_ with the _RARE_ , even to the extent of sending millions of their _RARE_ into Russia as a part of _RARE_ _RARE_
Yalta the _RARE_ expectations of East and West were _RARE_ into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all _RARE_ countries in Europe `` to create democratic institutions of their own choice ''
case `` here in their judgment conditions require '' ( _RARE_ added ) they would `` form _RARE_ governmental authorities _RARE_ representative of all democratic elements in the population and _RARE_ to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments _RARE_ to the will of the people ''
_RARE_ in the _RARE_ on _RARE_ Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the Western model
developed that the _RARE_ had a very different interpretation of democracy , which will be discussed later , and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should _RARE_ in establishing democratic conditions , as we understand them , within their _RARE_ of influence
thinks that at Yalta , Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him , that he thought the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ from East European elections would not be greatly _RARE_ by his _RARE_ , while neither Roosevelt nor Churchill _RARE_ faced `` the fact that , in Poland at least , _RARE_ free democratic elections would return governments _RARE_ to Russia '' , by any definition of international _RARE_
_RARE_ and cooperation had `` _RARE_ the differences between Russian and Western ideas of democracy '' , and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal _RARE_ than to _RARE_ the military _RARE_ over Germany and Japan
of these _RARE_ could not please both sides , for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable
to _RARE_ governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union instead of opposed to it , we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in East Europe
was described in a _RARE_ editorial in The New York Herald _RARE_ , on March 5 , 1947 , in connection with the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ peace _RARE_ to the Senate
so _RARE_ and _RARE_ were `` asking for the _RARE_ of a grim lesson in the facts of international life ''
_RARE_ exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world
were troubled about the fate of the _RARE_ States
us with comforting _RARE_ of a Western _RARE_ political economy _RARE_ supreme up to the _RARE_ line and the _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' ( _RARE_ added )
a _RARE_ description of our post-war illusion , which applied to other areas than East Europe
editorial continued that `` We expected to _RARE_ Japan and _RARE_ and to see a new China pattern itself easily on our institutions
, in short , that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple , from such a position , to deal with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the Soviet Union ''
`` the image _RARE_ in no way to the _RARE_ of the post-war world
military , our economic nor our _RARE_ power reached far enough '' to determine the fate of East Europe
editorial added _RARE_ : `` how far they may reach in Asia is yet _RARE_ , but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences ''
the best short explanation of the _RARE_ of the Cold War that has been written
_RARE_ the lesson so clearly contained in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , President _RARE_ _RARE_ the Cold War on March 12 , 1947 , in the _RARE_ Doctrine , exactly one week after the Herald _RARE_ editorial was written , and a year after the Cold War had been announced by Churchill at _RARE_ , _RARE_ , in _RARE_ presence
promptly went Communist , and Mr. _RARE_ had to fight the _RARE_ _RARE_ war for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ before we learned how far our _RARE_ did `` reach in Asia ''
war , strain , and hatred ; ; of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to _RARE_ before the United States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World War 2 , -- Communist control of East Europe and China -- a new balance of power
Cold War raged it was easy to blame it all on Yalta
in _RARE_ a series of careful _RARE_ on the Yalta Conference , _RARE_ _RARE_ could find no basis for Yalta becoming `` a symbol for _RARE_ and a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of Roosevelt and international cooperation ''
Yalta _RARE_ were finally published with great _RARE_ they had revealed no _RARE_ by anyone
of the election falls naturally in four parts
the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion
slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural _RARE_
interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent _RARE_ of a popular judgment led to some _RARE_
major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , _RARE_ and voting
skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above _RARE_
the _RARE_ _RARE_ results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing _RARE_ under even the most favorable circumstances
aspect , and probably the one open to most _RARE_ , is the results of the election
procedure prevented the ready identification of party _RARE_ , but all _RARE_ interested parties , including the government itself , were _RARE_ engaged in determining the party _RARE_ of all successful candidates the month following the elections
and _RARE_ point will be to estimate the _RARE_ significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics
figured _RARE_ in nearly every government program and official address since independence
stressed in the speeches of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ when the first Council of _RARE_ was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council
5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local _RARE_ and made the first firm promise of elections on May Day , 1957
a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the _RARE_ of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the _RARE_ of the Interior took the most _RARE_ view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic
complicated process of establishing new _RARE_ and _RARE_ the _RARE_ plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious
very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in _RARE_ politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to _RARE_ in the new government
_RARE_ of _RARE_ was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no _RARE_ of the right to _RARE_ or to organize for political purposes
was still firmly _RARE_ in 1957 , but the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ de _RARE_ ) , the most important minor party at the time , _RARE_ to the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the civil service and influence in Radio _RARE_
_RARE_ that the _RARE_ of the Interior favored an arbitrary , `` _RARE_ '' process , which were indirectly _RARE_ when the King personally _RARE_ in the planned meetings
following his intervention the _RARE_ issued a statement _RARE_ the citizens that `` the possibility of _RARE_ _RARE_ concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the _RARE_ itself '' would be supported by the King himself
crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French _RARE_ were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time
, 1958 , the _RARE_ of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the _RARE_ of election dates appeared once again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer
government was probably prepared for elections by _RARE_ , the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party _RARE_ _RARE_
1957 the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal _RARE_ of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government under _RARE_ was formed without support from progressive elements in the party
were on the whole _RARE_ for elections , while the people were still _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and suffering the _RARE_ of poor _RARE_ in 1957
internal and international _RARE_ that _RARE_ _RARE_ the elections remained a central issue
_RARE_ in the _RARE_ government of May , 1958 , which the King was _RARE_ determined to keep in office until elections could be held
eagerly sought `` _RARE_ '' of the _RARE_ Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal _RARE_ over foreign policy , labor politics and economic development
, 1958 , when ' _RARE_ _RARE_ became President of the Council , elections had even greater importance
increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural _RARE_ as the focus of a new , _RARE_ national effort
the chances of _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ government was formed
personnel and a special office was created in the _RARE_ of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections
time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete
only the delicate task of _RARE_ the laws through the _RARE_ of _RARE_ politics and making a small number of policy decisions
rather _RARE_ history of electoral planning in _RARE_ an important point _RARE_ concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results
new country the electoral process is considered as a means of _RARE_ fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance
absence of a _RARE_ of political _RARE_ each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new _RARE_ , but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent
respected and effective institutions that _RARE_ helps provide , minority parties , such as the _RARE_ in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal _RARE_ in 1958 , _RARE_ for elections when out of power , but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power
power tend to _RARE_ and even to _RARE_ the electoral process
to treat elections as an instrument of _RARE_ rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in _RARE_
central level the _RARE_ _RARE_ voting system was selected over some form of the _RARE_ de _RARE_ system , even though the latter had been recommended by _RARE_ and favored by all political parties
of the single member district was _RARE_ to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections
elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly _RARE_ their candidates
member districts the still _RARE_ local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly
and the _RARE_ of the Interior were _RARE_ at work after the elections trying to _RARE_ the political _RARE_ of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a _RARE_ but known degree of national political significance
national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to _RARE_ party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation
setting of the _RARE_ election may also encourage the _RARE_ of local party organization
of effective power in _RARE_ leads not only to party _RARE_ , but to _RARE_ from local activity that might have had many _RARE_ _RARE_ in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections
can be found in the results of the _RARE_ of Commerce elections , which took place three weeks before national elections
_RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ et _RARE_ ) was opposed by candidates of the new _RARE_ ( _RARE_ National _RARE_ Forces _RARE_ ) in nearly all urban centers
more conservative group with strong backing from _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ was generally favored against the more progressive , _RARE_ _RARE_
party _RARE_ heavily , while the older , more _RARE_ party expected the _RARE_ _RARE_ and small _RARE_ to support them as they had done for many years
Istiqlal and _RARE_ offices did not campaign and lost heavily
of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table 1
of Commerce elections were , of course , an important event in the preparation for rural _RARE_ elections
learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on _RARE_ support , was most effective
found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily _RARE_ to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics
effect was probably to _RARE_ more party activity in the _RARE_ elections than might have otherwise taken place
major point of this _RARE_ is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections
somewhat technical subject , it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated
the problems and solutions _RARE_ in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results
_RARE_ _RARE_ of the elections was naturally an _RARE_ and _RARE_ procedure
background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed _RARE_ that a government _RARE_ by either party could fairly _RARE_ elections
and later the _RARE_ _RARE_ protected the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ position '' until the fall of _RARE_ , and then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ government
of the preparation had , of course , proceeded under the supervision of the _RARE_ of the Interior , whose officials are _RARE_ from party activity and probably generally _RARE_ in party politics
some areas of _RARE_ trouble , like _RARE_ _RARE_ , where _RARE_ officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials _RARE_ in the electoral process
however , the administrative problem was more complex and the _RARE_ _RARE_ of office was very likely an unfair advantage
decided to remove _RARE_ a week before elections and to _RARE_ a _RARE_ Council of Government under his personal direction
_RARE_ had frequently _RARE_ that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an _RARE_ admission that party _RARE_ were a factor
Council was itself _RARE_ of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any _RARE_ members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders
details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal _RARE_ with the _RARE_
began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual _RARE_ and planning for the rural _RARE_ was completed in 1958
three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of _RARE_ and the registration of candidates
began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960
was most anxious that there be a respectable response
of the _RARE_ in each _RARE_ made the registration process into a kind of competition among _RARE_ officials
was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused on its _RARE_
to vote were kept very simple
and women of _RARE_ years of age could register and vote upon _RARE_ proof of residence and identification
liberal provisions for _RARE_ where _RARE_ or records were _RARE_
were _RARE_ along with certain categories of _RARE_ citizens , _RARE_ and those punished for _RARE_ activities
figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for _RARE_ _RARE_ were made without the benefit of a reliable census
workers who have no expectation of _RARE_ employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure _RARE_ and _RARE_ in an occupation with a future
training schools provide such training , but the current need _RARE_ the facilities
The present Federal program of vocational education began in _RARE_ with the passage of the _RARE_ Act , which provided a continuing annual _RARE_ of _RARE_ million to support , on a matching basis , _RARE_ programs of vocational education in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , industrial skills and home _RARE_
some _RARE_ supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program
Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to _RARE_ million in addition to the _RARE_ million under the Smith Act
_RARE_ Act of 1956 added _RARE_ million for practical nurse training
major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the _RARE_ Act
of _RARE_ million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled _RARE_
program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools
, administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts
states remain primarily in an _RARE_ role , providing leadership and teacher training
is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at least half
may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it
history of the program , state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or _RARE_ the Federal expenditures , while local districts all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments
Federal funds account for only _RARE_ of the _RARE_ expenditures for vocational education
impact of the _RARE_ principle has been in initially encouraging the _RARE_ states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds
considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades
War 2 , about _RARE_ million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) _RARE_ Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War _RARE_ Training
cost of the _RARE_ program was _RARE_ million
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , and National Defense Act of 1958 , the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about _RARE_ million
measures are available of _RARE_ and expenditures for private vocational education training
a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade schools and technical schools
, many large corporations operate their own formal training programs
study indicated that 85 per cent of the _RARE_ largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and _RARE_
industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions
_RARE_ Council of Columbia University has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five _RARE_ have not been formally trained
little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education
to hire youth with such training rather than those without , and most _RARE_ of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training
do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers , but it provides the essential _RARE_ for developing skills
states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools , usually located in the larger cities
_RARE_ than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses
about 13 per cent of the schools have programs , and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent
recent trend is the development of area vocational schools
number of years Kentucky , _RARE_ and several other states have been building _RARE_ vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties
are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts
be provided from nearby school districts
provided mainly for post high school day programs ; ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted
8 , program of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools
there were such schools in all but 4 states
operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas
of this program into the other _RARE_ areas should be undertaken
new industry Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to _RARE_ new industry
training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of _RARE_ training for a large number of _RARE_ machine operators
key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere
industry also may be interested in the _RARE_ advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees
of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled
can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being
besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary _RARE_ to industry which make it an _RARE_ to industrial development efforts
make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of _RARE_ new industry
exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad _RARE_ flexible basis to _RARE_ any local _RARE_ training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant
of programs The major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands
is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country
vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers
_RARE_ for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of _RARE_ the growth of local jobs , and of _RARE_ with local _RARE_ on the types of courses and their content
there is a _RARE_ _RARE_ on the part of those making local skill surveys
can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical
U. S. Department of Labor has a program of _RARE_ industry and _RARE_ employment _RARE_ and _RARE_ current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used _RARE_ in local curriculum planning
S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys
is extremely _RARE_ in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment
have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job _RARE_ and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills
is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand _RARE_ in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained
the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and _RARE_
is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable
the available information comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states
and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to _RARE_ a wider outlook on future job opportunities
a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs
question is whether _RARE_ workers can be _RARE_ to take the training provided
little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to _RARE_ in their programs , even though they must pay _RARE_ , receive no _RARE_ payments , and are not _RARE_ a job
there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training
one major difficulty is the local focus
program in a _RARE_ area may have few _RARE_ unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community
is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond
is who will pay for the training
districts are hard pressed _RARE_ and _RARE_ about vocational training
are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it
development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and _RARE_ it
have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities
Federal government is likely to be able to take a _RARE_ and _RARE_ view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs
state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit _RARE_ in other states
if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic _RARE_
would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other _RARE_
possibility is suggested by the example of the G. _RARE_ bills and also by some recent _RARE_ in attitudes toward _RARE_ college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate
would require some support for _RARE_ as well as for _RARE_ , but the total would be no greater than for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ compensation or a _RARE_ _RARE_ Corps
of $600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home
of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor
being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training
training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located
_RARE_ possibilities for _RARE_ cooperative , _RARE_ and extension training
assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual
and _RARE_ could be given more weight in selecting the proper training
, the _RARE_ _RARE_ must be examined for its _RARE_
fact that the lower _RARE_ line was _RARE_ had further forecasting significance
the application of the count rules to the width ( _RARE_ ) of the _RARE_ gives us an _RARE_ estimate of the probable depth of the decline
idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of _RARE_ activity and the extent of the _RARE_ ( run up or run down ) movement
is what really `` sold '' point and figure
is no positive and consistently _RARE_ relationship in the _RARE_ sense
show that only the _RARE_ _RARE_ apply , and in fine , these merely _RARE_ upon a relationship between the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of events
, too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long
and _RARE_ of these two types of _RARE_ , bar _RARE_ and point and figure _RARE_ , remain the subject of fairly _RARE_ _RARE_ among their respective professional _RARE_ , with both methods enjoying in common , one _RARE_ merit
both _RARE_ methods
we strip their respective claims to the _RARE_ minimum , the `` odds '' still favor them both , for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse
, many more things are _RARE_ besides prices
have been methods of _RARE_ prices , but now let us look at some of the other indices that are _RARE_ _RARE_ , and which are looked to for their forecasting _RARE_
for methods The search for forecasting _RARE_ is _RARE_
been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price
behind this is , of course , _RARE_ in character
number of reported freight car _RARE_ increased , this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity , and consequently increased stock earnings , _RARE_ _RARE_ dividends , and _RARE_ therefore increased stock market prices
know that things rarely ever work out in such _RARE_ fashion , and that car _RARE_ , while perhaps interesting enough , are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn
quest for such an index goes on _RARE_ , with all manner of _RARE_ and _RARE_ participating , ranging from the _RARE_ _RARE_ type virtually to the _RARE_ _RARE_ operator , all seeking _RARE_ , _RARE_ , daily -- and often _RARE_ -- for the enchanting index that will _RARE_ the eternal secret : Which way will the market move -- up or down
to mind the quest of _RARE_ times for the fountain of youth , a quest heavily invested in , during the days of wooden ships
heavily invested are the _RARE_ of _RARE_ of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting index
offers _RARE_
this goes on in offices high up in _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
men who make moving _RARE_ of weekly volume , monthly _RARE_ of _RARE_ ratios , ratios of the number of advances to the number of _RARE_ , ratios of an individual _RARE_ performance to overall market performance , ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume , odd-lot indices , and what not
concerned with all things _RARE_ in , _RARE_ , bonds , _RARE_ , coffee , _RARE_ , cotton , tin , _RARE_ , etc.
_RARE_ West Jackson Boulevard , La _RARE_ Street , and around the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ there sit men who chart _RARE_ reports , who divide the number of reported _RARE_ by the number of reported _RARE_ , and the number of _RARE_ by the amount of corn
the open interest curves , _RARE_ curves , and they even divide _RARE_ _RARE_ by Republican _RARE_
things and _RARE_ more enter into their calculations , and yet , the enchanting index remains _RARE_
at any rate , in the _RARE_ sense of the word
are far too subtle , and the last word in these _RARE_ will doubtless never be written , for the enchanting index is about as _RARE_ as the fountain of youth
_RARE_ men no longer pursue the fountain , they never _RARE_ their pursuit of the enchanting index
odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago
stock market , the normal trading package is a hundred shares , just as _RARE_ _RARE_ is the standard grain contract package
_RARE_ for less than a hundred shares is _RARE_ via a special odd-lot _RARE_ on the floor of the exchange
in a separate record being made , _RARE_ these _RARE_ from the overall volume of trading
the theory underlying odd-lot indices , the _RARE_ who _RARE_ odd lots is most likely a small _RARE_ , one who can't afford to trade round lots
to use the _RARE_ _RARE_ of one odd-lot index _RARE_ , they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated _RARE_ of traders
easily _RARE_ to an _RARE_ market movement , for this rank of traders can least afford to lose , virtually anything the odd-lot traders do , _RARE_ , is taken to _RARE_ the `` wrong '' thing to do
the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers
observers then make _RARE_ of the data according to their particular statistical _RARE_
, for example , plot it exactly as is , or they might make ten day moving _RARE_ of it , or longer moving _RARE_ , or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales
_RARE_ is a matter of individual taste
is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart , usually of a popular stock average
end of an intermediate or major rise , while the top is forming on the price chart , it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply
the _RARE_ that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top
at the opposite end of the market cycle , towards the end of an intermediate or major decline , usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart , it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again _RARE_ the _RARE_ that a bottom is becoming a greater _RARE_
in the aggregate , the odd-lot _RARE_ is one who _RARE_ at the _RARE_ and _RARE_ at the bottoms , _RARE_ occasional individual exceptions
had long been known in general , that `` the public is always wrong '' , the use of odd-lot indices now puts the _RARE_ on a statistical basis
well wonder why the `` public is always wrong '' and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg
first
really that the `` public '' _RARE_ at the _RARE_ , and not that the market _RARE_ out when the `` public '' _RARE_
_RARE_ at bottoms
`` public '' usually sell at bottoms , or does the market usually bottom out when the `` public '' _RARE_
been using the word `` public '' in _RARE_ marks , that is , in its _RARE_ _RARE_ with reference to the odd-lot index theory
has to sell in order for someone to buy , and vice _RARE_
all concerned are members of the literal public , somewhat less than all concerned , although still a majority , form the _RARE_ marked `` public ''
public _RARE_ the `` public '' leaves the so-called `` sophisticated '' element -- the element on the other end of the `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_
is often called `` strong hands ''
differ from `` weak hands '' in that their operations are the primary _RARE_
_RARE_ , so to speak , even if this _RARE_ is _RARE_ among them , and their _RARE_ action only _RARE_ organized
act ; ; weak hands react
move first ; ; weak hands ask , What is going on
hands buy , they are able to buy more , and they do it even in the face of _RARE_ news reports
able to sit more _RARE_ with what they have bought
say , strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands , for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands _RARE_ on the way up , at higher prices , during the _RARE_ phase of the campaign
_RARE_ market critics are often _RARE_ to feel that there is something somehow unfair , dirty , or even thoroughly criminal about this _RARE_ of competitive forces
all , can anyone imagine a market _RARE_ the reverse of these things were true
imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose , and the majority would make consistent profits
and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few
the _RARE_ concerning the `` sophisticated '' _RARE_ and its _RARE_ _RARE_ is put to test during every campaign , and _RARE_ only upon results ; ; not before
often happens that _RARE_ go _RARE_ , resulting in a most _RARE_ _RARE_ of strong hands into _RARE_ hands , just as a member of a former _RARE_ `` public '' may emerge _RARE_ `` right '' the next time
the _RARE_ _RARE_ too
of odd-lot indices is somehow _RARE_ to the _RARE_ of a man trying to _RARE_ his own shadow , what with all observers trying to get on the side of the `` few '' at the same time
of this study and of _RARE_ analysis as well , _RARE_ in direct proportion to the _RARE_ of its use
to , by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word `` few ''
must _RARE_ as to the future course of prices , if there is to _RARE_ a market at all
few must win what the many lose , for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all , and is , in fact , _RARE_
be no _RARE_ about _RARE_ this
_RARE_ that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market _RARE_ the majority consistently _RARE_ what the minority _RARE_
_RARE_ , whose work has been discussed in this chapter , was quoted in a New _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ as saying : `` Of course , you have to remember it's a good thing for us _RARE_ that there aren't more of us
got too many people _RARE_ by this method , their operations would begin to affect stock prices , and thus throw the _RARE_ off
would become _RARE_ ''
H. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ In Point And Figure _RARE_ tells the _RARE_ : `` We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the _RARE_ and commodities markets ''
traders trading for so many different objectives , and what with there being so many unique and _RARE_ market theories and trading techniques in use , and more coming into use all the time , it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` fans '' to _RARE_ itself
all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible _RARE_ of expression , if they lead to a market _RARE_ at all
final analysis , then , the _RARE_ becomes either a _RARE_ or a bear in a given instance , _RARE_ any amount of _RARE_ and calculation , however elaborate
his theory or technique may not be _RARE_ , it is _RARE_ for _RARE_ and _RARE_ positions to become temporarily _RARE_
methods of deciding may be profound and _RARE_ , the possible conclusions remain but two
, more methods the _RARE_ The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to _RARE_ the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use , so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather _RARE_ empirical correlation that is to follow , and to _RARE_ the _RARE_ that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead
the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity
large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates
the trend of general business activity in 1961 will _RARE_ a _RARE_ influence on fiscal , _RARE_ , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates
been a _RARE_ year for _RARE_ of general business activity
of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a _RARE_ _RARE_ , but there have been persistent signs of _RARE_ in the economy
for general business activity to _RARE_ somewhat is becoming more evident
pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the _RARE_ process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer
difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust
of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be _RARE_ out and facing some decline
business _RARE_ , when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp _RARE_ in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain
time , however , there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to _RARE_ a sharp rise in residential construction
are the inventories of _RARE_ houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in _RARE_ rates for apartments ( _RARE_ in September )
other hand , in a more favorable vein , general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising Federal spending , and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course
increase in retail sales in October to a _RARE_ high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference Board , which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans
of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate _RARE_ through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way
will probably be _RARE_ by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit , as well as by an expansion of Government spending , well sustained consumer spending , and some _RARE_ of business inventories
pressure What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961
that during the next several months , through the spring of 1961 , the demand for long-term capital funds may be _RARE_ lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower , especially the rates on Federal , state , and local bonds , as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds
as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present , as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by _RARE_ , the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high , so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great
likely , moreover , that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage _RARE_ institutions , interest rates on residential _RARE_ may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year , although the increased ease in residential mortgage _RARE_ may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate , e.g. , easier _RARE_ and _RARE_ terms
trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here , we are likely to see additional steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit
further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility , as well as an easier reserve position for the _RARE_ system
the _RARE_ authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the _RARE_ of gold , as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive _RARE_ in the economy , which would delay the effectiveness of _RARE_ policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle
policy One of the most _RARE_ questions is whether the recent _RARE_ of the Federal Reserve authorities from _RARE_ their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread into _RARE_ Government _RARE_ in the next few months
extent that the new Administration has its wishes , the Federal Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of Government _RARE_ and _RARE_ seek to force down long-term interest rates
of `` bills only '' , or `` bills preferably '' , seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to _RARE_ conditions which would persuade the authorities to _RARE_ _RARE_ from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term Government _RARE_
to the extent that the _RARE_ authorities , in their effort to ease credit in the next several months , conduct their open market operations in _RARE_ Government bonds , they will certainly act to _RARE_ any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces
end of the spring of 1961 , assuming that a general business recovery gets under way , interest rates should begin to edge upward again , depending upon the _RARE_ of the recovery and the determination with which the _RARE_ authorities move to _RARE_ credit availability
would be that interest rates will decline _RARE_ into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the _RARE_
pertinent to ask the question : _RARE_ the long _RARE_ of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course , and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates
is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels
forces This view is based upon several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in the Sixties , as follows : ( 1 ) Recent events in the General _RARE_ of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us , and probably _RARE_ , for the _RARE_ future
it certain that Federal expenditures for military _RARE_ and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years
just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new African nations against the _RARE_ competition of the Communist _RARE_
to overcome the lead of the _RARE_ in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending
it is likely that Federal policies aimed at _RARE_ a faster rate of economic growth of the country , to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs , will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education , housing , medical aid , and the like
serious _RARE_ involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures , of which I take a dim view , but it seems very likely to occur
) During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant _RARE_ up in the rate of household _RARE_ , which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building
the latest projections of the Bureau of the _RARE_ , the annual rate of household _RARE_ will increase for the next 20 years
most favorable assumptions for increase , the Bureau of the _RARE_ projects that the annual rate of household _RARE_ will rise from about _RARE_ in the last two years of the _RARE_ to an annual rate of about _RARE_ in the first five years of the Sixties , and to a slightly higher annual rate of _RARE_ in the second half of the decade
_RARE_ the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of _RARE_ in the second half of that decade
the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing _RARE_ by the higher rate of household formation should _RARE_ the general economic prospects of the Sixties
the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated
annual rate of _RARE_ in the second half of the Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ period from April 1947 to March _RARE_
) With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties , a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated
an area in which there is still a large _RARE_ of demand
local expenditures ( in real terms ) increased _RARE_ from _RARE_ in 1949 to _RARE_ in 1959 , and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade , which would carry them to the neighborhood of _RARE_ by _RARE_
be a powerful force for raising business activity
) It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play , the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the _RARE_
keen competition in our industrial system , and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research , plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade
) In a more _RARE_ vein about the economic outlook , I suspect that the _RARE_ of demand for consumer goods and housing which was _RARE_ during the _RARE_ and World War 2 , is finally in the process of running dry
some _RARE_ evidence of this
, the huge _RARE_ demand on the part of _RARE_ for housing under the _RARE_ home loan _RARE_ program seems to have largely exhausted itself
the failure of _RARE_ as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing , and the increasing reports of pockets of _RARE_ homes and rising _RARE_ rates in apartment buildings , may also signal in part that the _RARE_ days of big _RARE_ demand for housing are reaching an end
way , we may be _RARE_ the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on _RARE_ cars free of the _RARE_ which were accepted in the _RARE_
_RARE_ of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the War was fed by liquid assets _RARE_ by the public during the War , and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields
public has used up a good part of these liquid assets , or they have been drained by the rising price level , and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier
not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties
_RARE_ that it will , but consumer spending in the Sixties will not be _RARE_ by the great _RARE_ of wants and desires which characterized most of the _RARE_
become more competitive as _RARE_ become more selective
requirements Accordingly , during the Sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the _RARE_ and , in the process , to require enormous amounts of capital funds
of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases
of this paper is to _RARE_ one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the _RARE_ behavior of a few very important industries
may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of _RARE_ to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2
the apparent _RARE_ of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented
of this paper _RARE_ an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its _RARE_ policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny
industry's product price has been kept below the `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands
of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications
to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public-limit _RARE_ '' on `` key '' wage _RARE_ , we deliberately simplify the model by _RARE_ from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation
purposes , this is best treated as a model which _RARE_ out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it _RARE_ to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages
, below describes this abstract model by _RARE_ out its assumptions
, _RARE_ the operation of the model and _RARE_ some significant conclusions
, _RARE_ the empirical _RARE_ and policy implications of the conclusions
, is a brief summary
Appendix presents the _RARE_ argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit
the assumptions of the model A
The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product
is _RARE_
purposes of setting the product price , the industry _RARE_ as a single _RARE_
_RARE_ , the industry _RARE_ as a unit with a single union

for the industry's product We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry's product
in which this is shared among firms is taken as given
given time period , the aggregate demand for the industry's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of Aj
purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is _RARE_ in these two variables , since GNP includes other prices
abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change _RARE_
form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary _RARE_ with the product price , and vary directly with the level of Aj

price policy The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest
its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases
of effective _RARE_ action , _RARE_ by `` _RARE_ the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of _RARE_ relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases
industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the _RARE_ _RARE_ price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the _RARE_ price ( but not below average cost )
an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is _RARE_ `` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc. )
if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate
model , we abstract from all _RARE_ sources of cost changes , so that the `` public-limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises
circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate
costs rise when the wage rate rises , the _RARE_ price also rises when the public-limit price is _RARE_ , and is likely to remain well above the latter
price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general _RARE_ permits profit _RARE_ to increase _RARE_ throughout the economy , we might expect the public-limit price to approach the _RARE_ price
price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic _RARE_ do not enter foreign costs directly
approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its _RARE_ in `` _RARE_ '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , _RARE_ _RARE_ relief after it has `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ to the union pressure
not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase
to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase
_RARE_ from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry
may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in order to `` _RARE_ '' the government and the customers of the industry
strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement
increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage _RARE_ would _RARE_
and resistance to _RARE_ increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of _RARE_ per _RARE_ than when the increases are on the order of _RARE_ per month
passage of an additional eleven _RARE_ time makes the second _RARE_ _RARE_ more _RARE_
the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase
however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per _RARE_ , without an accompanying wage increase
higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase
not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however -- only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against _RARE_ increases
since the public requires some _RARE_ on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less than _RARE_ larger price increases ( e.g. , if a wage increase of _RARE_ allows a price increase of _RARE_ , a wage increase of _RARE_ allows a price increase of something less than _RARE_ )

We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced ( the average cost curve is _RARE_ , and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry )
of this average cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and so forth
have noted , however , we are _RARE_ from changes in all _RARE_ of this level except for changes in the wage rate
of average cost ( equal to marginal cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate

and collective _RARE_ issues The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate
does not regard _RARE_ of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment
vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset _RARE_ increases , but we abstract from these forces here
present purposes we assume that the sole subject of _RARE_ is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or _RARE_ adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs
something of an _RARE_ concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public
the amount of productivity increase _RARE_ the problem of _RARE_ how an increase in profit _RARE_ related to a productivity increase should be shared
of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not _RARE_ the assumption that the union is willing to settle for _RARE_ and _RARE_ increases as distinct from a _RARE_ increase in the basic wage rate
further that the union recognizes the possibility that _RARE_ increases may offset _RARE_ increases , and it does not entirely _RARE_ the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate
political reasons , the union asks for ( and _RARE_ ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously _RARE_ a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate _RARE_ is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry
the basic wage rate are _RARE_ , and they constitute an argument for raising prices
it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude
model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be _RARE_ out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise
for _RARE_ changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active _RARE_ , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry _RARE_
in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be _RARE_ in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages _RARE_
_RARE_ it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model
this conclusion that we challenge ; ; we do so by _RARE_ the _RARE_ on which it is based
the operation of the model It is convenient to assume that the _RARE_ contract is of one year's duration
century from _RARE_ to _RARE_ the law of nations became international law
contributed to this change
of _RARE_ is a convenient starting point because it both _RARE_ and _RARE_ what was to follow
_RARE_ the great nations assembled to _RARE_ not merely for Europe , but for the world
Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century
had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations _RARE_ , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense
imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and _RARE_ in their political _RARE_ with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared
_RARE_ , international law was _RARE_
not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions
one hand , the major European nations had to maintain _RARE_ each other an emphasis upon _RARE_ , independence , formal _RARE_ -- thus _RARE_ for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of _RARE_ '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the _RARE_ _RARE_ experience
was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world
theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere
in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America ( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine , itself from the _RARE_ related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance '' itself
such as _RARE_ could be _RARE_ by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its _RARE_ ; ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the _RARE_ of the Latin American countries ; ; out of the question was the _RARE_ of Asia and Africa
of the law was made explicit by a number of _RARE_ century scholars
was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` _RARE_ nations '' ; ; Kent and _RARE_ , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made use of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent
that the public law was essentially `` limited to the _RARE_ and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin ''
it had always been of European origin in fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory
with virtually every writer , not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced _RARE_ of Europe were to be imposed on others
customs on which international law was based were to become , by force and _RARE_ , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states
for example , was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of _RARE_ countries
do something with the _RARE_ of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its _RARE_ beyond all possibility of _RARE_ ''
nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers , though _RARE_ , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today
of other _RARE_ developments contributed to the _RARE_ of the law of nations into international law ; ; that is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states
is important , for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among _RARE_ , this was by no means its exclusive _RARE_
of nature _RARE_ _RARE_ in their relationship to their own citizens , to _RARE_ , and to each other in a _RARE_ unified system
of international law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this _RARE_
sight of the individual almost entirely and _RARE_ itself to rules _RARE_ the exercise of state power for reasons essentially _RARE_ with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations
did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do ; ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action
this development , we must _RARE_ it to other aspects of _RARE_ philosophy
and most obvious , was the growing _RARE_ and the tendency to regard the state , and the _RARE_ identification with the state , as _RARE_ other _RARE_ of social solidarity
was not new , but it was _RARE_ in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new _RARE_ occurred
its ultimate philosophical statement in _RARE_ of `` state will '' put forward by the Germans , especially by _RARE_ , although political _RARE_ will recognize its _RARE_ in the rejected _RARE_ of _RARE_
was reflected _RARE_ in law theories which incorporated this _RARE_ _RARE_ and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection
international community this reduced law to _RARE_ _RARE_
, the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , or _RARE_
the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical _RARE_
longer sought to find the law ; ; he made it ; ; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be
no law , domestic or international , except that _RARE_ by , acknowledged by , or _RARE_ to by states
_RARE_ _RARE_ were more practical reasons for a changing _RARE_
, but _RARE_ from , _RARE_ was the growth of democracy in one form or another
in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions
of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of _RARE_ , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be _RARE_ and enforced as law through _RARE_ institutions
a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms
this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were _RARE_
way of doing things , which _RARE_ on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no longer adequate to the task
the period of _RARE_ of existing law : the Code _RARE_ in France and the peculiar _RARE_ that , in fact , resulted from _RARE_ _RARE_ and ordering of the Common Law in England
followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations
mills have been grinding ever since , and when its _RARE_ processes were no longer adequate to the task , a limited legislative authority was _RARE_ in one form or another , to the executive
_RARE_ century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and _RARE_ have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law
with developed _RARE_ , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific
systems we tend to view what is called _RARE_ as _RARE_ a movement to _RARE_ policy by increasing the power of _RARE_ -- the elected representatives -- at the expense of the more conservative _RARE_
power of the latter was made both limited and explicit -- when norms were _RARE_ and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in _RARE_ hands -- two purposes were served : Government was made _RARE_ to an _RARE_ popular will , and law became a rational system for _RARE_ that will , for serving conscious goals , for _RARE_ the `` public policy ''
true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , _RARE_ the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; ; but even _RARE_ was a conscious policy
seen as an _RARE_ of the `` sovereign will ''
the sovereign was not _RARE_ absolute _RARE_ but rather the _RARE_ sovereign of _RARE_
, too , an _RARE_ philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by no means an _RARE_ or _RARE_ one
through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his _RARE_
did not require , though it _RARE_ might acquire , a _RARE_ _RARE_
merely a _RARE_ and ordering of new institutions of popular government
not opposed to either justice or morality ; ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who _RARE_ public authority
this true as _RARE_ _RARE_ became the dominant credo of Western society
the factors of production was a major objective of the rising _RARE_ , and this objective required that governmental authority -- administrative officials and judges -- be limited as precisely and _RARE_ as possible ; ; that old customs which _RARE_ trade be _RARE_ ; ; that business be free from governmental supervision and _RARE_ of morality which might _RARE_ the automatic adjustments of the free market ; ; that obligations of status that were _RARE_ with the new politics and the new _RARE_ be done away with
conceived as the free _RARE_ of formal _RARE_ -- replaced the implied obligations of a more static and _RARE_ society
contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the _RARE_ of the free society
was based upon contract ; ; business organization -- the corporation -- was analyzed in contractual terms ; ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was _RARE_ and _RARE_ on contractual terms ; ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement
not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract
, some -- _RARE_ is the principle example -- went so far as to say that all international law could be _RARE_ to the single legal _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
( at least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical _RARE_ of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ centuries by _RARE_ _RARE_ both international law theory and doctrine
first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , _RARE_ the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system
was to _RARE_ much that had been regarded as the law of nations
, the law _RARE_ , and the host of problems which arise in private _RARE_ because of some contact with a foreign country were all _RARE_ from the older Law of Nations and made dependent on the several national laws
law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international law proper , or , as it is often called , public international law
free to _RARE_ , within broad , though ( perhaps ) _RARE_ limits , their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law _RARE_ , and to _RARE_ legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high _RARE_
was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be _RARE_ by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations
Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power
view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the _RARE_ of Article 1
seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a _RARE_ jurisdiction
jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law
_RARE_ , apparently in response to the _RARE_ influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- _RARE_ with state _RARE_ -- to decide cases involving _RARE_ questions
of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights _RARE_ by the Civil War _RARE_ against state interference
arose with the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
, presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly _RARE_ slaves , became a `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ upon state economic policy
of federal lower court _RARE_ seriously _RARE_ the processes of local government
with a series of measures _RARE_ in various ways what it had granted in _RARE_
it required the _RARE_ of a special _RARE_ court for the _RARE_ of certain _RARE_ and allowed direct _RARE_ to the Supreme Court
was _RARE_ and extended from time to time thereafter
an _RARE_ provision was made for the stay of federal _RARE_ proceedings upon institution of state court test cases
_RARE_ of these measures resulted in _RARE_ in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to _RARE_ state public utility rate orders
later similar restraints were imposed upon _RARE_ against collection of state taxes
for state _RARE_ , in the first instance , the two major areas where federal _RARE_ had been most _RARE_ , but other areas remained _RARE_
the Supreme Court , like Congress , showed _RARE_ concerning this aspect of government by _RARE_
the traditional discretion of the _RARE_ , Mr. Justice _RARE_ introduced a series of _RARE_ judicial restraints that _RARE_ in Mr. Justice _RARE_ famous doctrine of _RARE_
earlier cases turned rather _RARE_ upon the availability of adequate state _RARE_ , the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue
case is _RARE_ Commission v. _RARE_
had issued an administrative order which was _RARE_ as _RARE_ against Negroes
was _RARE_ by a federal trial court
the Supreme Court , via Mr. Justice Frankfurter , found southern _RARE_ problems `` a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to _RARE_ is open ''
was found in the _RARE_ of state law as to whether the _RARE_ order had in fact been authorized
as usual , to interpret state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` _RARE_ rather than a determination '' -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter led a _RARE_ Court to _RARE_ the _RARE_
is crucial that here , unlike _RARE_ , the trial court was ordered to _RARE_ the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the _RARE_ question
resources of _RARE_ are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
, i.e. , _RARE_ , is one thing ; ; refusal to _RARE_ is another
extent that the _RARE_ principle of _RARE_ stands _RARE_ by subsequent legislation , federal equitable relief against state action must be available -- or so it seems to Mr. Justice Frankfurter
Public Service Commission v. Southern _RARE_ Co. , the commission had refused to permit _RARE_ of certain `` _RARE_ '' train facilities
, claiming _RARE_ of property without due process of law , sought _RARE_ relief
held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be _RARE_ ; ; this in the name of equitable discretion
and Jackson _RARE_ in the _RARE_ result , for they found no merit in the _RARE_ claim
_RARE_ vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction _RARE_ in a valid act of Congress : `` By one fell _RARE_ the Court now finds that Congress _RARE_ in _RARE_ legislation in the acts of 1910 , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_
measures , Congress , so the Court ( in effect ) now _RARE_ , gave not only _RARE_ but inadequate relief , since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to _RARE_ the Act of _RARE_ against all proceedings _RARE_ local _RARE_ ''
revealing recent case is _RARE_ _RARE_ Union v. Lincoln Mills
Act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over `` suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry _RARE_ commerce ''
face this merely provides a federal _RARE_ ; ; it does not establish any law ( rights ) for the federal judges to _RARE_
judges exercise jurisdiction to _RARE_ national rights when Congress has created none
held that Congress had intended the federal _RARE_ to `` fashion '' an appropriate law of _RARE_ contracts
, _RARE_ power to grant _RARE_ authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not create , or specify , the right to be enforced
Mills decision _RARE_ a whole new body of federal `` common law '' which , as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in _RARE_ , leads to one of the following `` _RARE_ '' : `` ( ( 1 ) conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective _RARE_ agreements ; ; ( 2 ) displacement of state law by federal law in state courts in all actions regarding collective _RARE_ agreements ; ; or ( 3 ) _RARE_ of state court jurisdiction over these matters ''
elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that _RARE_ purpose was merely to make unions _RARE_
few exceptions , the _RARE_ seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved -- to say nothing of the _RARE_ of _RARE_ power to judges
these _RARE_ difficulties , Mr. Justice Frankfurter was prepared to read the _RARE_ provision as concerned with diversity , rather than federal question , jurisdiction
satisfy what presumably was _RARE_ major purpose -- the _RARE_ of unions
also leave intact the _RARE_ traditional authority in the realm of contract law
we have seen , the _RARE_ and York decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state _RARE_ rules
again Mr. Justice Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of _RARE_ judicial legislation
wants to _RARE_ the states from areas which they have _RARE_ occupied , let it do so _RARE_ and _RARE_
it do its own _RARE_ and not leave that to federal judges
Mills suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction over _RARE_ divorce cases , the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the _RARE_ of marriages
a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases
not clearly defined the _RARE_ between state and federal court competence
the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a _RARE_ basis
student has suggested that `` In any new _RARE_ ( of the _RARE_ Code ) the _RARE_ would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their _RARE_ in federal law might be used , leaving to the state _RARE_ the primary _RARE_ of _RARE_ state law ''
the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in Mr. Justice _RARE_ opinions -- to the extent that Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion
rule of _RARE_ and division of labor _RARE_ him in the _RARE_ _RARE_ cases , in the administrative law area , and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review
Black no doubt _RARE_ in principle but is more _RARE_ to make exceptions to achieve a generous and `` just '' result
not be `` _RARE_ by _RARE_ ''
of state decisions With few exceptions , Congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to _RARE_ rights arising under federal law
it differently , state and federal courts have _RARE_ jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right
uniformity in the meaning of national law , however , state interpretations are subject to Supreme Court review
be noted , _RARE_ , that to _RARE_ `` desegregation '' an _RARE_ and former southern governor has urged Congress to _RARE_ this _RARE_ authority
, of course , would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states
also probably mean different things within the same state -- depending upon what court ( state or federal ) rendered decision
here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial _RARE_ relationship
is that enforcement of national law in state _RARE_ _RARE_ in reverse the old diversity _RARE_ of the relation of procedure to substance
certain _RARE_ restraints in favor of fair trials , each level of government is free to _RARE_ its own judicial procedures
choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure
_RARE_ applies to those who press state claims in federal _RARE_ , e.g. , in diversity cases
_RARE_ _RARE_ the state court followed established state procedure by _RARE_ a vague _RARE_ `` most strongly against '' the _RARE_
words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the _RARE_ by state law
was that the _RARE_ case was dismissed
Black led a _RARE_ majority : `` _RARE_ local rules of pleading cannot be used to _RARE_ unnecessary _RARE_ upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law ''
as in the _RARE_ case , another element of state procedure was _RARE_ to federal _RARE_ law
and Jackson _RARE_ : `` One State may _RARE_ _RARE_ more than another , one State may be more _RARE_ than another to _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ a Federal right in a State court , he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are _RARE_ who press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated -- the _RARE_ , for instance , with which a cause of action must be described
, though _RARE_ in a State court , _RARE_ the Federal claim -- _RARE_ what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it
form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State _RARE_ in the enforcement of like obligations created by it , so long as a requirement does not add to , or _RARE_ , the right as defined by Federal law , nor burden the realization of this right in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ ''
in the area of _RARE_ relationships is this : what _RARE_ _RARE_ error in a state decision
Chicago involved a conviction for _RARE_ conduct under a local _RARE_
in question was a speech
did not object to the trial _RARE_ charge to the jury that _RARE_ `` may constitute a _RARE_ of the peace if it _RARE_ the public to anger , _RARE_ dispute , brings about a condition of _RARE_
present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so _RARE_ limited speech as to _RARE_ the federal _RARE_
accused raised many other objections , he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings
, he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right
can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to _RARE_ bond discount and _RARE_ ( section _RARE_ ) , but not the right to _RARE_ bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section _RARE_ ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section _RARE_ ) , but not allowing rapid _RARE_ of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a _RARE_ carryover to a personal holding company ( section _RARE_ ) , but not carryover of excess tax _RARE_ for foreign taxes
, and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section _RARE_
not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax _RARE_ or in terms of _RARE_ possibilities
to items such as these the provisions of section _RARE_ , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or _RARE_ to the _RARE_ corporation
extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning _RARE_ with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute
not _RARE_ that section _RARE_ should _RARE_ the survival of all of the _RARE_ tax attributes
interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly _RARE_ the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code
Section 203 of the United States Code _RARE_ an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ for its payment has been issued
were not for judicial development of certain exceptions , this section would _RARE_ a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation , even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section _RARE_
recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation
case , _RARE_ Air Line _RARE_ v. United States , held that the _RARE_ could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed
said the purpose of the section was _RARE_ to spare the Government the _RARE_ and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a stranger to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly _RARE_ claims , against the Government
, said the Court , applied to the case at hand ; ; _RARE_ , Congress could not be presumed to have intended to _RARE_ _RARE_ approved by the states
are assignments for the benefit of _RARE_ , corporate _RARE_ , transfers by _RARE_ , or transfers by _RARE_
often classified as transfers by `` operation of law ''
reorganization not _RARE_ with the merger or consolidation _RARE_ of the states involved is difficult to fit into an `` operation of law '' mold
is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash , to which section 203 quite clearly applies , the courts and Treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of _RARE_ _RARE_ may sue for refund of taxes paid by _RARE_
case in point is _RARE_ _RARE_ v. United States , in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose partners were former stockholders , and then to another corporation formed by the partners
final corporation entitled to sue on the claim , the Court _RARE_ the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments _RARE_ by the statute ''
earlier case , _RARE_ & Co. v. United States , an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and then _RARE_ the British corporation
statute was held not to prevent the American corporation from _RARE_ for a refund of taxes paid by the British corporation
presumably would have qualified under section _RARE_ as a contractual reorganization , followed by a section _RARE_ liquidation , but not under section _RARE_ as a statutory merger of consolidation
, nevertheless , relied on the _RARE_ case and also mentioned that the _RARE_ of the two corporations were the same
, said the Court , there was no transfer of equitable title
_RARE_ at substantially the same conclusion , but _RARE_ the problem of section 203 of the United States Code
_RARE_ provides that if the corporation against which a tax was _RARE_ has since been _RARE_ by merger with a successor corporation , a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax , followed by the name of the successor corporation
of the liquidation and succession must also be filed
succession is a matter of public record , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of State or other public officials having _RARE_ of the _RARE_ will _RARE_ ; ; if the succession is not of record , all _RARE_ relating to such succession , properly certified , are required
proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation , the latter to a contractual acquisition
would not , however , apply to an acquisition of assets for cash
_RARE_ , although rather _RARE_ , _RARE_ and follows _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization
a successor corporation in a C reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the _RARE_ corporation despite section 203
B reorganization , followed by a section _RARE_ liquidation , those cases which hold that section 203 is _RARE_ to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor
, a cash purchase of a _RARE_ stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the _RARE_ doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step
appear sound
in _RARE_ and numerous other cases , the two primary reasons for the _RARE_ of section 203 of the United States Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of _RARE_ claims on a _RARE_ basis
have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed
reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section _RARE_ , which is the only type presently under discussion
applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a _RARE_ owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent , a statutory merger or consolidation , an acquisition of substantially all a _RARE_ assets solely in exchange for voting stock , or a change of identity , form , or place of organization
every case the transferor corporation is _RARE_ , and its former stockholders either own _RARE_ , or have a continuing stock interest in , the assets which gave rise to the tax
circumstances the possibility of multiple or _RARE_ claims is exceedingly remote
in a C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger , to which the statute is clearly _RARE_
it at all likely that a `` desperate '' claim against the Government will be assigned on a _RARE_ basis in the _RARE_ of a tax-free reorganization
transferor has substantial assets other than the claim , it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes
an unlikely _RARE_ were to take place , it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase , followed by the _RARE_ of the claim by the _RARE_ _RARE_ , followed by liquidation
rare case where a _RARE_ only substantial _RARE_ , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock
, then , that although the matter is not dealt with in section _RARE_ , a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section _RARE_ is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation
of the United States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the Government transferred in tax-free _RARE_
corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims
attributes of the transferor There are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved
, property `` used in the trade or business '' of a transferor corporation , as defined in section _RARE_ , presumably would not _RARE_ its special status following a _RARE_ reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation
of a group filing _RARE_ returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section _RARE_ , but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not , for example , elected to file _RARE_ returns with its own _RARE_
presumably made it difficult to _RARE_ a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of _RARE_ ( section _RARE_ ) or depreciation ( section _RARE_ )
of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provide for survival of certain of a _RARE_ tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization
requires carryover of the transferor _RARE_ basis for property transferred , and section _RARE_ provides for _RARE_ on the _RARE_ holding period for such property to that of the _RARE_
permits a person acquiring _RARE_ facilities to _RARE_ to continue _RARE_ over a _RARE_ period
a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section _RARE_ for a person acquiring emergency facilities
to a loss carryover
be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating _RARE_ and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items
, suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted , providing for carryover of excess profits _RARE_
right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover
an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of _RARE_ income ; ; it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which _RARE_ to have a high excess profits tax
_RARE_ Code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the _RARE_ _RARE_ case , but only over the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ Hand , who wrote the majority opinion in the _RARE_ case , a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a _RARE_ reorganization
type of item was not in the statute when section _RARE_ was enacted in 1954 , one cannot say with certainty what effect the _RARE_ of that section should have
to this type of item , one might properly apply the language of the Committee Report , quoted above , which _RARE_ against using section _RARE_ as a basis for _RARE_ other tax attributes not mentioned therein
there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover
primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax _RARE_

selecting mail questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for _RARE_ the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited _RARE_ of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire
method of _RARE_ a small number of companies was _RARE_ because of the opportunity it might have furnished to _RARE_ fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying _RARE_ attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies
result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in _RARE_ some of the fundamental and _RARE_ problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government
also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest _RARE_ inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature
recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations
the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents
yes '' or `` no '' answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have
may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question
also the problem of the _RARE_ frame of reference
respondent making a recommendation for his own benefit , for the benefit of his industry , for the benefit of a specific government department or service , for the benefit of the defense program , for the benefit of small business , or for the benefit of the _RARE_
also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on _RARE_ information and carefully considered judgment , or whether his answers were casual _RARE_
there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held -- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the _RARE_
team was very _RARE_ of these _RARE_ and limitations of a mail questionnaire
circumstances , however , the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point
preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered , and the structure and _RARE_ used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations

the questionnaire The questionnaire was designed to _RARE_ three types of information : ( 1 ) the facts regarding certain characteristics of the respondents , including their experience with , and interest in , _RARE_ defense business ; ; ( 2 ) the actual selling and buying practices of the respondents ; ; and ( 3 ) the attitudes and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and the methods of _RARE_ defense contracts
hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer _RARE_ to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did
sections of the questionnaire ( see Appendix B ) are devoted to the following : 1
_RARE_ respondents ( Part A of the questionnaire ) 2
defense sales activities ( Part B of the questionnaire ) 3
in participating in advertised bidding for defense business ( Part C of the questionnaire ) 4
in participating in _RARE_ bidding for defense purposes ( Part D of the questionnaire ) 5
regarding advertised bidding ( Part E of the questionnaire ) 6
regarding _RARE_ bidding ( Part F of the questionnaire ) 7
regarding the methods of _RARE_ defense contracts ( Part G of the questionnaire ) The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was _RARE_
also stated that , in any event , all _RARE_ would be treated _RARE_
interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves

_RARE_ of the questionnaire The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months
, 1960 , an early draft of the questionnaire , along with a cover letter , was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of Washington
after the companies had received the questionnaire , members of the research team _RARE_ the _RARE_ of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any _RARE_ or difficulties the _RARE_ might have experienced in _RARE_ the questionnaire
resulted in further _RARE_ of the questionnaire
team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might not be typical of those throughout the country , or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made
another test of the _RARE_ was made
draft was mailed in July , 1960 , to 100 firms throughout the United States
the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from _RARE_ names submitted by member companies of the _RARE_ Industries Association ( AIA list ) and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of _RARE_ names compiled by the research team from the Thomas _RARE_ ( _RARE_ list )
of _RARE_ the AIA and _RARE_ lists will be described later
after the questionnaires were mailed , follow-up _RARE_ _RARE_ were sent _RARE_ those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once
in all were received
were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent
letter , questionnaire , and follow-up _RARE_ were then revised into final form ( see _RARE_ A , B , and C )

mailing lists The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs
to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind
of companies were made and used in the study
was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of Washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work
consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers
list was derived from a group of approximately _RARE_ names supplied to the research team by the _RARE_ Industries Association
were secured from member companies by the Association from the _RARE_ sources listed in Appendix Aj
selected from its approved _RARE_ list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that _RARE_ in the production of weapons and weapon support systems
, the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address
lists supplied by the AIA member companies were _RARE_ and _RARE_ names were eliminated
further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive
names were then checked against the Thomas _RARE_ list ( see below ) and _RARE_ names were removed from the AIA lists
steps the final AIA list was reduced from _RARE_ to _RARE_
list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the Thomas _RARE_
compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the _RARE_ Industries Association were _RARE_ different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs
difference might have resulted from : 1
that the _RARE_ Industries Association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs

that companies on the AIA lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection
as `` _RARE_ '' , they might have different opinions and practices than an `` _RARE_ '' composed of those companies not so participating but interested in defense business

that AIA lists might not have been selected on a random basis
sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of manufacturers in the Thomas _RARE_
bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified , the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted
names were selected in this fashion

questionnaire Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm
were mailed in _RARE_ , Washington , and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Washington
used for the addresses outside the Pacific _RARE_
contained a _RARE_ return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the Pacific _RARE_ , and by _RARE_ for those outside the Pacific _RARE_
days after the questionnaire was mailed , a follow-up _RARE_ _RARE_ was sent to each of the original names
test mailing ( to 14 companies ) was made in June , 1960
test mailing ( to 100 companies ) was made in July , 1960
mailing of the questionnaire was made late in August , 1960 , to _RARE_ firms consisting of _RARE_ from the AIA list and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ list

Over _RARE_ returns were received within two weeks after the final mailing was made
to arrive until the end of December , 1960 , by which time a total of _RARE_ returns were received representing _RARE_ per cent of the _RARE_ questionnaires sent out
could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed
_RARE_ returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 2

returns Each questionnaire was _RARE_ for obvious _RARE_ and for comments , and was identified by a _RARE_ number , by the source list from which the company name was selected , and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the _RARE_ on the return envelope
, except comments , were _RARE_ _RARE_ to permit use of _RARE_ equipment
were _RARE_ into _RARE_ _RARE_ cards and _RARE_
required three cards and involved key _RARE_ _RARE_ digital columns
to be able to properly _RARE_ the data for a single company each of the three cards _RARE_ the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate _RARE_ number of the respondent
were then processed using standard _RARE_ _RARE_ card equipment , including an _RARE_ _RARE_ computer
step in processing was to _RARE_ the returns from _RARE_ 1 , 2 , and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses , in accordance with the _RARE_ contained in _RARE_ Section _RARE_
Chapter 2
results are shown in Table 3
from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms
step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the AIA list with those from companies on the _RARE_ list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to _RARE_ the responses for the purposes of the study
and results of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix Aj
concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in , or _RARE_ to sell to , defense programs
first place , the two groups of firms , when combined , had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the AIA list alone
Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world
summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic _RARE_ struggle
in this economic struggle are the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Committee ( _RARE_ ) of the _RARE_ and the agricultural _RARE_ of the State
of the legal responsibilities of the Department of _RARE_ in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces
not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have _RARE_ to maintain
sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose
one side was pleased and the other _RARE_ , regardless of how we ruled
_RARE_ parties interpreted our decision as _RARE_ _RARE_ toward the other
_RARE_ ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an _RARE_ proceeding
_RARE_ , nevertheless , to read in a labor weekly , `` _RARE_ knuckles down to _RARE_ '' , and then to be confronted with a _RARE_ publication which states , `` _RARE_ recognizes obviously phony and _RARE_ strikes as _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
number of years , there have been _RARE_ attempts in California to organize farm workers
met with little _RARE_ for a variety of reasons
_RARE_ financed , without experienced leadership , and _RARE_ the general support of organized labor as a whole
year the pattern has been different : The _RARE_ program had the full support of the _RARE_ , which supplied staff and money to the _RARE_ , as well as moral support
experienced and _RARE_ , and financial resources were significant
where personal _RARE_ may lie as between the parties , failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life
result of these changed conditions , the impact of the _RARE_ effort on agricultural _RARE_ relations has been much greater than in the past
has been able to _RARE_ the traditional weapons of labor -- the strike and the _RARE_ line -- with considerable success , particularly in the area of wages
very nature of the situation , it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management
, at least , the strategy of the _RARE_ has been selective ; ; that is to say , to concentrate on a particular _RARE_ or activity in a particular area at a strategic time , rather than any _RARE_ engagement with management throughout an area or the State
we became involved in these _RARE_ because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program
because agricultural labor is not covered by _RARE_ insurance , we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Code , although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility
current issues arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists , and out of Public Law _RARE_ and the _RARE_ Labor Agreement if Mexican _RARE_ were employed at the ranch
us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser Act in its historical sense , as a major _RARE_ in the development of public placement services
we think of it as a living , continuing , operating control over the system
when labor _RARE_ arise , its provisions come clearly into play
accepted the provisions of that Act ( as have all other States ) by _RARE_ into our Code ( Section _RARE_ ) a provision that The State of California _RARE_ the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act , and will observe and _RARE_ with the requirements of that act
to labor _RARE_ , the Wagner-Peyser Act states only , In carrying out the provisions of this Act , the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or _RARE_ to applicants before they are referred to employment
of the Act _RARE_ the Secretary to _RARE_ regulations necessary to carry out its provisions , and he has done so
_RARE_ for our purposes is Section _RARE_ ( , ) , as follows : _RARE_ in labor dispute situations
shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which ( 1 ) is vacant because the former _RARE_ is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute , or ( 2 ) the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute
to positions not covered by _RARE_ ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this _RARE_ , any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists , provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral
this _RARE_ , let us take the last sentence first
referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute , provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute
for example , a situation where a farm has a packing _RARE_ and fields
_RARE_ workers go on strike
no dispute involving _RARE_
that we may refer workers to the _RARE_ ( but not the packing _RARE_ work ) provided we give them written notice of the packing _RARE_ dispute
, no _RARE_ cases have _RARE_ under this provision
the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue
it _RARE_ referrals under either condition ( 1 ) or condition ( 2 )
have _RARE_ that the Secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a _RARE_ , on the grounds that the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists
The matter got into the courts this way : One of the early strikes called by the _RARE_ was at the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ County
that a labor dispute existed , and that the workers had left their jobs , which were then vacant because of the dispute
under clause ( 1 ) of the _RARE_ Regulation , we suspended referrals to the employer
, no Mexican _RARE_ were involved
employer , seeking to continue his _RARE_ , _RARE_ our right to cease referrals to him , and sought relief in the Superior Court of _RARE_ County
issued a temporary _RARE_ order , _RARE_ us to resume referrals
of course , _RARE_ the court order
the Attorney General of California , at the request of the Secretary of Labor , sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the Federal District Court , on grounds that it was _RARE_ a Federal issue since the validity of the _RARE_ Regulation was being _RARE_
the Federal Court held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act into its own Code , and presumably therefore also the regulations , it was now a State matter
refused to assume jurisdiction , _RARE_ the California Superior Court made the _RARE_ order permanent
order , we have continued referring workers to the ranch
case arose at the _RARE_ ranch in _RARE_ County , and the Superior Court of that county issued similar _RARE_ orders
have _RARE_ argued that I should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the _RARE_ Regulation
accept that view , either as a lawyer or as an administrator
First , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved
an accepted _RARE_ principle in California that a Superior Court decision does not constitute a binding legal _RARE_
conclusive , unless _RARE_ , only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard
not binding upon another Superior Court , which could rule to the contrary
a decision is rendered by the District Court of _RARE_ ( or , of course , the Supreme Court ) is a binding _RARE_ established
event , we can _RARE_ say that we have received an _RARE_ interpretation of the matter , and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be _RARE_ in other Superior _RARE_
and beyond the _RARE_ need for a binding _RARE_ decision , I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior _RARE_ which in effect _RARE_ the _RARE_ Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the _RARE_ power under the Federal law
I am in good company in this view
General of California _RARE_ in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the District Court of _RARE_
General of the United States , in considering the power of the Secretary to issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act relating to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of farm workers , has rendered an opinion _RARE_ his authority
and as an evidence of legislative intent only , the Senate of the United States recently _RARE_ by a substantial majority the `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' to the _RARE_ Labor _RARE_ Act , which would have specifically limited the _RARE_ authority of the Secretary in these matters
let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our _RARE_
far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in _RARE_
of the issue are enormous
to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to _RARE_ situations , and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as _RARE_
interest is so dominant in such an issue that I cannot be so _RARE_ as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior _RARE_ in the State
an issue which may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial _RARE_ is achieved
administrator , I cannot place the _RARE_ Service in California in _RARE_ of being out of _RARE_ with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the _RARE_ of appeal open to me
applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court , in my opinion , would have placed us clearly out of _RARE_ with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor , were he so inclined , to notify the Governor of such _RARE_ , set a date for hearing , and issue his finding
of _RARE_ under the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear : the _RARE_ of some _RARE_ million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or , as a _RARE_ , the taking over by the Federal Government of its operation
, the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike -- condition ( 1 ) in the Regulation of the Secretary
yet _RARE_ under condition ( 2 ) , relating to referral to jobs `` the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute ''
problem is essentially one of _RARE_ the word `` filling ''
be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job _RARE_ , union membership , union jurisdiction , and the like
it have a broader _RARE_ of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of `` filling '' the job
the uncertainty of this definition , I _RARE_ the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor
advised me that the _RARE_ interpretation is the proper one ; ; that is , that if wages , for example , is the only issue in a labor dispute , and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute , we may continue to make referrals

_RARE_ present evidence that _RARE_ and young children can and do _RARE_ many problems at a relatively simple _RARE_ level simply by _RARE_ objects and counting them
have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of _RARE_ objects ; ; they do _RARE_ what they once had to do _RARE_
to think seems to increase consistently with age
showed the greatest _RARE_ difference occurring between the _RARE_ and _RARE_ years

indicate that _RARE_ _RARE_ interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden
How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks _RARE_ him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics
amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and _RARE_ child is not likely to do well in school subjects
is the result of many factors , the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life
the teacher who _RARE_ the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly _RARE_ in helping pupils gain confidence , security , and satisfaction
responsibility of the teacher , suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 11
_RARE_ about the emotional characteristics of _RARE_ children may be helpful

the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time , as _RARE_ to those of an adult

child _RARE_ older , his emotional reactions lead to `` _RARE_ '' , or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly , rather than in short , abrupt _RARE_

the growth and decline of _RARE_ fears indicate that fears due to strange objects , _RARE_ , falling , and unexpected movement decline during the _RARE_ years , but that fears of the dark , of being alone , and of imaginary creatures or _RARE_ increase

child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem ; ; more effective solutions include explanations , the example of another child , or _RARE_ by _RARE_ the feared object , place , or person with something pleasant

help in learning to control their emotions
child _RARE_ from parents and teachers that _RARE_ _RARE_ , screaming , kicking , and _RARE_ will not get him what he wants ; ; the older child _RARE_ that intense emotional _RARE_ will not win approval by his _RARE_ , and , therefore , makes a real effort to control his emotions

widely in their emotional responses
the patterns of emotional responses are similar ; ; as the influence of learning and environment are felt , emotional behavior becomes _RARE_
Although no national norms exist for the social development of children , the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally _RARE_ by children at various age levels
summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of _RARE_ children ; ; the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the _RARE_ study of _RARE_ individuals , struggling to meet their _RARE_ needs , and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the _RARE_ number of groups in which they hold membership

childhood , children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children ; ; after they have been in school a few years , their interest in _RARE_ of their own age increases , and their interest in adults decreases ; ; the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on _RARE_ and family _RARE_ now _RARE_ it a bore
childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase ; ; the group sets the _RARE_ in clothing , the kind of play engaged in , and the _RARE_ of right and wrong behavior

childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older , who can do the things he _RARE_ to do ; ; such factors as sex , intelligence , and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time

childhood , an interest in team games _RARE_ individual play ; ; _RARE_ to the group , a feeling of _RARE_ over those who are not members , and _RARE_ to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant _RARE_

childhood boys _RARE_ and _RARE_ , on the average , more than girls ; ; those who feel _RARE_ or _RARE_ engage in these activities more than do _RARE_ children

childhood boys like to _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and talk smart to girls ; ; girls , who are more mature than boys , _RARE_ upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ of boys of their own age

time pupils reach the sixth grade , their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed ; ; they exhibit a keen interest in social , political , and economic problems , but they frequently have vague and _RARE_ _RARE_ about the terms they use rather _RARE_ in their routine school work

ages of two and four years , _RARE_ or resistance to adult authority is noticeable ; ; after the fourth year it begins to decline
as we have seen , in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the _RARE_ group for those of parents and teachers

child _RARE_ gradually in his ability to work in groups
in the primary grades can play _RARE_ with one companion , but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger ; ; he wants to be with people , but he hasn't yet learned to _RARE_
middle grades , however , he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader , helping to make plans and carry on group activities , and setting up rules governing the enterprise
teacher should study the individual pupil Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children , yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program
failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit ; ; others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom
have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand
systems now _RARE_ school _RARE_ and child guidance _RARE_
perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention , by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom , and by providing clinical services for severely _RARE_ children
the classroom teacher , however , who has daily contacts with pupils , and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice
a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the _RARE_ teacher , rather than merely an additional _RARE_
_RARE_ in many elementary schools have assumed that _RARE_ the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores _RARE_ the problem of meeting the needs of individuals
should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success , and that they still must be treated as individuals
teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards , he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability , background , and experience
inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment _RARE_ conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are _RARE_ emotionally , and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects
, which involved _RARE_ pupils in grades one to six , found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously _RARE_ and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity
apparent , therefore , that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children
child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow
in turn inhibit learning , and a vicious cycle is completed
easy for the teacher to _RARE_ that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy , or that the child who _RARE_ interest in school , who _RARE_ the teacher , or who is _RARE_ is a _RARE_ _RARE_
of _RARE_ and maladjustment may be found in physical factors , such as _RARE_ speech or hearing , _RARE_ vision , _RARE_ motor coordination , a frail _RARE_ , chronic disease , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_
be caused by poor health habits , such as _RARE_ eating and sleeping habits
be related to mental _RARE_ or lack of _RARE_ for certain types of school work
may be too difficult for some and too easy for others
, learning materials , and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to _RARE_ for some children
relations , broken homes , and _RARE_ community influences may also be contributing factors
only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children
these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner
_RARE_ that may produce nervous tension and reading _RARE_ for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading
home that may _RARE_ one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school
rate , the teacher who recognizes common causes of _RARE_ and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil _RARE_ , failure , and maladjustment
information about children _RARE_ teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he _RARE_ as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being _RARE_ by various factors in his environment
teacher cannot be expected to be as _RARE_ in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical _RARE_ ; ; he cannot be expected to _RARE_ all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom
be expected , however , to examine and interpret the information already available ; ; to _RARE_ and extend his own techniques for studying individual children ; ; and to _RARE_ opportunities , arising in connection with regular classroom activities , for _RARE_ a better understanding of his pupils
deals with some of the sources of information that can be _RARE_ by the classroom teacher ; ; Chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil progress
Most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils
, when _RARE_ maintained , provide much information about the children , which the teacher can use in guidance , instruction , _RARE_ , and reporting to parents
has in his classroom a metal file , equipped with a lock , which is used to store cumulative record _RARE_
vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal
teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records
teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date
systems provide written instructions to _RARE_ and teachers _RARE_ when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used
Report On _RARE_ _RARE_ In Education In The _RARE_ _RARE_ , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information
Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order
together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow
_RARE_ , as defined by the National Association of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia
and the _RARE_ _RARE_ all have some desegregation , in fact some _RARE_ back to 1954 ; ; but the region also _RARE_ some of the _RARE_ opposition
been opposed by massive resistance , _RARE_ , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate _RARE_
court order Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order

desegregation came to Owen and Union _RARE_ , which already had high school desegregation
was a result of a court order , the _RARE_ for which ( and for other court action mentioned in this paper ) is taken from the Summary Report for this Conference
the _RARE_ County Board of Education had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but which a _RARE_ had _RARE_ ; ; thus , county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation
desegregation in Tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel
further desegregation may come from suits pending in three Tennessee cities , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
Virginia the number of white and Negro children _RARE_ the same school has increased almost _RARE_
no court decisions here
Maryland , a District court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in Delaware
result of the State Board of Education plan , Negro children entered _RARE_ white elementary schools in five districts
_RARE_ Court of _RARE_ is _RARE_ an appeal from the plan
court orders led to desegregation in _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ County is pending because of court order , although date of admission is not yet determined
have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Warren _RARE_
also result from additional suits brought by Negro _RARE_ against school boards in Newport News , _RARE_ County , _RARE_ County , and _RARE_
school district , the District of Columbia has had _RARE_ schools since 1954 , shortly after the Supreme Court decision
makes it clear that school desegregation continues , including the Old _RARE_ State , in spite of its stern resistance
is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order ; ; that on the immediate horizon , if further _RARE_ ( relatively speaking ) desegregation comes , it will result from court orders on suits filed in several _RARE_ states
thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a _RARE_ in _RARE_ leads to a conclusion that _RARE_ is slow
to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this _RARE_ Conference , I wish to note a small item in the Summary Report as it refers to the District of Columbia
in the Report is `` continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro school system '' , a remark apparently _RARE_ by the increase of Negro school population from _RARE_ per cent to _RARE_ per cent
no real prospects for an all-Negro school population
Rock _RARE_ _RARE_ is still _RARE_ white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of _RARE_ _RARE_ housing program
Bottom is _RARE_ Negroes
_RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ area _RARE_ white people -- what with _RARE_ town houses and elevator apartments
_RARE_ rehabilitation , like _RARE_ Bottom , _RARE_ Negroes with whites ( but also _RARE_ some whites with other whites )
break with tradition , the past and present of `` White _RARE_ _RARE_ a Black _RARE_ '' , may come with the opening of nearby _RARE_ County suburbs to Negro _RARE_ and , presumably , the consequent conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the Negro by fleeing to the suburbs
, short of fleeing to _RARE_ , Virginia , or _RARE_ , Maryland , white people may have to live with Negroes
this must be taken into account before the image of an `` all-Negro '' D.C. public school system is _RARE_ up
_RARE_ From the Summary Report before us at this Conference , a number of problems are apparent
us and _RARE_ us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems
how can we step up the desegregation movement
slow
we all want more schools where white and Negro together can and do attend
we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color
, members of _RARE_ would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence _RARE_
achieve this objective is a problem , but we are not divided on what we want
as we increase the number of _RARE_ school districts and schools themselves , how can we achieve this action through school board action
be county school board or state school board action , as well as that of municipal school boards
can we reduce the role of the district courts , so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court
a problem , and I believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should _RARE_ and effect a plan of desegregation
how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools
a brief program when the schools are actually _RARE_ but a continuing program that also _RARE_ integration , that _RARE_ the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro , but as human beings
problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education ; ; not whether it should be done
in the segregated school system , during the period before desegregation , how can we assure equal opportunity
, in the _RARE_ school system which may have a good many schools with all-Negro population , how can we assure equal opportunity
a problem , but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence
in the segregated school system or in the all-Negro or _RARE_ schools , how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group
help children adjust to `` images of other children '' when the latter are not actually present
the issues If we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively _RARE_ fashion , then there are twice as many issues which , I judge , sharply divide us , _RARE_ relations _RARE_ and lay people
1

the one hand school desegregation has come in Virginia _RARE_ with pupil assignment , shall we support the plan
basis of pupil assignment criteria , _RARE_ Albert _RARE_ has assigned Negro children to _RARE_ white schools in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , Virginia
support pupil assignment
other hand , looking at the larger picture , is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off , blocked , or reduced school desegregation to a `` _RARE_ ''
therefore _RARE_ the plan
is an issue because it likely divides us into two camps -- those for or against pupil assignment
2
in order to _RARE_
cities like Baltimore , _RARE_ , and Washington , D.C. , should school desegregation be extended to all-Negro and _RARE_ schools by _RARE_ white and Negro teachers , respectively
one hand do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race
we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an _RARE_ school , we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school -- namely , to a teacher of another race
argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially _RARE_ situation
3
in school desegregation cases
part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation
instance the _RARE_ was a private citizen
of school districts , indeed , in the entire State of _RARE_ , no _RARE_ has come forth
have established that the action of municipal , county , or state school boards or boards of education is small , _RARE_ small in comparison with the number of districts
requirement that the _RARE_ be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement
_RARE_ the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance
in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the Attorney General to act was eliminated , should we nevertheless support such a clause
an issue , for it divides people rather sharply
4
funds to schools that deny children on account of race
the Powell _RARE_ , which in 1957 divided even a `` liberal '' group like the American _RARE_ Committee ( _RARE_ )
support a clause in Federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny Federal funds to a school district that _RARE_ admission to a child on account of his race
_RARE_ than earlier Powell _RARE_ which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts
_RARE_ considerable argument against the clause , _RARE_ though it be , on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools
funds _RARE_ _RARE_ the support of many , the opposition of quite a few
5
education
political _RARE_ , state or county or _RARE_ , be required to furnish public education
school year , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ Edward County ( Virginia ) Board of _RARE_ voted not to provide funds for public education , and the school board therefore could provide no public education -- for white or Negro children
education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education
this subject a matter of _RARE_ , a matter of states rights or county rights
don't want to provide public education , should they be forced to do so
we _RARE_ substantial agreement behind _RARE_ public education , we likely cannot expect that all the states will _RARE_ the legislation
requirement , which must therefore be Federal in nature , be _RARE_ by the United States Congress
it become law by _RARE_ of the United States _RARE_
have two issues in this question -- goal and method
6
for education of the citizens
above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens , Issue No. 6 may be _RARE_
on the other hand , it is not settled , or while it is being _RARE_ and _RARE_ , does the Federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in _RARE_ Edward County
the children still receive no education
should the Federal government help
government directly provide education for the children who want public education
question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational _RARE_
whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way
there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn
issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for _RARE_ youth
of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education
the records of _RARE_ school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence '' , as _RARE_ by a panel of professional _RARE_ who studied the voting records on educational issues
cases of clear _RARE_ along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for _RARE_ rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy
, it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society
been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy
were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the _RARE_ favor their own social classes
currently a major _RARE_ of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged
the issue of segregated schools in the South
case it is primarily a matter of conflict of _RARE_ groups rather than social-class groups
the white middle and lower classes are _RARE_ against the Negro middle and lower classes
may be _RARE_ in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people
happens , there may be some class conflict in the South , with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position
profession The members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy , their position being strongest in the universities
mostly _RARE_ and _RARE_ people , with a few in the upper class
make _RARE_ decisions
society _RARE_ by middle-class values and working in an institution which _RARE_ and _RARE_ these social values , it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society
no problem here
_RARE_ , if it does arise , when the _RARE_ has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence , but which bears some relation to the social structure
, in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college scholarship , does he _RARE_ or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class
in deciding on the content and method of his teaching , does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger _RARE_ in the race for higher economic status , or does he favor a curriculum which _RARE_ students in other ways
to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the _RARE_ own social-class position and also upon his social history , as well as upon his personality and what he _RARE_ his mission to be as an _RARE_
set of case studies of teachers with various social-class _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the _RARE_ personality as well as on his social-class background
teacher may be a hard _RARE_ for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb , while another _RARE_ teacher may be a very _RARE_ person with lower-class pupils because he knows their _RARE_ and _RARE_ at home , and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment
factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and _RARE_ families
experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers
influence is a complex matter , depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience , there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth
have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them ; ; that is , they are likely to favor a kind of education that has _RARE_ value
not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education , as _RARE_ with liberal education , but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a _RARE_ _RARE_ value , as against a kind of `` pure '' liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs
no doubt that higher education since World War 2 , has moved away from `` pure '' liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and _RARE_
several causes for this , one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training
cause may lie in the experience of so many new _RARE_ faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social _RARE_
the college and university faculty members of the period from _RARE_ to _RARE_ , the new _RARE_ faculty members consist of more children of _RARE_ and more children of urban _RARE_ _RARE_
is quite in contrast with that of children of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ parents , who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational _RARE_ in the curriculum
public interest '' groups _RARE_ policies are formed by several groups who are officially or _RARE_ appointed to act in the public interest
one such group , and state _RARE_ have major responsibility for educational legislation
vote so as to serve their own _RARE_ , and if the _RARE_ should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class , they might be expected to vote and work for _RARE_ or for lower-class interests in education
there are relatively few such political _RARE_ , and , as has been pointed out , there is seldom a _RARE_ distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another
interest group is the commission of _RARE_ or _RARE_ which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations
_RARE_ work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it
their conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody , and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view
, there have been two Presidential _RARE_ on higher education since World War 2
Commission on _RARE_ Education tended to take a liberal , _RARE_ position , while President _RARE_ Committee on Education Beyond the _RARE_ School was slightly more conservative
consisted of _RARE_ and _RARE_ people , who attempted to act in the public interest
of a more definite class _RARE_ is noted in proceedings of the Commission on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Education sponsored by the Association of American _RARE_ and supported by the _RARE_ Foundation and the _RARE_ Corporation
recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of _RARE_ _RARE_
be said to be an _RARE_ or an _RARE_ _RARE_ , but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by Byron S. _RARE_ entitled Who Should Go To College
a federal government scholarship program
the Commission set up the Council for _RARE_ _RARE_ to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education
the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own _RARE_ about the problem of government support to private education
are the trustees and officers of the great educational _RARE_ , who inevitably _RARE_ an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs , experiments , and _RARE_
are practically always _RARE_ or _RARE_ persons , who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society
are the parent organizations and the _RARE_ organizations such as the National Association of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ Committee on Public _RARE_
an _RARE_ leadership and a middle-class membership , with rare exceptions , where _RARE_ parents are active in local _RARE_ matters
other _RARE_ groups , these are middle class in their educational attitudes , and they attempt to act in the general public interest , as they see it
, it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who _RARE_ to act in the interests of the society as a whole
_RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ people , and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes
be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account
is very little _RARE_ and conscious _RARE_ of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education
of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society
influence social structure through education _RARE_ policy in the United States has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity
far as this goal is achieved , the society becomes more fluid , artificial barriers to social _RARE_ are reduced , and people at the lower end of the social _RARE_ share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society
other hand , there is a _RARE_ purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children
to efforts at _RARE_ through private schools and to the maintenance of social _RARE_ in the schools
these purposes exist side by side without much _RARE_ conflict under present conditions
and cultural opportunity The broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting _RARE_ within the social structure
ago the general raising of the _RARE_ age to sixteen was an example of this movement
past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities , state colleges , and community colleges
of American faith in the comprehensive high school , as expressed in the _RARE_ study , is another indication of the _RARE_ of the ideal of _RARE_ opportunity through the _RARE_ of educational opportunity
federal _RARE_ _RARE_ program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to _RARE_ youth
probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade , because the scholarship programs mainly _RARE_ the students with the best academic records ( who were usually middle-class ) , and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges
the private colleges have increased their _RARE_ rates so much that they have raised an economic _RARE_ which _RARE_ their scholarship funds
in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions
however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely _RARE_ as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues
fact may explain some of the _RARE_ among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service
_RARE_ , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the _RARE_ of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs
the choice is that between the _RARE_ of a dilemma
types of fully distributed cost analysis 1
type Despite an _RARE_ due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above _RARE_ of fully distributed _RARE_ goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice
explicit _RARE_ , one must distinguish different types of analyses
means the most important distinction is that between those _RARE_ _RARE_ which _RARE_ a distribution of _RARE_ _RARE_ cost _RARE_ on estimates of _RARE_ or marginal costs , and those other _RARE_ which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere _RARE_ distribution
, or _RARE_ , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the _RARE_ Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission
Section _RARE_ between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter
costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` _RARE_ _RARE_ costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ marginal costs ''
a _RARE_ of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly _RARE_ on a _RARE_ basis
because the _RARE_ Section has felt _RARE_ to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has apportioned this _RARE_ , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , among the units of _RARE_ traffic on a basis ( partly _RARE_ , partly _RARE_ ) which is _RARE_ quite arbitrary from the _RARE_ of cost determination
years , this burden ( which includes _RARE_ for revenue _RARE_ in the _RARE_ business and in _RARE_ freight traffic
_RARE_ to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the _RARE_ freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet
book is concerned only _RARE_ with railroad rates , it will not attempt to _RARE_ the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated _RARE_ costs and apportioned _RARE_ costs
to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is _RARE_
any event , full credit should be given to the _RARE_ Section for its express and _RARE_ recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in _RARE_ analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ; and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of specific cost determination

type We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment : the _RARE_ type
be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases
attempt is made , first to determine _RARE_ or marginal costs and then to _RARE_ on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' _RARE_ of total costs
all of the total costs are treated as variable costs , although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables
whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission _RARE_ `` variable cost '' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output , in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost '' has been used more _RARE_ , so as to cover costs which , while a function of some one variable ( such as output of energy , or number of customers ) , are not necessarily a linear function
noted in an earlier _RARE_ , the more familiar cost analyses of utility _RARE_ or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc.
grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their _RARE_ to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be _RARE_ completely from some important class or classes
power service , for example , would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the _RARE_ distribution lines
major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all , or nearly all , classes of customers ; ; and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be _RARE_ among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates
basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly _RARE_ problem of an _RARE_ cost analysis
turning to this example , we must distinguish two _RARE_ of analysis , both of which belong to the _RARE_ type rather than to the _RARE_ type
first _RARE_ , the _RARE_ ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) _RARE_ both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service
an apportionment , say , of _RARE_ of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential _RARE_
the second _RARE_ , which I take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are apportioned directly among the various classes of service
sure , the capital _RARE_ in ( or , _RARE_ , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services
resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs _RARE_ to this class is reported as a `` return '' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service
during any given year ( A ) if the revenues from the residential service are _RARE_ , ( B ) if the operating expenses _RARE_ to this class of service come to _RARE_ , and ( C ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to _RARE_ , the cost _RARE_ will report that residential service , in the aggregate , has yielded a return of _RARE_ or _RARE_ per cent
will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher
obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return ''
practice is likely to be _RARE_ , since it may seem to support a conclusion that , as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the _RARE_ operating expenses plus some return on capital investment , however low , the rates of charge for this service are _RARE_
say , any such inference would be quite _RARE_
reason just suggested , I shall assume the use of the first _RARE_ of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following _RARE_ example
to say , an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment
of the costs of an electric utility business In order to simplify the _RARE_ of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own _RARE_ plant
also assume the existence of only one class or type of service , all of which is supplied at the same voltage , phase , etc. to residential , commercial , and industrial customers
assumption will permit us to center attention on the most _RARE_ aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of _RARE_ of the same service measured along different dimensions
company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service , we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple ; ; indeed , that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business , followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per _RARE_ of consumption
, however , the problem is not so simple
statement of costs per _RARE_ would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of _RARE_ output ( or consumption ) of energy
of multiple cost functions is therefore required
division , and the one most frequently used ( with _RARE_ ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a _RARE_ division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` _RARE_ costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs
_RARE_ division of costs were to have its _RARE_ in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a _RARE_ rate for any one class of service
, the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge , a _RARE_ charge for _RARE_ _RARE_ of energy at per _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ charge for a maximum demand of 2 _RARE_ during the month at the rate of $1 per _RARE_ -- a total bill of _RARE_ for that month
present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service , and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs
therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , _RARE_ that this _RARE_ classification is used only for _RARE_ purposes ; ; costs actually vary in much more complex ways

costs These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption
a minimum are the costs of _RARE_ and _RARE_ along with whatever other expenses the company must _RARE_ in taking on another consumer
costs may come to $1 per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial users , who require more _RARE_ connections and _RARE_ devices
on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates , in the form of a mere `` service charge '' , they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which _RARE_ the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment
really _RARE_ aspect of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ because of the cost _RARE_ frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be definitely _RARE_ as _RARE_ for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( _RARE_ ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity
of sociology have remained largely _RARE_ by the _RARE_
numbers in _RARE_ , the entire _RARE_ framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth
is the operational worth of a sociology which _RARE_ _RARE_ the idea of physical models
not the task of philosophy to see what _RARE_ meaning can be assigned to the most sacred _RARE_ in social science
become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by _RARE_ _RARE_ and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which _RARE_ a _RARE_ price for technological _RARE_
to _RARE_ the study of mass _RARE_ to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology _RARE_ close to the reduction of the word `` mass '' to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied
_RARE_ , 1959 : : _RARE_ 11
I think the role of the _RARE_ becomes apparent
_RARE_ success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned
the small group notion involves the _RARE_ claim that the phenomena of _RARE_ investigations are of atomic or _RARE_ proportions , the _RARE_ needs to know the extent to which such _RARE_ are valid
exploration of the unconscious ground of _RARE_ sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation
_RARE_ , 1959 : : _RARE_ 12
parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between _RARE_ _RARE_ received and _RARE_ logically formed
supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially _RARE_ categories
a _RARE_ of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement
sociology may have great practical use in the study of different _RARE_ , yet it is perfectly clear , as _RARE_ ( 1957 : : _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ ( 1959 : : _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) indicate , that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models , in which the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , i.e. , metaphysical purpose , are central
Chapter 9
as a _RARE_ credo is , therefore , not a direct consequence of observations , but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment
of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to _RARE_ but to _RARE_ the principles of social science
absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology , since the former is a logical , rational discipline , where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical
position _RARE_ the _RARE_ of philosophy in its _RARE_ form as something _RARE_ above and _RARE_ the empirical and _RARE_ sciences
to _RARE_ , philosophy is not a _RARE_ for _RARE_
of philosophy as a logical clearing house are _RARE_ to any approach that does not _RARE_ to pure _RARE_
when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences , to _RARE_ the conditions of empirical research , it becomes formal metaphysics ; ; _RARE_ the contours of life to fit the needs of _RARE_
of philosophy as _RARE_ _RARE_ may fit well with _RARE_ _RARE_ of political _RARE_ , but it has been noted that the price of such an _RARE_ notion of philosophy is the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the social sciences
_RARE_ , 1952 : : _RARE_ 2 , _RARE_ 5 ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_
is no longer a direct _RARE_ with nature as it was in _RARE_
_RARE_ any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of _RARE_ , as in _RARE_ system ( _RARE_ )
_RARE_ for _RARE_ to know nothing of Nothing , in a last ditch effort to save the _RARE_ at the expense of men
not _RARE_ which has isolated metaphysics from reality by _RARE_ between description and _RARE_
simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century
traditional `` four fields '' of philosophy : logic , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_
a _RARE_ that to the degree these special _RARE_ of past _RARE_ hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable _RARE_ criteria , they move away from philosophy as such
left to traditional systems of philosophy is , in effect , only the history of these fields prior to their becoming _RARE_ enough to _RARE_ by the _RARE_ of scientific method
situation , philosophy has survived by _RARE_ itself from metaphysics , by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions
by philosophy of _RARE_ claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its _RARE_ attitude to knowledge of more humble _RARE_
new situation , philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that _RARE_ offers the physical sciences , a _RARE_ of logical relations that can be used in _RARE_ _RARE_ having _RARE_ and _RARE_ value
, philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry , but within its potential _RARE_ of _RARE_
connection , it might be noted that the theory of games was a _RARE_ discovery long before its uses in political science were _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ hypothesis , according to which the solar system was _RARE_ from a rotating mass of _RARE_ gas , nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by _RARE_ in his _RARE_ Du _RARE_
not mean that philosophy _RARE_ the problems it _RARE_ , any more so than _RARE_ geometry settled the physical status of the _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a _RARE_ task
raised on _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , this may seem a modest role for philosophy
_RARE_ and _RARE_ are different qualities
of as _RARE_ to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which _RARE_ as the sciences _RARE_
effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has _RARE_ since its primitive _RARE_ status offers a more _RARE_ sort of drama
fundamental _RARE_ in the social sciences , and _RARE_ the logical problems _RARE_ at the _RARE_ of each new scientific discipline , philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can _RARE_ growth in human understanding
prevent the working _RARE_ from becoming _RARE_ and _RARE_ by _RARE_ the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed
of scientific theory , the examination of a theory from the _RARE_ of language , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge , no less so because of its removal from empirical research
of science , whatever the degree of precision in formulations , covers the range of _RARE_ and explanation
_RARE_ and _RARE_ , 1948 : : _RARE_ - 75
philosophy is conceived to be , its _RARE_ , _RARE_ attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science
forms of philosophy , this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical _RARE_ of the latter
_RARE_ announce that `` the secret is the center of a philosophy '' and thereafter a hundred followers _RARE_ _RARE_ a higher _RARE_
simply a confession of intellectual _RARE_ _RARE_ up to look _RARE_
_RARE_ indicated ( 1953 ) , it is not the secret which is important , but the removal of _RARE_
, philosophy and science share a common goal
of the secret _RARE_ _RARE_ that the division of _RARE_ and synthetic _RARE_ shall not be overcome by even the most _RARE_ argument ; ; for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between _RARE_ and science
of metaphysical systems does not imply the _RARE_ of philosophy , only the close of a _RARE_ age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical
with which present metaphysical attitudes _RARE_ private _RARE_ offers the strongest evidence that the _RARE_ between scientific and _RARE_ ways of _RARE_ is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science , religion and _RARE_
_RARE_ : 1958
systems , and this includes even the relation of _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ , are built upon , _RARE_ and _RARE_
, by the very nature of their _RARE_ , are _RARE_ by _RARE_ systems
to the _RARE_ of science and the _RARE_ of metaphysics , they differ in that science is essentially descriptive , while philosophy in its inherited forms , tends to be _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_
notion that belief , unlike _RARE_ , is not subject to objective analysis , has placed _RARE_ metaphysics _RARE_ against the sociology of knowledge , since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less _RARE_ than social _RARE_
with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge , or better the role of philosophy in _RARE_ research on the social sources of ideas , one has to become necessarily selective
we have touched upon : philosophy as a logical , _RARE_ system from which a social science _RARE_ can be built up ; ; _RARE_ analysis of the assumptions and _RARE_ of the social sciences ; ; and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ investigations
will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted , namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms _RARE_ in the social sciences
it will be asked whether the `` real '' questions people ask are not the `` ultimate '' questions that social science finds itself _RARE_ in the face of
is the status of such questions as : is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual goal
develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals
really exist as an _RARE_ over and above the _RARE_ of men
it must be said that , contrary to metaphysical insistence , these are questions so framed as to _RARE_ either empirical exploration or rational solutions
( _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) indicated , questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions , but _RARE_ of faith made to appear as _RARE_ questions
assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving _RARE_ _RARE_
has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions , than _RARE_ has the right to expect a _RARE_ solution to the _RARE_ _RARE_
not that such questions are not asked
rather that _RARE_ them into social analysis _RARE_ not so much a search for truth as for certainty
approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty , since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either _RARE_ or _RARE_
the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds , answers to ultimate questions having an _RARE_ rather than scientific basis , is in a real sense to _RARE_ the objection itself
concerns all scientific _RARE_ is precisely that which can be _RARE_ for the rational , i.e. , for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and _RARE_
which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of men , an impatience with _RARE_ , tentative solutions
always lived in a tentative world , and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary
itself is the _RARE_ of the quest for new and more precise information about the world
uncertainty we are left with a set of _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ of philosophy and science should , as a minimum , _RARE_ a meaningful _RARE_ to _RARE_
of _RARE_ is a _RARE_ condition for the growth of science
was the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or _RARE_ that could be seen or heard
they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value
a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to _RARE_ the theory _RARE_ , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery
that the theory could be saved in one way only
could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they _RARE_ nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` _RARE_ '' or `` _RARE_ '' , then these _RARE_ judgments would cease from _RARE_ and weary heads could be at rest
the course the _RARE_ took
value judgments by explaining them away
do not think their view will do
discussing it , I should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case
been said of John Stuart _RARE_ that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out
has been put so clearly and precisely that it _RARE_ criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply
claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking
argue that we do mean to do just that
work through an example , and the _RARE_ and _RARE_ the better
perhaps no value statement on which people would more _RARE_ agree than the statement that intense pain is bad
take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement
upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the _RARE_ traps in common use
signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a _RARE_ of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all but eaten off its own leg
failed : the animal is now dead
think of the long and _RARE_ pain it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so ''
tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion
, on the contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it was bad -- bad when and as it occurred
follows from the positivist view
view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came on the scene and made my remark
I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time , and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene
of the rabbit was not itself bad ; ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being _RARE_ ; ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at all , waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt
this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows
put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered
prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did

we should say , on the contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the _RARE_ pain , that it would have been every _RARE_ as bad whether a chance _RARE_ happened later to discover the body and feel _RARE_ or not
, then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only
saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it
argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference
our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be
argument applies the method in the reverse way
_RARE_ the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not
suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all , but that we _RARE_ believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing
positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second
only sense in which badness is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its _RARE_ , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there
question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant
is not
asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were _RARE_ to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our _RARE_ was in that case mistaken
that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely frivolous
did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred
theory before us , such relief would be _RARE_ , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all , and hence in its _RARE_ there would be nothing to be relieved about
theory would here _RARE_ our meaning beyond recognition
as I can see , there is only one way out for the positivist
that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or _RARE_
is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case _RARE_ our own feeling of _RARE_ without belonging to the pain itself
in itself was neutral ; ; but _RARE_ the rabbit , on no grounds at all , took up toward this neutral object an attitude of _RARE_ and that made it for the first time , and in the only _RARE_ sense , bad
of escape is _RARE_ possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so far as I know , been urged by _RARE_ , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it
now to a third argument , which again is very simple
come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; ; the _RARE_ are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling
that a week later we _RARE_ to the incident in thought and make our statement again
that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded
evidence is no longer before us ; ; and we are now so _RARE_ in body and mind that feeling is , as we say , quite dead
circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now _RARE_ nothing
as empty as the word `` _RARE_ '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it
seems to me _RARE_
repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing , the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the _RARE_ point , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer Yes
say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making
we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express
now to a fourth consideration
believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not ; ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense
Ross have lately _RARE_ that this _RARE_ is one of the main facts of _RARE_ , and I suspect they are right
is not exactly my point
is this : whether there is such _RARE_ or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the _RARE_ say we do
illustrate
novel The House Of The Dead , _RARE_ tells of his experiences in a _RARE_ prison camp
unhappy _RARE_ of such camps are like today , _RARE_ _RARE_ were about as grim a lot as can be imagined
have heard stories '' , he _RARE_ , `` of the most terrible , the most _RARE_ actions , of the most monstrous _RARE_ , told with the most spontaneous , _RARE_ _RARE_ laughter ''
us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very _RARE_
were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly _RARE_
the _RARE_ view , this answer is ruled out
someone takes up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their _RARE_ , they have no moral quality at all
therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or _RARE_ could be fitting
in themselves neutral , and , so far as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the _RARE_
that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other
, for example , be fitting if , apart from the _RARE_ , there were nothing good to _RARE_
be fitting if , independently of the _RARE_ , there were nothing bad to _RARE_
a case , any attitude would be as fitting or _RARE_ as any other , which means that the notion of _RARE_ has lost all point
we are forced to go much farther
and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ laughter are taking the only _RARE_ line
is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral _RARE_ only from our feeling about them , why shouldn't they be greeted with a _RARE_
them with _RARE_ would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; ; it would _RARE_ bring badness into the world ; ; and even on _RARE_ assumptions that does not seem very bright
other hand , to _RARE_ them with delight would _RARE_ what before was neutral into something good ; ; it would bring goodness into the world
German veteran was a former _RARE_ , _RARE_ years old , who had been wounded by _RARE_ in the back of the head
in damage to the _RARE_ _RARE_ and very probably to the left side of the _RARE_ also
event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` _RARE_ blind '' , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact
is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual _RARE_ , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to _RARE_ up a _RARE_ of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence
in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order _RARE_ its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is _RARE_ that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , _RARE_ ) awareness _RARE_
inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( ( 1 ) _RARE_ qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such
not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself
) _RARE_ becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations ; ; that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space ''
assumption , of course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully _RARE_ way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other _RARE_ being _RARE_ _RARE_ , if not totally inadequate , in this regard
an assumption with which few would be _RARE_ to quarrel
if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a _RARE_ person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems _RARE_ that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the _RARE_ of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary
of the _RARE_ analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered
) What allows us to think that the patient had no _RARE_ representations when his eyes were closed
) What evidence is there that he was _RARE_ blind
) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not _RARE_ disturbed by his head injury
consider these in the _RARE_ order of their presentation
a satisfactory answer to the third question is _RARE_ , if the argument is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ , any findings _RARE_ in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion
the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance
as follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of _RARE_ ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as well as the _RARE_ _RARE_ ( muscular feelings , feelings in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ ) , were , as such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in comparison with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body
tactual sense of spatial location and _RARE_ in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as well as the direction and scope of a movement , _RARE_ _RARE_ ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on the contrary , very considerably affected ''
insist , however , that these _RARE_ in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic _RARE_ in that sense faculty but rather to the _RARE_ which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight
all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was _RARE_ _RARE_
) When an object was placed in the patient's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or _RARE_ , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and so on
could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; ; that is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was
) The patient _RARE_ an _RARE_ efficiency in a new trade
his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line of work , that of a _RARE_ , an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly _RARE_ sense of form and _RARE_
clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly _RARE_ _RARE_ of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the _RARE_ blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual _RARE_ and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision
the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his _RARE_ life and in his work , even more than the foregoing facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave _RARE_ no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was _RARE_ ; ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the _RARE_ of the tactual apparatus , from the _RARE_ up to the tactual centers in the brain , -- that is , from one end to the other -- was _RARE_ ''
argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in _RARE_ himself _RARE_ and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his _RARE_ visual condition
we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand
ways , then , did the patient's _RARE_ blindness _RARE_ itself
not see objects as unified , _RARE_ , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision
of this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual _RARE_ of objects as objects ; ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even _RARE_ things upon seeing them again
he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of _RARE_ objects , and so on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours
his own testimony , he never actually saw things as _RARE_ but only as generally _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' of color of a more or less _RARE_ size ; ; at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether
the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously _RARE_ manner , find the _RARE_ form ; ; could piece , as it were , the _RARE_ mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a _RARE_ or whatever it turned out to be
however , the figure to be _RARE_ were complicated , composed of several _RARE_ _RARE_ , and so on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts
, _RARE_ , that the patient could not read at all without making _RARE_ movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` _RARE_ marks '' inserted between _RARE_ words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it
himself denied that he had any visual _RARE_ at all ; ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to _RARE_ him
conversation with another man , he was able to _RARE_ practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like
he call up _RARE_ of close friends or relatives
, both his own _RARE_ and his _RARE_ blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present _RARE_ evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all
_RARE_ of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do
not recognize it ; ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all
his only _RARE_ was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; ; and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure
might finally recognize it , apparently by _RARE_ the visual _RARE_ , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements
mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience , the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual _RARE_
would _RARE_ , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual _RARE_ and the _RARE_ beginning of the tracing movement would provide _RARE_ as to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference
trees , automobiles , houses , and so on -- objects continually confronted in everyday life -- had each its characteristic _RARE_ and became easily _RARE_ , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as to what each was
for example , he _RARE_ from black dots on a white surface
could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away
authors give numerous instances of calculated _RARE_ on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of _RARE_ himself and how _RARE_ he became at it
seems even to have been able to guess _RARE_ , without the tracing motions , solely on the basis of _RARE_ differences among the _RARE_ things which appeared in his visual experience
very important question -- What is , then , exactly the role of _RARE_ _RARE_ in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things
now been raised in the _RARE_ mind and in the following form
patient can perceive figure _RARE_ when he cannot perceive it _RARE_ , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on the part of _RARE_ touch is denied by the authors
then , do the _RARE_ _RARE_ function in all this
set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability , _RARE_ , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned away from the object concerned )
, they make the investigation , first , by _RARE_ the patient from making any movements at all and then , later , by _RARE_ it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to
patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all , the following striking results occurred
, indeed , turned to actual representations or _RARE_ three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ ) ; ; a _RARE_ , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century
of this underlying view of the world is to _RARE_ upon matters of subjective judgment
least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric _RARE_ and the _RARE_ line
, again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the _RARE_ of life
an _RARE_ of the vases will not go too far in _RARE_ that the outlook of their _RARE_ and users was basically stable and secure
of the past had died away , and the great _RARE_ which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to _RARE_ men's minds
work of the later _RARE_ century a calm , severe _RARE_ _RARE_ itself
vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or _RARE_ one in its internal _RARE_ , but the best of the Geometric _RARE_ have _RARE_ been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world
century was in its artistic work `` the _RARE_ _RARE_ and most _RARE_ between past and future '' , and the _RARE_ skill spent by its artists upon their products is a _RARE_ to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated
in 800 B.C. Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it _RARE_ , partly because the task is a _RARE_ one and partly because some of its local _RARE_ , as at _RARE_ , are only now coming to light
a _RARE_ inspection of its many aspects , however , the _RARE_ can _RARE_ several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C.
intellectual outlook which had appeared in the _RARE_ century was now _RARE_ to a significant degree
was in _RARE_ in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800
process the _RARE_ _RARE_ had been _RARE_ or finally rejected ; ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800
scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental _RARE_ of Aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional _RARE_ of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct ; ; but all too many observers have been _RARE_ by this fact into _RARE_ the degree of change which took place in the early first _RARE_
of _RARE_ in this world now lay in the _RARE_ districts of the Greek _RARE_ , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always _RARE_ its northern _RARE_ , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery
vases usually turn up , especially outside _RARE_ proper , together with as many or more examples of local _RARE_ , these `` _RARE_ '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later _RARE_ century
place came local variations within the common style -- tentative , as it were , in _RARE_ products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed
though important , was not the only teacher of this age
take a _RARE_ of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; ; _RARE_ and _RARE_ of _RARE_ now become _RARE_
of the Aegean _RARE_ thus stood apart from those of the _RARE_ , and in _RARE_ itself _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other Geometric _RARE_ have each their own _RARE_
variations were to become ever _RARE_ in the next century and a half
conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the _RARE_ of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages
B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture
_RARE_ rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be _RARE_ in the remarkably _RARE_ _RARE_ of the Iliad
the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; ; Greek history and culture were _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , by the _RARE_ of these _RARE_ yet opposed factors
cannot go , for the Dark ages deserve their name
of civilization were not yet sufficiently _RARE_ to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social _RARE_ of this world support a _RARE_ structure
poems , the consolidation of the Greek _RARE_ , the rise of firm political units , the _RARE_ which could permit painted and _RARE_ representations of men -- all these had to _RARE_ the progress of following decades
have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search
the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ outlook , independent of outside forces
, indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate _RARE_ born of our lack of detailed information ; ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong _RARE_ which came to an end within the period
can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future _RARE_ will _RARE_ our understanding
Dark ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently
could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood on firm ground
the early eighth century the landscape of Greek history _RARE_ widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ of the new day cannot yet _RARE_ all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; ; but our evidence _RARE_ considerably in variety and shows more _RARE_ some of the lines of change
period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; ; the _RARE_ material of the age is more _RARE_ , more _RARE_ , and more _RARE_ of the hopes and fears of its _RARE_ , who begin to show scenes of human life and death
simple _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ of sculpture and _RARE_ in _RARE_ ; ; objects in gold , ivory , and _RARE_ grow more numerous
was _RARE_ in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful
is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this _RARE_ product of the epic tradition had certainly taken _RARE_ shape by _RARE_
Geometric pottery of _RARE_ and the Iliad are amazing _RARE_ of the inherent _RARE_ of Greek civilization ; ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending
was _RARE_ toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the _RARE_ outlook were suddenly to break forth
was well under way before _RARE_ B.C. , and _RARE_ signs go back virtually across the century
, however , is _RARE_
_RARE_ point forward , the main achievements stand as a _RARE_ of the simple patterns of the Dark ages
pottery of the century was Geometric ; ; political organization _RARE_ about the _RARE_ ; ; trade was just beginning to _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ who protected the Greek _RARE_ were only now putting on their sharply _RARE_ dress
student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century
men of the period would have accepted this emphasis
clung to the past the more _RARE_ as they were confronted with _RARE_ new ideas ; ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately _RARE_
is not possible to _RARE_ old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an _RARE_ of the first stage of Greek civilization
principle of division I must _RARE_ the _RARE_ of sculpture , _RARE_ , society , and politics ; ; for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself
contacts between Aegean and _RARE_ are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of _RARE_ culture after _RARE_
not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider _RARE_ Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious _RARE_ of early _RARE_ ; ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ models
of _RARE_ vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past
the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called _RARE_ Geometric
yet _RARE_ vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late _RARE_ century , display as firm a _RARE_ of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; ; but artists now were ready to _RARE_ and elaborate their _RARE_
which resulted had different shapes , far more complex _RARE_ , and a larger sense of style
aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines
centuries men had had enough to do in _RARE_ a fundamental sense of order after _RARE_
had to work on very simple _RARE_ and had not dared to give _RARE_ to _RARE_
, in particular , had virtually _RARE_ _RARE_ drawing , elaborate _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe
vases were _RARE_ the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at first _RARE_ in _RARE_ work , and then more _RARE_ in the initial stages of the Geometric style
social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple plane ; ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments
potters continued to _RARE_ the old _RARE_ of _RARE_ and shapes and made use of the _RARE_ though limited range of _RARE_ which they had inherited
_RARE_ the vases of the early eighth century represent a _RARE_ of earlier lines of progress
_RARE_ _RARE_ , however , new materials were added
less and less of a _RARE_ in a plain dark color ; ; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by _RARE_ patterns into which _RARE_ drawing began to creep
, _RARE_ patterns , _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ nature , birds either _RARE_ or in _RARE_ rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see _RARE_ 11 - 12 ) -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze
of animals and birds , in particular , suggest awareness of _RARE_ animal _RARE_ , _RARE_ perhaps via _RARE_ silver _RARE_ and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are _RARE_ Greek
spread of this type of _RARE_ in the Aegean has not yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the _RARE_ , which were among the leading _RARE_ of pottery throughout the century
material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident
_RARE_ four examples , which are _RARE_ or _RARE_ Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools
discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , _RARE_ him
evidence _RARE_ to get a conviction , he later released him
suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and _RARE_ that he would kill the Indian
later , following his recovery , armed with a _RARE_ issued by the _RARE_ justice on _RARE_ prepared by the district attorney , Cook and _RARE_ rode to arrest _RARE_
_RARE_ , they found _RARE_ in his _RARE_ and demanded that he surrender
he _RARE_ and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported
and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion
Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished
17 , _RARE_ and Cook were sent to the _RARE_ _RARE_ community on the Vermejo to see about _RARE_ out _RARE_ the company had purchased
with _RARE_ M. _RARE_ , Francisco _RARE_ and Juan _RARE_ appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away
nearly _RARE_ before they finished the business with _RARE_ and began riding down the stream
traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a _RARE_ across the stream just ahead of them
ambush , the two _RARE_ decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into _RARE_
two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in _RARE_ , the _RARE_ again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business
with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old _RARE_ Lee ranch
mile below at the mouth of _RARE_ _RARE_ was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A. J. _RARE_ , occupied by a Mexican , his wife , and an old _RARE_
three houses in _RARE_ _RARE_ just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and then passing down in front of the houses , _RARE_ to the Vermejo
west of this road was another low bluff , forty or fifty feet high , covered with _RARE_ oak and other brush
were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two _RARE_ , a _RARE_ of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers
bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit _RARE_ in the leg and another broke his arm , passing on through his body
first reports , Russell's horse _RARE_ to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook , followed by a _RARE_ of bullets , raced towards the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ immediately in front of him , just reaching it as his horse fell
Winchester from its _RARE_ , Cook prepared to fight from behind the _RARE_ bank
so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire
horse in front of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him
very _RARE_ place , two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot
one knee , Cook _RARE_ one , and the other struggled off with his _RARE_ , sending no further fire in his direction
leaving the _RARE_ where he was partially _RARE_ , he did hear shots down at the house
reached the house as Cook _RARE_ , _RARE_ , but just as the old _RARE_ opened the door to receive him , he fell into the _RARE_ arms -- dead
fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head , tearing a hole _RARE_ square on the _RARE_ side
dead , Cook caught Russell's horse and rode to the cattle _RARE_ house to report the incident and request _RARE_ to trail the _RARE_
Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of _RARE_ _RARE_ Frank _RARE_ of _RARE_ followed the trail to the house of Francisco _RARE_ , where 100 to _RARE_ Mexicans had gathered
approached the _RARE_ _RARE_ house and demanded entrance
inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid
demanded the names of the injured men ; ; the Mexicans not only refused to give them , but told the _RARE_ if they wanted a fight they could have it
strength of the Mexicans had been _RARE_ , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search _RARE_ , _RARE_ and his men decided it was much _RARE_ to _RARE_
_RARE_ encouraged the Mexicans to be _RARE_ and _RARE_
following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , _RARE_ , and hay owned by _RARE_ _RARE_ , a friendly _RARE_ for the company , and _RARE_ _RARE_ hay were stolen or destroyed ; ; and a store was broken into and robbed
M. W. Mills warned that he would vigorously _RARE_ persons caught _RARE_ these _RARE_ or carrying arms -- he just didn't catch anyone
on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico
advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by _RARE_ or he would be _RARE_ to kill them in _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_
summer , he wrote from _RARE_ that he was suffering from the wound _RARE_ in the ambush and was in a bad way _RARE_ , so Pels sent him a draft for _RARE_ , warning that it was still not wise for him to return
sent a check for _RARE_ to Russell's widow and had a white marble _RARE_ _RARE_ on his grave
and killing , again serious during the spring of _RARE_ , placed the land grant company officers in a _RARE_ position
reluctant to _RARE_ _RARE_ to protect the property , thus running the risk of creating _RARE_ such as that on the Vermejo , and yet the _RARE_ protested that they got no salary for _RARE_ cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot
law virtually ignored the situation
became ill just as the _RARE_ District Court _RARE_ , no substitute was brought in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of _RARE_ cases _RARE_ were tried , and court _RARE_ _RARE_ die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks
: `` _RARE_ and witnesses were put to the expense and _RARE_ of going long distances to _RARE_ business ; ; public money spent ; ; justice delayed ; ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute _RARE_ ''
the company that the man behind these _RARE_ was Manuel Gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him
by the sheriff for killing an old man named _RARE_ Jones , the _RARE_ for his arrest had never been served
19 , a deputy _RARE_ posse of eight men left _RARE_ City and rode _RARE_ miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan _RARE_ _RARE_
A.M. they reached his house and found it vacant
were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby , they smashed down the door , broke the window , and threw lighted clothes wet with _RARE_ into the room
was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing
yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square
around these buildings , two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside
promised that no harm would _RARE_ him if he would come out , but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door
then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive
refused
earnest , the _RARE_ _RARE_ stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted _RARE_ inside , only to have most _RARE_ out by the women as soon as they hit the floor
became obvious that he could stay inside no longer , taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside , square against the muzzle of a Winchester
the heart , he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away , three bullets following him
pushed open the door he fell on his face , one of his _RARE_ pulling him inside
the _RARE_ of the wound , the _RARE_ warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him
answer , they set the fire
house was about half _RARE_ , his _RARE_ ran to the door and threw up his hands , _RARE_ repeatedly that he did not know the _RARE_ of Manuel
true that he was not inside , the _RARE_ returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket
fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently _RARE_ hand
or eight times the body was _RARE_ with Russell's pistol , belt , and _RARE_
no extra horse so it was left to his _RARE_ who , though _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , had stood around on the _RARE_ nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack
next morning , a Mexican telephoned Pels that _RARE_ _RARE_ , one of the posse members , was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father's home on the upper Vermejo
and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of _RARE_ against men who had been riding about armed , according to signed statements by _RARE_ and Dr. _RARE_ P. George , and ordered _RARE_ Barney Clark of _RARE_ to rescue the _RARE_
night , Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22
heard _RARE_ signals and a number of _RARE_ were _RARE_ on the hills , _RARE_ at the _RARE_ approach
justice of the peace had issue a _RARE_ against _RARE_ for taking part in the `` murder '' of Manuel Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger
helped them gather their _RARE_ and _RARE_ them to _RARE_ along with three other families _RARE_ to leave
or more dangerous parties _RARE_ out for _RARE_ were still at large , and Pels realized that if these men _RARE_ themselves in their _RARE_ houses , defending themselves through _RARE_ , it would be most difficult to _RARE_ them
_RARE_ J. P. _RARE_ and Sons of _RARE_ : `` Have you any _RARE_ hand _RARE_ for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or _RARE_ shot
, how long to order and what is the price ''
decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming _RARE_ , particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard

14 , _RARE_ the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer was _RARE_ an electric light plant for Edward S. _RARE_ at `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service
_RARE_ surveying was done under John _RARE_ on the east mountains to _RARE_ if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant
of it , perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage
step was construction by the Manchester Light and Power Company of a plant on the west bank of the _RARE_ south of Union Street bridge
nearly completed May 23 , _RARE_ with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go on until September 28

have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned _RARE_ of a learned world '' , `` a _RARE_ with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous _RARE_ of intellectual high spirits , a _RARE_ of debate , _RARE_ , comedy and invention ''
to this view , two points are worth making
it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` _RARE_ '' , `` gay ''
the other fact that it is described as `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , `` no less _RARE_ than gay ''
_RARE_ the fact that in a rational _RARE_ , and quite clearly in More's _RARE_ , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn
that a man could be both serious and gay
writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , _RARE_ _RARE_ by all too many _RARE_ who _RARE_ believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that _RARE_ _RARE_ which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of
to find a learned _RARE_ and a _RARE_ joke in More's account of the stupid _RARE_ of early _RARE_ century wars , of the _RARE_ of the poor and _RARE_ , of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the rich and powerful requires a _RARE_ toward suffering and _RARE_ that would be surprising in a moral _RARE_ and most surprising in More himself
it is even surprising in the _RARE_ of Christ Church and _RARE_ Professor of _RARE_ _RARE_ , who _RARE_ this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of _RARE_ and Renaissance English at _RARE_ , who inherited it and is now its most _RARE_ _RARE_
return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr
still widely read because in a sense More stood on the _RARE_ of _RARE_
he did stand on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as _RARE_ _RARE_ might be able to force on Western _RARE_
not even in writing Latin _RARE_ , sometimes _RARE_ ones , or in _RARE_ _RARE_ from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative _RARE_ , or in _RARE_ the conservative _RARE_ who opposed _RARE_ _RARE_ study of the New _RARE_
exercises were the common _RARE_ of a Christian _RARE_ of the first two decades of the _RARE_ century
_RARE_ been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time , whose works _RARE_ survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works
on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia
evidence that he does , indeed , stand there _RARE_ quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual _RARE_ have responded to that book for the past century or so
other contemporary of More's _RARE_ so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work -- _RARE_ _RARE_ and The _RARE_
discover what it is in Utopia that has _RARE_ this response
in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same _RARE_ scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern
was the most important to _RARE_ because he sought to place Thomas More , the author of Utopia , in some _RARE_ relation with St. Thomas More , the martyr
whose concern it is to _RARE_ the significance of Christian _RARE_ , the Renaissance elements are of primary concern
we have a distinctly modern _RARE_ ; ; we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ; we want to know what is _RARE_ new about Utopia
new about it
question the answer is simple ; ; it can be made in two words , Utopian communism
is an answer which opens the door wide to an _RARE_ of objections and _RARE_
is nothing new about communism
it in _RARE_ Republic , and in Utopia More _RARE_ his _RARE_ to that book
it in that `` common way of life _RARE_ to Christ and still in use among the _RARE_ societies of _RARE_ '' , that is , the better _RARE_ which made it easier to _RARE_ the _RARE_ to _RARE_
it in the later _RARE_ conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions
was taken up by the early Church _RARE_ and by _RARE_ lawyers and _RARE_ in the _RARE_ Ages ; ; and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it
the idea of communism is very old even in More's day and did not spring _RARE_ from his imagination in _RARE_ , it is not communism as such that we are concerned with
concerned not with the _RARE_ communism nor with other species of the _RARE_ : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , early Christian , _RARE_ , _RARE_ or _RARE_ communism ; ; we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary _RARE_ of Utopia , as More conceived it
way to _RARE_ our sense of the _RARE_ of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of _RARE_ theory
achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by _RARE_ what it is not
Republic communism is -- to speak _RARE_ -- a communism of _RARE_
is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership _RARE_ , the governing _RARE_ elite
it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ into the construction of an imaginary _RARE_ with its _RARE_ communism of goods , _RARE_ , and children , was his quest for a _RARE_ for the proper ordering of the individual human _RARE_ ; ; and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns
Utopia communism is not a means of _RARE_ out a _RARE_ elite from the _RARE_ mass
applies to all _RARE_
the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central
of Utopia is with the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the best ordering of a civil society ; ; and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to that best ordering
Utopian communism from the _RARE_ Christian community of the _RARE_ age or from its medieval _RARE_ , the _RARE_ communities , is with an appropriate shift of _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the same way as to derive it from _RARE_ Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual _RARE_ , in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ communities with an elite of spiritual and religious _RARE_
community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself
_RARE_ communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a _RARE_ which would test their religious _RARE_ for _RARE_ _RARE_ , their spiritual _RARE_
the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the _RARE_ was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time , although it was not accepted by all the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Ages
tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of _RARE_ before the _RARE_ of Man
not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of _RARE_ was not a possible alternative once man had _RARE_
function of _RARE_ communism was adequately set forth by St. _RARE_ almost a _RARE_ before More wrote Utopia
soil is common to all men
give the _RARE_ of life to the poor , we _RARE_ to them what is already theirs
think of it more as an act of justice than _RARE_ ''
not _RARE_ of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely _RARE_ right to what is his
of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience _RARE_ to regard himself as a _RARE_
a trustee for the common good , however _RARE_ the _RARE_ which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his _RARE_ of that share of the common fund , _RARE_ or _RARE_ , _RARE_ to his keeping
to this _RARE_ view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the _RARE_ of municipal law is to _RARE_ on the _RARE_ sea of human _RARE_ in a _RARE_
brace conscience with legal sanctions
properly ordered society the massive force of public law _RARE_ the function which in natural law theory _RARE_ is left altogether to a small voice so often still
the _RARE_ just indicated Utopian communism _RARE_ from previous _RARE_ in which community of possessions and living plays a role
one of these _RARE_ nor from a combination of them can it be _RARE_
not deny _RARE_ to the _RARE_ because _RARE_ found the _RARE_ of the house of _RARE_ among the folk _RARE_ of the _RARE_
like sense whatever _RARE_ or _RARE_ of previous _RARE_ one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing
not merely a new thing ; ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; ; most of the rest is medieval or _RARE_ or part of an old tradition of social criticism
say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin _RARE_ _RARE_ a new perception of the nature of the _RARE_ encounter with man
indeed , is _RARE_ perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make _RARE_ to modern students what _RARE_ was getting at
communism is both new in _RARE_ and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern _RARE_ , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice
features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the _RARE_ ; ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including _RARE_ , meals taken publicly in common _RARE_ ; ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; ; even houses changed once a decade ; ; six hours of _RARE_ labor a day for all but a _RARE_ of _RARE_ and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from _RARE_ ; ; no private property , no money ; ; no sort of _RARE_ at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term
_RARE_ of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern _RARE_ or _RARE_
not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that _RARE_ those details
spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the _RARE_ tradition with the _RARE_ continuous history , the one which reached _RARE_ by the way of _RARE_ through the Church _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ trial the _RARE_ press condemned the proceedings and _RARE_ _RARE_ as a martyr to the principles of the _RARE_ of Independence
Brown trial , however , the _RARE_ most powerful _RARE_ newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his _RARE_ , with the assistance of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , had plotted not only the _RARE_ of the slaves but also the _RARE_ of state and federal governments
Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the _RARE_ of John Brown was characteristic of _RARE_ acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican _RARE_ , who proclaim as one of their _RARE_ principles that they do not _RARE_ with slavery in the states ''
major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of _RARE_ the facts and attempting to _RARE_ history
Daily Post continued to accuse _RARE_ and the Daily Journal continued to accuse _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ complained that the Virginia authorities showed _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ Brown and his men
stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial ''
Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the _RARE_ in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be _RARE_ feelings
Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must _RARE_ him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace
31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of _RARE_ against the state of Virginia , _RARE_ slave _RARE_ , and murder
_RARE_ he was _RARE_ to be _RARE_ in public on Friday , December 2 , 1859
the news , _RARE_ writers , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia
_RARE_ were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown's trial with extreme interest
morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown _RARE_ deserved the extreme _RARE_ , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the _RARE_ without a fair trial
main criticism of the trial was the _RARE_ with which it was conducted
of the Providence Daily Post , however , learned that it was generally _RARE_ that `` Old Brown '' had a fair trial
sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have _RARE_ her laws , organized _RARE_ , and _RARE_ her citizens ''
eastern section of the state the _RARE_ reaction to Brown's trial and sentence were basically identical
Smith , editor of the Warren Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in order that all those _RARE_ _RARE_ , who , _RARE_ by a blind _RARE_ , dare to _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and murder , may _RARE_ it and shape their future course _RARE_ ''
of the Newport _RARE_ could discover no evidence of _RARE_ circumstances in the Brown trial which would _RARE_ making an exception to the _RARE_ of capital punishment
contrast to the other Rhode Island _RARE_ , Samuel S. _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ condemned the trial as being completely unfair
sentence , _RARE_ wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall _RARE_ _RARE_ and that John Brown's sentence shall be _RARE_ to _RARE_ , it would be well -- well for the country and for Virginia ''
excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown , Rhode _RARE_ turned their attention to the state elections
had elected Republican candidates in the past two years
no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state
failed on occasion to _RARE_ its candidates for general state offices by _RARE_ , the failure was due to a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ party , which called itself the American Republican party
_RARE_ and the _RARE_ both _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ for governor
_RARE_ was the _RARE_ _RARE_
of the election of 1859 found Republican candidates not only _RARE_ the offices of governor and _RARE_ but also obtaining the two _RARE_ offices from the eastern and western sections of the state
month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers
7 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal _RARE_ a letter sent to John Brown from `` E. B. '' , a _RARE_ lady in Newport
to Brown's _RARE_ she wrote , `` though we are _RARE_ and _RARE_ believe it better to _RARE_ by moral and not by _RARE_ weapons , we know _RARE_ was _RARE_ by the most generous and _RARE_ motives ''
B. '' compared John Brown to _RARE_ in that they were both acting to deliver millions from _RARE_
to `` E. B. '' , most Rhode _RARE_ hardly thought of John Brown as being another _RARE_
to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an _RARE_ audience in Rhode Island
evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , _RARE_ Mark _RARE_ of New _RARE_ , gave a `` _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the _RARE_ Ferry _RARE_
Telegraph stated that many of _RARE_ _RARE_ remarks were _RARE_ and _RARE_ strongly of _RARE_ and _RARE_
account of the _RARE_ lecture , the Providence Daily Post said that the remarks of _RARE_ _RARE_ made the people _RARE_
or _RARE_ for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more _RARE_ of sympathy
Daily Journal , however , stated that Brown's courage , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one ''
_RARE_ admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or _RARE_ `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. _RARE_ or James _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ more concern over the possibility of the _RARE_ making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him
letter to John Brown , `` E. B. '' , the _RARE_ from Newport , had suggested that the American people _RARE_ more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington
latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution , it seems that most Rhode _RARE_ did not _RARE_ in `` E. _RARE_ '' suggestion
22 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown's `` _RARE_ '' and honest _RARE_ must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only _RARE_ other _RARE_ to _RARE_ his actions
later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting _RARE_ John Brown on the day of his execution
of the Daily Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or _RARE_ from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence ''
Daily _RARE_ editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting _RARE_ Brown was to be held in Providence
called upon the people of Providence to _RARE_ the meeting and avoid _RARE_
2 , 1859 , John Brown was _RARE_ at Charles _RARE_ , Virginia
were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the _RARE_ surrounding the _RARE_
_RARE_ towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were _RARE_
not the case in Rhode Island
public demonstration in honor of John Brown was held at _RARE_ Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution
opposition of the city newspapers , the _RARE_ Hall meeting `` brought together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the _RARE_ of such a gathering ''
the platform were _RARE_ C. _RARE_ , _RARE_ of Providence and a _RARE_ Republican stove manufacturer ; ; Thomas Davis , an _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; the Reverend _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ minister ; ; the Reverend George _RARE_ Day , a _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ W. _RARE_ , and William H. H. _RARE_
two were appointed _RARE_
speaker was _RARE_ C. _RARE_ who had been _RARE_ chosen president of the meeting
of his desire to promote the _RARE_ of slavery by _RARE_ means and he compared John Brown of _RARE_ Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode _RARE_ _RARE_ period
that as Rhode _RARE_ John Brown became a _RARE_ hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John Brown of _RARE_ Ferry
speaker was George _RARE_ Day
Brown's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; ; his _RARE_ was not below , but above the law ''
was _RARE_ who spoke of his _RARE_ of Brown's attempt at _RARE_ _RARE_ , his _RARE_ of Brown's character , and his opposition to slavery
were _RARE_ by a portion of the audience several times and once there was _RARE_
and last speaker was Thomas Davis
time large numbers of the audience had left the hall
his remarks by an _RARE_ to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city
that the _RARE_ or _RARE_ of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the _RARE_ of private judgments
remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his _RARE_ for Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they `` are _RARE_ to the charge that they are supporting _RARE_ and _RARE_ men whom the laws have condemned ''
that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of a man ( Thomas W. _RARE_ ) proclaimed the _RARE_ action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty
close of _RARE_ speech the following _RARE_ and _RARE_ were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed _RARE_ : Whereas , John Brown has _RARE_ _RARE_ his life in _RARE_ to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day _RARE_ to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no _RARE_ : Therefore , _RARE_ that , while we most _RARE_ _RARE_ the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his _RARE_ to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor
his _RARE_ and _RARE_ in _RARE_ , _RARE_ by the violence and _RARE_ of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call for a _RARE_ judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to _RARE_ the _RARE_ from which he had suffered , and _RARE_ his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and _RARE_ justice
the _RARE_ sentiment is becoming _RARE_ for _RARE_ action
that we find in this _RARE_ _RARE_ at _RARE_ Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as _RARE_ as possible
morning following the _RARE_ Hall meeting the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that although the meeting was _RARE_ and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely
being _RARE_ , the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture
and 1912 , as the _RARE_ _RARE_ tendency to _RARE_ to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at _RARE_ length fell all the more to _RARE_ _RARE_
, and sometimes to replace , the simulated _RARE_ , Braque and Picasso began to _RARE_ sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas
other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact _RARE_ of wood _RARE_ or _RARE_
, by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be _RARE_ -- and set to _RARE_ again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms _RARE_ within the illusion that these forms left no room for the _RARE_ except near the surface
of such devices , however , soon had the effect of _RARE_ , even while _RARE_ , surface and depth
of _RARE_ seemed _RARE_ , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from _RARE_ with the illusion
for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and _RARE_ step of _RARE_ actual pieces of _RARE_ wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to _RARE_ its _RARE_ in paint
that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of _RARE_ , when he glued a piece of _RARE_ _RARE_ to a painting on canvas
true that his first collage looks more _RARE_ than _RARE_ , which would confirm the date he _RARE_ it
is also true that Braque was the consistent _RARE_ in the use of simulated _RARE_ as well as of _RARE_ ; ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Cubism as far back as the end of 1910
examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each
makes no real difference that _RARE_ collage is on paper and _RARE_ out in charcoal , while _RARE_ is on canvas and _RARE_ out in oil
its greater _RARE_ presence and its greater _RARE_ , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated _RARE_ had ever done
again , the _RARE_ device both _RARE_ and falls short of its aim
illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in _RARE_ , which gives way in turn , and with equal _RARE_ , to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither
the size of the areas it covers , the _RARE_ paper _RARE_ _RARE_ flatness _RARE_ , as more than an indication or sign
now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device _RARE_ : the illusion of depth is rendered even more _RARE_ than before
_RARE_ the literal flatness by _RARE_ and _RARE_ it , the _RARE_ paper or cloth _RARE_ and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this _RARE_ flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture
surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns out -- suddenly and _RARE_ -- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of , upon , the surface
very first _RARE_ , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as _RARE_ seem to thrust out into real , _RARE_ space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains _RARE_ in , or flat upon , the surface
surface is driven back , in its very _RARE_ , only by this contrast
upper center of _RARE_ first collage , _RARE_ _RARE_ ( in _RARE_ _RARE_ collection ) , a bunch of _RARE_ is rendered with such _RARE_ vivid _RARE_ effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane
illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel _RARE_ , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it
violent _RARE_ of the wallpaper strips _RARE_ to the paper , and the only _RARE_ _RARE_ of block _RARE_ that _RARE_ window _RARE_ , manage somehow to push the _RARE_ cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump ''
same time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of _RARE_ _RARE_ upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block _RARE_ ; ; and these _RARE_ seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing , and by contrast with the _RARE_ of the _RARE_
part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane ; ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the _RARE_ and ambiguous one that each has with the surface
same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of _RARE_ first collage
_RARE_ of both _RARE_ , a variety of _RARE_ materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other _RARE_ and _RARE_ device they can think of
adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a _RARE_ form -- will be _RARE_ to _RARE_ that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even _RARE_ over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth
as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested _RARE_ which is greater than that established _RARE_
_RARE_ the _RARE_ between surface and depth so as to _RARE_ _RARE_ space in front of the surface as well as behind it
now _RARE_ everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a _RARE_ illusion
_RARE_ flatness is now almost completely _RARE_ to the literal , _RARE_ kind , but at the same time it _RARE_ upon and largely _RARE_ the _RARE_ kind -- and it does so , moreover , without _RARE_ the latter of its _RARE_ ; ; rather , it _RARE_ and _RARE_ that _RARE_ , _RARE_ it
this _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ subject _RARE_
had turned out , by a further _RARE_ of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and _RARE_ had now become widely _RARE_ from the means of representation or _RARE_
_RARE_ phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize _RARE_ simply in order to preserve it ; ; they had also had to _RARE_ it -- to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became _RARE_ from specific three-dimensional _RARE_ and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ property _RARE_ from everything not itself
to be saved , _RARE_ had had to be isolated ; ; and as the aspect of the subject was _RARE_ into those _RARE_ of more or less _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ by which _RARE_ was isolated under the _RARE_ method , the subject itself became largely _RARE_
in its _RARE_ phase ( which the French , with justice , call `` _RARE_ '' ) was on the _RARE_ of abstract art
then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation
_RARE_ for illusion , it could only be illusion per _RARE_ -- an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and _RARE_ as to _RARE_ the representation of individual objects
on the other hand , they _RARE_ for representation , it had to be representation per _RARE_ -- representation as image pure and simple , without _RARE_ ( at least , without more than _RARE_ ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented _RARE_ existed
the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear : the _RARE_ could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive _RARE_
end , Picasso and Braque _RARE_ for the _RARE_ , and it would seem they did so deliberately
provides whatever real _RARE_ there is for the talk about `` reality ''
the inner , formal logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with _RARE_ their decision
smaller _RARE_ of _RARE_ Cubism were placed upon or _RARE_ with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to _RARE_ -- become `` _RARE_ '' -- into larger _RARE_ shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the _RARE_ of the picture plane
their previous _RARE_ _RARE_ , they would have cut away too abruptly into depth ; ; and the broad , _RARE_ shapes of _RARE_ paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane
_RARE_ with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as _RARE_ ; ; and independent _RARE_ are _RARE_ to coincide with the _RARE_ contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject )
because of this _RARE_ as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the _RARE_ unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of _RARE_ objects , or at least parts of them , _RARE_ in _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and continued to remain more _RARE_ there -- but only as _RARE_ _RARE_ -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of _RARE_
came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; ; nor did _RARE_ Cubism fully begin there
the collage had been _RARE_ translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , _RARE_ _RARE_ whose _RARE_ and placement created _RARE_ to , if not the illusion of , _RARE_ three-dimensional _RARE_
began with Picasso alone , late in _RARE_ or early in _RARE_ ; ; this was the point at which he finally took the lead in _RARE_ _RARE_ away from Braque , never again to _RARE_ it
before that , Picasso had _RARE_ and entered , for a moment , a certain _RARE_ path in which no one had preceded him
as though , in that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too _RARE_ and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal _RARE_
did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in general ) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane
in 1912 , Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a _RARE_ ; ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut _RARE_ , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and _RARE_ space to which there clung only the _RARE_ of a picture plane
elements of collage were _RARE_ , as it were , and cut off from the literal _RARE_ surface to form a _RARE_
in 1957 finally _RARE_ to the _RARE_
without high density in the core , _RARE_ systems cannot be maintained _RARE_ , let alone built from scratch at today's prices
the building of _RARE_ and _RARE_ cannot continue forever
_RARE_ among the four Los Angeles _RARE_ , including the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ by itself no less than _RARE_ acres of downtown land , _RARE_ of a square mile , an area about the size of _RARE_ Center in New York
hard to believe that this mass of _RARE_ concrete _RARE_ what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of _RARE_ located urban land
affects the city's fiscal situation , such an _RARE_ is _RARE_ ; ; it _RARE_ forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services
land values without taking away land ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ less ( because the _RARE_ they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the _RARE_ that can be taxed
Angeles is already _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , street , parking lot and garage -- one of those _RARE_ `` if '' statistics has already come to pass
with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , _RARE_ boundary
do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might
_RARE_ plans may be more successful -- especially when the _RARE_ and _RARE_ are raised , allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the _RARE_
the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance
greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial _RARE_ '' removed from the city's political jurisdiction
of the _RARE_ is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor
industry , the _RARE_ of being on one floor are much _RARE_ , but efficiency engineers usually believe in them , and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers
of industry away from the central cities is not so _RARE_ new as some _RARE_ seem to believe
merely the latest example of the _RARE_ growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities
factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities -- the rubber factories in _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ plants , U.S. _RARE_ _RARE_ works -- often began on these _RARE_ at a time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( _RARE_ ) and power ( river )
_RARE_ '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam _RARE_ , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet _RARE_
and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site
_RARE_ became cheap , he had to be near a railroad _RARE_ and a _RARE_ line or an existing large community of lower-class homes
_RARE_ is still important -- it is usually , though not always , true that _RARE_ _RARE_ by rail is _RARE_ than _RARE_
who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad
are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and _RARE_ bus lines , is actually more convenient than the _RARE_ factory
, General _RARE_ enormous installations at _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , _RARE_ in _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ in Los Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere -- none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit
all suburban plants , _RARE_ on the roads to keep them supplied with workers
the new _RARE_ go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry
along _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston , may be a vision of the future
could be worse
along _RARE_ _RARE_ are mostly well designed and _RARE_ set against the New England rocks and trees
even be rather grand , like Edward _RARE_ _RARE_ to the _RARE_ success of _RARE_
deny the values of the city -- the crowded , competitive , _RARE_ city , the `` melting pot '' which gave off so many of the most _RARE_ American qualities
segregated businesses , _RARE_ again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities
interesting to note how many of the plants on _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ draw most of their income either from the government in _RARE_ _RARE_ arrangements , or from the _RARE_ of _RARE_ which grant at least a _RARE_ _RARE_
factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the city's _RARE_
the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities
loss of hotel business to the _RARE_ motel has been relatively _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ is becoming harder to find every year
most is the damage the automobile has done to _RARE_ _RARE_ , especially in those cities where public transit is _RARE_
, of course , always spreads with the population -- _RARE_ stores , _RARE_ , local _RARE_ and dress shops , _RARE_ stores and the like
a major purchase was _RARE_ forty years ago -- a new bedroom set or a winter coat , an _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ for _RARE_ -- the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest
_RARE_ in the `` one hundred per cent location '' , where all the transit lines _RARE_
are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' _RARE_ more and more dry goods
_RARE_ and _RARE_ downtown unit sales have been _RARE_ , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank
discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially _RARE_
_RARE_ branch -- not even _RARE_ vast _RARE_ outside _RARE_ -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of _RARE_ to be found in the home store
_RARE_ the picture : the _RARE_ naturally calls a local rather than a _RARE_ number if both are listed in an _RARE_ , especially if the local call _RARE_ city sales tax
branch is thereby _RARE_ with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened
which continue to charge a _RARE_ overhead and _RARE_ expense to the main store make the branches seem more _RARE_ than they are
cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were _RARE_ on terms less _RARE_ to the old store
the competition -- always a great _RARE_ force in the American economy -- makes _RARE_ who do not have suburban operations _RARE_ both the volume and the _RARE_ of their _RARE_ _RARE_ new branches
seems to be that very many large branch stores are _RARE_ , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly _RARE_ cities will support only so many big branches
the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative _RARE_ who act as _RARE_ for retail giants are beginning to discover
has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American _RARE_
the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store , though both are the same distance from home
there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are _RARE_ much nearer to downtown
reports that _RARE_ of East St. Louis have been driving across the _RARE_ , through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town
extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ , Ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door
distant _RARE_ of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the _RARE_ to do something about the _RARE_ or _RARE_ the completion of the federal highway program
the affection for the suburban branch _RARE_ a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the _RARE_ urban mass which supports the downtown department store , the central location may be in serious trouble
according to land _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some _RARE_ acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the _RARE_ Central _RARE_ _RARE_ put together
store continues to offer the great _RARE_ of variety , both within its _RARE_ and across the street , where other department stores are immediately convenient for the _RARE_ who wants to see what is available before making up her mind
may be predicted in the _RARE_ world of _RARE_ , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to _RARE_ _RARE_ clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too much of a production ) , household _RARE_ and the discount business in _RARE_ items
were built on dry goods , especially _RARE_ _RARE_ , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown
analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn out to be what _RARE_ cost _RARE_ refuse to _RARE_ , marginal operations rather than major factors
America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered
_RARE_ gonna keep 'em down on the farm ''
question that had to be asked long before they saw _RARE_
usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and _RARE_ of downtown
radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this _RARE_ -- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , _RARE_ foreseen by so many urban _RARE_ , is actually upon us

Negroes In their book , American _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and Henry Hope _RARE_ argue that _RARE_ _RARE_ New _RARE_ was what made the modern _RARE_ a possibility -- a fine _RARE_ argument , when you consider how _RARE_ tend to vote
_RARE_ -- New _RARE_ Henry Hudson and _RARE_ Lake _RARE_ , San _RARE_ Bay Bridge and its approaches , a good _RARE_ of the Pennsylvania _RARE_ -- were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression
same time , _RARE_ Federal _RARE_ Administration , coupled with Henry _RARE_ _RARE_ policy , permitted ordinary _RARE_ families to build their own homes
had been reluctant to _RARE_ without better security than the house itself got that security from the U. S. government ; ; _RARE_ who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term _RARE_ _RARE_ found they could _RARE_ for twenty-five years at 4 per cent , under government _RARE_
itself in the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance _RARE_ _RARE_ made a last appearance in the Brumidi _RARE_ of the Capitol _RARE_ in Washington
generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more _RARE_ standard of execution , and tended to _RARE_ _RARE_ of conception where _RARE_ and weakness were easy to find
is a great conception
ceiling , with _RARE_ and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of _RARE_ and his _RARE_ followers
may be remote , but this is surely the only _RARE_ example of that vigorous _RARE_ in the United States
designed the _RARE_ scheme as a whole , in _RARE_ with the _RARE_ Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden _RARE_ of _RARE_ with the present much larger iron structure
years and many _RARE_ he was able to finish the _RARE_ fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the _RARE_ group opposite the East door , and ending with William _RARE_ , all but one leg , when a _RARE_ accident ended his career
at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle
carried out not too _RARE_ by _RARE_ Costaggini , who began by supplying the missing member to the _RARE_ of Pennsylvania and _RARE_ in pencil , in Italian , that he `` began at this point ''
had used up all the sketches _RARE_ feet of empty frieze were left over
_RARE_ void , _RARE_ in _RARE_ , _RARE_ the wall of the _RARE_ until 1951
advised by the _RARE_ of the Capitol , the _RARE_ Committee for the _RARE_ , _RARE_ responsible for the works of art in the building , ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco , to show `` the Peace after the Civil War '' , `` the _RARE_ War '' , and `` the _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' , to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique and composition
cleaning and _RARE_ were ordered , first of the older part of the frieze , finally of the _RARE_
is therefore a description of three separate _RARE_ , the new _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ , with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each
use of students and future _RARE_ , a full , _RARE_ record was kept of all three _RARE_ , complete technical reports on what we found and what we did
be consulted in the office of the _RARE_ of the Capitol , or the _RARE_ of Congress
preliminary was _RARE_ the _RARE_ length of frieze , a _RARE_ of _RARE_ and finish coats , all in bad condition
decided to strip the whole area down to the _RARE_ , and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older _RARE_ preparation , with a mortar , one part _RARE_ lime , three parts sand , to be put on in two layers
drawn full size , after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities
some difficulty here
to manage the given subjects , three _RARE_ recent events , so as to make them part of a classical frieze , -- that is , a pattern of large figures filling the space , with not much else , against a blank background
all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his
was all arranged to fit , and not to _RARE_ the _RARE_ flow of movement in the frieze , the _RARE_ were tried in place
, a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the _RARE_ above , was strong and safe , but _RARE_ _RARE_
be seen from the floor , but by moving around the _RARE_ one could get _RARE_ ; ; and we were able to decide on some _RARE_ of scale
sure of matching color as well as form , pieces of _RARE_ were _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , and large samples painted in fresco , then left two months to dry out to their final key
was _RARE_ to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came
was the length of the space to be painted
of Brumidi and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order , though the _RARE_ _RARE_ surface was thick with dust
they came out surprisingly clear and bright
be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster , one half inch , and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described by _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and current in Italy to this day
, they used _RARE_ color throughout , getting solid _RARE_ with active lime white
a _RARE_ '' is much in evidence
_RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ shadows , and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat
is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint
own practice , to have the last `` _RARE_ '' plaster coat thick enough to match , and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying , we found that it had to be put on in two layers , letting the first set _RARE_ before applying the second
was three parts sand to two of lime
the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was _RARE_ several months for us ; ; but to make it _RARE_ , of a really _RARE_ consistency to avoid cracking , we added a little _RARE_ lime -- hard on the hands , but we could see no other _RARE_
told that a mortar longer _RARE_ might have remained longer in condition for painting
was , it took the _RARE_ well for six hours , enough for our purpose , and held it firmly in setting
obvious that to match Brumidi , white must be mixed with all but the _RARE_ tones
, hard and brilliant , has a tendency to `` jump '' away from the other colors in drying , and also by its capacity to set , to _RARE_ the use of _RARE_ _RARE_ , so useful in _RARE_ work
Italian practice , lime , dried and _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , entered into such prepared shades
we chose a stronger _RARE_ , unknown to the early _RARE_ or to Brumidi , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the active lime white for highest lights , put on at the end of the day's _RARE_
were mostly raw _RARE_ , some _RARE_ _RARE_ , and a little yellow _RARE_
was probably not in Brumidi's _RARE_ , but was needed to take the chill , _RARE_ look off the new work next to the old , where _RARE_ effects of time were seen , even after thorough cleaning
of `` _RARE_ '' we tried to restrict to covering _RARE_
, however , that it is very difficult to paint a dark _RARE_ background in fresco that will not dry out _RARE_ and _RARE_
and Costaggini will be seen _RARE_ with this same problem
forced , as they were , to work a good deal of _RARE_ into background and dark areas
it by _RARE_ _RARE_ , five parts thoroughly washed cheese _RARE_ to one of lime _RARE_ ; ; ground together they made a strong _RARE_ , which became _RARE_ in drying
was taken in 1953
part is finished
right is the Brumidi _RARE_ group , as it looked after cleaning operations , which had not yet come around to the other end ; ; where , of Costaggini , only some _RARE_ has been washed , at the point where his work stopped
led to speculate as to why the empty space was there , left for our century to finish
it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle
later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and _RARE_ his father's _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ a bit he could claim for his very own
might be settled by _RARE_ the measurement of the actual _RARE_ with the dimensions noted , presumably in Brumidi's hand , above the various sections of his long _RARE_ drawing , which has been kept
, it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` _RARE_ '' and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California gold
a fresco , the handling of wet mortar _RARE_ one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right , not to _RARE_ _RARE_ work with today's _RARE_
very first , then , Brumidi was required , by the _RARE_ _RARE_ shape of his central group , to fill in the _RARE_ space above the seated girl on _RARE_ right , before starting on the _RARE_ figures themselves
put a small man , whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful , until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning , this was to be the closing figure of the party of `` _RARE_ '' , and was to hold a basket
_RARE_ rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away
, Figure 1 of the completed frieze , shows how , having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for _RARE_ years , he has now been given a hand , and by _RARE_ ( and the permission of the Committee ) , given a new job , to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in _RARE_
bright effect of the first _RARE_ led the Committee to order the rest of the _RARE_ cycle cleaned and restored to go with them
wooden _RARE_ was removed , and , so as to reach all the frieze , one of pipe , on wheels , built up from the floor
days , in the early morning , as the work progressed , twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the _RARE_ pavement , supported as it is by ancient brick _RARE_
_RARE_ and _RARE_ platform over fifty feet from the floor , after a first _RARE_ , we began to wash
useful tool for _RARE_ the surface without running down was made from a _RARE_ `` mist spray '' _RARE_ _RARE_ to a hose connection , to be used at low water pressure
in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower
_RARE_ , with a _RARE_ in hand to check excess _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ with two _RARE_
a repeated _RARE_ was needed , but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to _RARE_ the original brightness
or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in _RARE_ chemical reactions
`` a fresco '' stood up _RARE_ ; ; a little of the `` _RARE_ '' came off
was put on at once
found the _RARE_ first rate , especially Brumidi's
greatly helped by there being no _RARE_ of former _RARE_
more than _RARE_ had ever been done , and not much of that
was sound , the _RARE_ firmly attached all over , and the _RARE_ solidly incorporated with it in all but a few _RARE_ places
source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly _RARE_ from _RARE_ above , soaking the surface and leaving _RARE_ of dissolved lime , very _RARE_ even after cleaning , particularly in the `` _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ and the _RARE_ '' , and `` _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ , referring to the use of the Capitol as a public building , not a _RARE_ , _RARE_ some _RARE_ to maintain _RARE_ effect , rather than leaving blank , _RARE_ patches
have had no care for _RARE_ years
gas _RARE_ below and _RARE_ windows above , enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium , they have survived , in a building long _RARE_ in winter , hot and damp under the iron _RARE_ in summer
I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me
well be that , when _RARE_ _RARE_ and I visited your country last spring , you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked
artists , it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible
might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful
we did not see many of your faces , it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard , from those whom we had the fortune to encounter , that we had been in your midst
very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the _RARE_
well understand your curiosity
ourselves , are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live
my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet _RARE_
be no reason to _RARE_ or ignore the intent of this letter
I _RARE_ earnestly to record our impressions without the _RARE_ that the anxiety of our time so easily _RARE_
of little more than a month cannot _RARE_ me to _RARE_ as an expert on anything I saw
damage is done by `` experts '' who have spent even less time , if any at all , in the _RARE_
consider it reasonable , because of my _RARE_ as an artist , to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to _RARE_ as a whole rather than to specific _RARE_ interests
attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union , it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view
a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own _RARE_ are too _RARE_ to _RARE_ any symbolic significance to the _RARE_ of a minority , such as artists , in any social order
many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience
I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to _RARE_ a curiously _RARE_ reaction
if I were talking about something quite _RARE_
is not the time and the climate in which people will listen _RARE_ , or at least _RARE_ , to individual impressions of a subject which _RARE_ a good deal of their waking moments
tend to _RARE_ the ear and , in turn , the voice as well
be content with the _RARE_ small talk of a somewhat unusual _RARE_
equally impatient with the _RARE_ of the shoulder , shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long ; ; the aggressive _RARE_ of those who are _RARE_ lost in a semantic jungle of the word `` _RARE_ '' ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ by the sick _RARE_ of ignorance who try to build a _RARE_ wall of _RARE_ on our physical _RARE_
it may have been at times , _RARE_ and I saw enough , talked to enough artists , _RARE_ and others to realize that the issue is quite clear
poets are the raw _RARE_ of _RARE_ ; ; they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately _RARE_ in everyday life
they may not be able to save the life on this planet , but without them there would be very little left worth saving
be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one
cold , but bright , April day we were guests of your government in the _RARE_ stand of Red Square to witness the _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ _RARE_ and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive _RARE_ of the _RARE_
thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people _RARE_ a new hero and a great national achievement , our last day , to us at least , was equally impressive and very moving , even though the _RARE_ were absent and there was almost complete silence
under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of _RARE_ looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian poet and writer who _RARE_ the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor
, about _RARE_ between his home and the blue _RARE_ of a small church , rose above the forms and spaces of gently _RARE_ _RARE_ of green , the sounds of birds , the silence of other _RARE_ and the casual _RARE_ through small _RARE_
we had met and talked with a living writer , a contemporary of the dead poet , who is known for his ability of _RARE_ his ideas and his craft more _RARE_
we were aware of only two men
taken a flight into _RARE_ space , in the service of science , to return as a living hero
had assumed the right to explore the equally _RARE_ space of the human spirit
on his grave _RARE_ to the fact that he as well was _RARE_ hero
_RARE_ form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which , to me at least , _RARE_ the _RARE_ in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between _RARE_ and _RARE_
that is being _RARE_ all over the world in the _RARE_ of _RARE_
opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was _RARE_ even further with an incredible semantic _RARE_
environment , it was stated , had _RARE_ these two extreme _RARE_ and was about to produce a new plant and fruit
_RARE_ on one such occasion that the new growth , like other _RARE_ , might be unable to _RARE_ , I was immediately accused of preaching _RARE_ _RARE_
not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to
while we were perhaps less surprised , but still puzzled , when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
remark about _RARE_ sealed train brought the _RARE_ that this was a myth _RARE_ to George _RARE_ _RARE_ tree
the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific _RARE_ concerning the _RARE_ of _RARE_ masses
that _RARE_ and I had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence , namely , _RARE_ _RARE_
such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union of Soviet _RARE_
looked forward to what we hoped to be our first _RARE_ meeting with a number of _RARE_ artists
we became involved in a series of friendly , but _RARE_ formal , _RARE_ addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind
of friendship , understanding , cooperation , etc. , tend to become somewhat _RARE_ because of constant and _RARE_ use
only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion
female _RARE_ , of massive proportions and _RARE_ appearance , initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of _RARE_ gentlemen representing the arts
only after we had responded , with what I fear were similar _RARE_ , that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and _RARE_ actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and _RARE_
by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there
returned later , just as I had taken advantage of the _RARE_ atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Program would be the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Art in Russia , with Social _RARE_ _RARE_ dominance in the U.S.
her an opportunity to ring down the _RARE_ with the _RARE_ _RARE_ that we should not _RARE_ to lecture her on _RARE_
not go so far as to say , as was done on other occasions , that _RARE_ as well as _RARE_ were a Russian invention that had been _RARE_ as _RARE_ by the people of the _RARE_
I could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in _RARE_ than elsewhere
to discover , in fact , that quite a number of people share with us the impression that , in contrast to other Soviet regions , _RARE_ atmosphere is _RARE_ _RARE_ and official
one's intentions deliberately or _RARE_ _RARE_ is always a waste of time
_RARE_ experience , I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or _RARE_
do not talk to each other in that fashion ; ; and , _RARE_ , I could not _RARE_ the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group
time , some _RARE_ seemed necessary
is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in _RARE_ : `` We have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and _RARE_ your ideas and your ways
here should also be considered further , sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer , peaceful _RARE_ among all people
quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the _RARE_ contacts and _RARE_ of ideas between individuals
of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you , we have already seen many _RARE_ of your character and spirit
_RARE_ aware that yours is a society which , in spite of several wars and many _RARE_ , has developed itself into one of the _RARE_ nations of the world
history is _RARE_ with the _RARE_ of the _RARE_
history is equally _RARE_ for its industrial and scientific achievements
come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to _RARE_ you with that of ours
, as American artists , believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity , we would be less than honest with you , or ourselves , if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole
this position , we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and _RARE_ in other lands to share our opinion in every respect
matter of fact , we _RARE_ the diversity among our own people so much that we will not _RARE_ to speak for all other American artists
, all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for _RARE_ between you and us , but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of _RARE_
, we have pride and love for our country
of us , this is a land to which we or our parents fled from _RARE_ terror in order to live in _RARE_ freedom
we feel the same _RARE_ , as do other individuals , in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation
Society is an ambitious work
is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society
so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily `` fail ''
_RARE_ reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important _RARE_ , areas of ignorance and _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ , examples of broad positions supported by _RARE_ evidence , and the like
are easy _RARE_ for critics
the _RARE_ be _RARE_
and orderly man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book
a simple matter , for one so _RARE_ , to take a work like The _RARE_ Society and _RARE_ it into odds and ends
can be made to look like the _RARE_ attic of a large and vigorous family -- a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ objects , some _RARE_ and some that were never useful , some once whole and bright but now _RARE_ and _RARE_ , some odd pieces whose history no one _RARE_ , here and there a _RARE_ , everything _RARE_ because it suggests some part of the human condition -- the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the _RARE_ history of the _RARE_ and users
be easily done , but there is little reason in it
come down to saying that Fromm _RARE_ with a broad brush , and that , after all , is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the _RARE_
these features of the book because they are inherent in the _RARE_ character and therefore must be mentioned
be _RARE_ to build a _RARE_ around them
more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of _RARE_ civilization
_RARE_ to recall that Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and _RARE_ aspects
have already discussed his moral position , that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages , which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment
first indicate a couple of _RARE_ in Fromm's analysis , then argue that , granted these _RARE_ , he still has much left that is valuable , and , finally , raise the general question of a philosophical versus a _RARE_ approach to the question of alienation
empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation
rather long intellectual history , alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a _RARE_ theory
has received much attention in philosophy , in literature , and in a few works of general social criticism , such as The _RARE_ Society
missing is work that would answer , presumably by the use of survey methods and _RARE_ attitude _RARE_ , such questions as these : What are the components of the _RARE_ described as alienation
is alienation
its _RARE_ among the various classes and _RARE_ of the population
as a dependent variable , with what _RARE_ factors is it most highly associated
an independent variable , how does it affect behavior in various _RARE_ of life
work is done , there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the _RARE_ of the intellectual , who , rejected by and in turn _RARE_ the larger society , projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen
not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work
I think that alienation is nothing more than a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of the intellectual
saying only that until a _RARE_ and different kind of evidence comes in , any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations
evidence appears , we must make do with the evidence we have
perhaps , Fromm is _RARE_ , for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available , and he sometimes _RARE_ and _RARE_ the evidence in rather special ways
follow
of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the _RARE_ of the corporation , the separation of ownership from control , and the broad ( and thus from the point of view of corporate control , _RARE_ ) _RARE_ of stock ownership
these points he _RARE_ exclusively on _RARE_ and _RARE_ study of _RARE_ , The _RARE_ Corporation And _RARE_ _RARE_
conclusions of that _RARE_ work remain _RARE_ , but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support , has suggested important _RARE_ in the general analytic frame of reference , and has _RARE_ the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area
unaware of these developments
is his very _RARE_ use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of _RARE_ : he _RARE_ such _RARE_ findings just three times
the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible
, he _RARE_ the following data from two studies on job satisfaction : in the first study , 85 per cent of professionals and _RARE_ , _RARE_ per cent of white collar people , and _RARE_ per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs ; ; in the second study , the _RARE_ were _RARE_ for professionals , _RARE_ for _RARE_ persons , 42 for commercial employees , _RARE_ for skilled workers , and _RARE_ for _RARE_ workers
that these data show a `` remarkably high '' percentage of _RARE_ _RARE_ and unhappy persons among factory and _RARE_ workers
other value _RARE_ than Fromm's , some _RARE_ might conclude that the _RARE_ really tell us very little at all , while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low
, for example , once said that America was a _RARE_ -- the only one in the history of the world -- for _RARE_ and small children
is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible , it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied
_RARE_ a _RARE_ on attitudes toward work _RARE_ conducted by the _RARE_ Research Corporation in _RARE_ , in which _RARE_ per cent of _RARE_ workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work , while _RARE_ per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount
these data show that job _RARE_ and _RARE_ are widespread
one way to read the findings , but again there are other ways
use such findings to indicate the strength of _RARE_ primary _RARE_ in the factory , an interpretation which would run counter to Fromm's theory of alienation
he might _RARE_ Fromm that the _RARE_ per cent figure is really _RARE_ low : after all , the medieval _RARE_ system was _RARE_ to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount ; ; and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view
of these _RARE_ in both the amount and the interpretation of _RARE_ findings on public opinion , and considering the criticisms which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical _RARE_ , such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously
people happy , are they as satisfied , unconsciously , as they believe themselves to be
nature of man , and the conditions for happiness , this can hardly be so ''
suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought
to use the term alienation in two different ways
uses it as a subjective , descriptive term , and sometimes as an objective , diagnostic one
, sometimes it is used to describe felt human _RARE_ , and other times it is _RARE_ to explain _RARE_ anxiety and _RARE_
to keep these two _RARE_ distinct presents _RARE_ to the reader
permits Fromm to do some _RARE_ things with empirical findings
is used as an objective and diagnostic category , for example , it becomes clear that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward _RARE_ it
, in effect , does say this in his discussion of the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_
from this , and accepting his estimate of the _RARE_ of modern society , it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a _RARE_ survey which reported widespread , stated worker satisfaction , rather than widespread , stated worker _RARE_
is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious _RARE_ , and which rests on certain ethical _RARE_ , empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is _RARE_ at the moment
in the example _RARE_ above Fromm rests his whole case on the _RARE_ that the workers are being deprived unconsciously , _RARE_ , of _RARE_ , and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious , experienced _RARE_
his _RARE_ and _RARE_ it too : if the workers say they are _RARE_ , this shows conscious alienation ; ; if they say they are satisfied , this shows unconscious alienation
of _RARE_ is especially _RARE_ in Fromm's work because , although his system is derived largely from certain _RARE_ _RARE_ , he _RARE_ that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own _RARE_ room
`` empirical _RARE_ '' label which Fromm claims _RARE_ no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy , it does increase the _RARE_ of his product
example of the failure to use available evidence , though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered , comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same _RARE_
brief chapter dealing with `` _RARE_ Other _RARE_ '' , he _RARE_ isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to _RARE_ his own , and finds it `` most remarkable that a critical view of _RARE_ society was already held by a number of _RARE_ living in the nineteenth
finds it equally `` remarkable that their critical diagnosis and _RARE_ should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the _RARE_ century ''
nothing remarkable about this at all
largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes
a difference between evidence and illustration , and Fromm's _RARE_ of the other _RARE_ _RARE_ the latter category
the list : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , London , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , A. R. _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
a _RARE_ _RARE_ collection
make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear
of selection Fromm uses _RARE_ exactly that
the list is interesting for its _RARE_
, for example , practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English social critics , nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious , and all those who are with more or less accuracy called _RARE_
, the list also _RARE_ all writers who are fairly `` _RARE_ '' about the modern situation ; ; these , almost by definition , are _RARE_ for an _RARE_ _RARE_
not hard to find that _RARE_ of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion
these problems of the use of evidence , one meets another type of difficulty in Fromm's analysis , which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms
instance has already been presented : his use of alienation
other one I shall mention here is his use of the term _RARE_
, _RARE_ is the enemy , the root of all evil
of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one's social criticism , for it makes diagnosis and _RARE_ much easier than they might otherwise be
characteristic _RARE_ Boris _RARE_ , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the _RARE_ -- comes alive in the music
this _RARE_ quality results from _RARE_ care in _RARE_ his vocal line on natural speech _RARE_
he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such _RARE_ as _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , with the same goal in mind , had developed _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to their own languages
_RARE_ in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian _RARE_ as different from others as the language itself
of his musical _RARE_ to the orchestra , he _RARE_ the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words
of _RARE_ melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ his vocal _RARE_ for prolonged expressions of emotion -- _RARE_ first _RARE_ , for example
, the flexibility of the _RARE_ suggests that the word comes first in importance
Boris himself , one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the _RARE_ of musical _RARE_
who appear in only one or two scenes are full _RARE_ , defined with economical precision
four _RARE_ who figure _RARE_ in the action : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and the _RARE_ Rangoni
circumstances could we mistake one for the other ; ; each musical setting has an individual touch
an old man , weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full _RARE_ -- but firm and clear of mind
offers contrast to _RARE_ _RARE_ excitement
but sturdy theme , somewhat _RARE_ in character , appears whenever the old _RARE_ _RARE_ of the history he is recording or of his own past life : This theme comes to represent the outer world , the realm of _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- seen from a distance , quite distinct from the _RARE_ spiritual life in the _RARE_
and _RARE_ according to the text ; ; it _RARE_ _RARE_ when he comes before Boris in the last act
has been identified , however , a new melody is used to accompany his _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ creating a rather ancient effect : An _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ takes on the character he describes , as if he were _RARE_ the old _RARE_ blindness and _RARE_ cure
composer uses a favorite device of his , the _RARE_ of the mood through key relationships
D minor seems to _RARE_ blindness , _RARE_ in spite of all attempts to move away from it
child addresses the _RARE_ in a dream , light -- in the form of the major mode -- begins to appear , and at the moment of the _RARE_ we hear a clear and shining D major
_RARE_ always appear together and often sing together , in a _RARE_ , _RARE_ vigorous _RARE_ that _RARE_ them from the more subtle and _RARE_ _RARE_
song might easily be a folk melody : The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene
origin is humble , their approach to life direct and _RARE_
they may have had in their order doesn't _RARE_ them now
the straight man , not very _RARE_ , _RARE_ when he does speak
loud , _RARE_ , _RARE_ in his _RARE_ and impatient with anyone who is not the same
_RARE_ figure , heard first in the introduction to the _RARE_ scene , _RARE_ him _RARE_ and _RARE_ whenever he comes into the action : The _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , in which this figure becomes a _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the picture of _RARE_ high spirits
is irregular , and the abrupt key changes have a primitive _RARE_
can imagine how they startled _RARE_ of the _RARE_
music begins to _RARE_ as he feels the effects of the wine , but he pulls himself together when the need _RARE_
respond to the _RARE_ challenge with a few phrases of their begging song ; ; a _RARE_ _RARE_ touch is _RARE_ _RARE_ reading of the _RARE_
_RARE_ gradually comes back to him , his rhythm becomes _RARE_ , with the rigid _RARE_ of an _RARE_ reader
only time in the opera , words are not set according to their natural _RARE_ ; ; to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene
_RARE_ , Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional _RARE_ as _RARE_
shows a _RARE_ coupled with an _RARE_ quality that suggest somehow a _RARE_ with _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_
shows none of the native _RARE_ of the Russian characters ; ; in spite of the Italian name , he sounds French
appears more striking by contrast with Marina , who is -- perhaps _RARE_ -- rather _RARE_ characterized
entrance is a musical shock , a sudden open fifth in a key totally _RARE_ to what has preceded it
is as if he had _RARE_ out of nowhere
quietly , _RARE_ his authority beneath a smooth _RARE_ , just as the shifting _RARE_ that accompany him all but hide the firm _RARE_ point beneath them
Marina with great _RARE_ , calling her `` _RARE_ '' at first ; ; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name , placing himself by implication in the position of a _RARE_ father
this scene is a close parallel to one that _RARE_ was writing at the same time , the scene between _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ have the same purpose -- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her _RARE_ cause -- and their _RARE_ are much the same
by _RARE_ the sad state of the Church ; ; this brings a reaction of _RARE_ from Marina
becomes _RARE_ as he calls up a vision of her own _RARE_ : it is she , he tells her , who can bring the truth to Russia and _RARE_ the _RARE_
in a _RARE_ , she _RARE_ his words -- then _RARE_ , with a shock , her own _RARE_
no assignment for a frivolous girl , she _RARE_ him
comes to the point , and we hear , for the first time , a long , downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic _RARE_ of his sinister power
a phrase as _RARE_ as a _RARE_ gesture , with a _RARE_ turn of _RARE_ giving an effect of _RARE_
, _RARE_ chromatic , appears as he _RARE_ her to gain power over _RARE_ by any means , even at the cost of her honor
a _RARE_ , the music sounds as odd as the advice : Marina _RARE_ at this suggestion
is as much at stake as her virtue ; ; she is the _RARE_ beauty , the _RARE_ who turns away _RARE_ by the dozen
_RARE_ Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her
the _RARE_ pulls out all the _RARE_
of a _RARE_ darkness , he describes the powers of _RARE_ _RARE_ control of the girl , _RARE_ her soul with pride and _RARE_ her beauty
threat of _RARE_ and _RARE_ is too much for her , and she falls _RARE_ at his feet
sudden change of mood , he is again calm and _RARE_ , _RARE_ her to trust and _RARE_ him as God's _RARE_ -- and the chromatic scale _RARE_ in ominous contradiction
source of _RARE_ power , Marina is his _RARE_ now ; ; we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene , when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love _RARE_ , again throwing a chill over the atmosphere
unusual feature of Boris , however , is the use of the greatest character of all , the _RARE_
the real _RARE_ of the drama ; ; the conflict is not Boris versus _RARE_ or _RARE_ or even the ghost of the murdered child , but Boris versus the Russian people
this quite clear by the extent to which _RARE_ scenes _RARE_ the action
entrance seems almost a _RARE_ to the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , with its _RARE_ confusion of _RARE_
a brief glimpse of the _RARE_ public personality , the `` official Boris '' , but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with its _RARE_ _RARE_ in the opening scene , its bitter _RARE_ and fury in the final act
for the unique _RARE_ of the _RARE_ is its great variety in expression
_RARE_ as a unit
its most conventional appearance , the _RARE_ song of _RARE_ to Marina , there are a few female _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ for her _RARE_
passages -- for example , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ -- each section of the _RARE_ becomes a character group with a particular opinion
arise between _RARE_ and _RARE_ , who will sing in _RARE_ only when they agree on an idea
scene shows this method at its most individual
a telling picture of the common people , those who must suffer the effects of their _RARE_ struggle for power without understanding the causes
held in control by force , but barely
_RARE_ and _RARE_ for _RARE_ leadership in a _RARE_ intense song , its phrases _RARE_ broken as if _RARE_ for breath , but when the police with their _RARE_ move away , they mock and _RARE_ and fight among themselves
a quick change from the _RARE_ song to a _RARE_ tone
, _RARE_ '' , asks one group , `` what are we shouting about ''
, apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , _RARE_ that he has no notion
and _RARE_ grow louder until the police return ; ; then the people strike up their song with even more _RARE_ than before , ending it with a _RARE_ of despair
uses _RARE_ music with considerable dramatic force
cell the soft _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , heard from _RARE_ , not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young _RARE_ thoughts and his situation
especially striking between _RARE_ quiet exit and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ against Boris
as Boris feels himself _RARE_ death , a _RARE_ files into the hall singing a _RARE_ , its _RARE_ _RARE_ adding a _RARE_ touch to the grim atmosphere : The words are hardly calculated to put the _RARE_ mind at ease
the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ for mercy -- and there is no mercy ''
as well as the dead now accuse him ; ; this final _RARE_ of his guilt is the _RARE_ one
the outstanding assets of the present production is the _RARE_ of the St. _RARE_ scene , usually omitted from _RARE_ and rarely included in a published score
, it has a sharp dramatic edge and great _RARE_
, it is an important link in the plot , giving us a revealing glimpse of the _RARE_ attitude toward Boris and the false _RARE_
in the forest of _RARE_ is a natural _RARE_
_RARE_ scene opens with little groups of _RARE_ milling around the square , the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny
orchestra we hear first a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ figure , then the insistent `` police '' _RARE_ as it appeared in the opening scene
is over , and a number of people come from the church with their _RARE_ _RARE_ in the lead
the news that the _RARE_ has been _RARE_ ; ; this is met with _RARE_ by the _RARE_ , who claim that _RARE_ is lying or drunk
_RARE_ contrasts the two groups by their _RARE_ _RARE_ , solemn _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_
is still more news , _RARE_ _RARE_ : they have prayed for the soul of the _RARE_
these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have _RARE_ assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a _RARE_ at a single stage of development
, Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max _RARE_ period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic _RARE_
odd when one _RARE_ that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` _RARE_ '' is dated `` between _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' ; ; `` Seeing The _RARE_ _RARE_ '' is dated August , _RARE_
expect that in a poetic career of _RARE_ years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place
not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense
time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of _RARE_ flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost _RARE_ consistency
struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the _RARE_ of his _RARE_ ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to _RARE_ , written when Hardy was _RARE_ years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' _RARE_ entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not _RARE_ us : it only _RARE_ us '' ( Early Life , p. _RARE_ )
in his later years he revised his poems many times , the _RARE_ did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one
only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his
only one Hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only _RARE_ evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time
later poems , however , the personal tone _RARE_
early poems are bad _RARE_ or bad _RARE_ ; ; the bad late poems are bad Hardy
two ways of getting at a _RARE_ development : through his dated poems , and through the _RARE_ which he made in later _RARE_ of his work
quarter of Hardy's poems carry an _RARE_ date line , usually the year of completion , but sometimes _RARE_ years ( `` _RARE_ - 1910 '' ) or two separate dates when Hardy worked on the poem ( `` _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' ) or an approximate date ( `` During the War '' )
are virtually the only _RARE_ we have to the _RARE_ of the poems , since the separate volumes are neither _RARE_ within themselves nor in relation to each other
exception of _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ sixty-one years ) ; ; the internal organization rarely has any _RARE_ order , except in obvious groups like the `` _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' , the `` _RARE_ of 1912 - 13 '' , and the war poems
dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry , always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative
poems suggest that while Hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant , his production was not
two productive periods , one in the late _RARE_ , the other in the decade from 1910 to _RARE_ ( half of the dated poems are from the latter period , and these alone total about _RARE_ of all Hardy's poems )
one _RARE_ period : only one poem is dated between _RARE_ and _RARE_ and , except for the poems written on the trip to Italy in _RARE_ , very few from _RARE_ to _RARE_
poems also give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past _RARE_ for his various volumes , and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time
The _RARE_ And The Present and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , both published while Hardy was at work on The _RARE_ , draw heavily on poems written before _RARE_
_RARE_ and _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , coming during his most productive decade , are relatively _RARE_ ; ; the former contains no poem dated before _RARE_ - 10 -- that is , no poem from a period covered by a previous volume -- and the latter has only a few such
three volumes are again more dependent on the past , as Hardy's creative powers _RARE_ in his old age
about Hardy's productivity _RARE_ with the details of his life as we know them
productive period came when he was considering poetry as a _RARE_ , before he had decided to write _RARE_ for a living ( in his note for Who's Who he wrote that he `` wrote _RARE_ _RARE_ - _RARE_ ; ; gave up verse for _RARE_ , _RARE_ - 70 ; ; but resumed it later '' )
_RARE_ _RARE_ years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was , in addition , _RARE_ with bad health ( he spent six months in bed in _RARE_ , too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at A _RARE_ )
in The Early Life support the assumption that during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry
records that `` at the end of November ( _RARE_ ) he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible '' ( Early Life , p. _RARE_ ) ; ; and on Christmas Day , _RARE_ , Hardy wrote : `` While thinking of _RARE_ ' the _RARE_ _RARE_ Of _RARE_ before dawn this morning , new _RARE_ seemed to open , and _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ '' ( Early Life , p. _RARE_ )
more poems dated in the _RARE_ than in the _RARE_ -- Hardy had apparently resumed the _RARE_ wings as he decreased the volume of his _RARE_ -- but none in _RARE_ , the year of _RARE_ , and only one in _RARE_ , the year of _RARE_
the number increases , and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated poem -- _RARE_ , when Hardy was at work on The _RARE_
productive period , the decade from 1910 to _RARE_ , can be related to three events : the completion of The _RARE_ in _RARE_ , which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years ; ; the death of Emma Hardy in 1912 , which had a profound emotional effect on Hardy for which he found release in poetry ; ; and the First World War
seem strange that a poet should come to full _RARE_ in his _RARE_ , but we have it on Hardy's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen , a youth till he was _RARE_ , and a young man till he was nearly fifty '' ( Early Life , p. 42 )
carry this sequence one step further and say that at _RARE_ he was a poet at the height of his powers , wanting only the _RARE_ of two _RARE_ , one personal , the other national , to loose those powers in poetry
productive decades were separated by forty years , yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself -- it was a _RARE_ , not an expanding process
wise _RARE_ , Hardy _RARE_ away the _RARE_ _RARE_ and songs , and the elements of _RARE_ and poetic _RARE_ to which his personal style was not suited , and let the main stock of his talent _RARE_
of the later poetry is considerably _RARE_ , but the number of successful poems is far greater
see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities : `` _RARE_ '' ( _RARE_ ) and `` Neutral _RARE_ '' ( _RARE_ )
not much to be said for `` _RARE_ ''
half of the _RARE_ - 70 poems , it is a _RARE_ on a conventional theme -- the _RARE_ of love
could have written it ; ; it is competent in the sense that it makes a _RARE_ statement without _RARE_ the rules of the _RARE_ form , but it is entirely _RARE_ and entirely unlike Hardy
is the conventional language of the form ; ; there is no phrase or image that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give _RARE_ to the poem
_RARE_ than Hardy usually is , but with the _RARE_ of _RARE_
obviously a young man's poem , written out of books and not out of experience ; ; it _RARE_ emotion without _RARE_ it -- that is to say , it is _RARE_
many such _RARE_ anonymous _RARE_ among the earlier poems
_RARE_ '' we immediately recognize as a fine poem in Hardy's most characteristic style : the plain but not quite _RARE_ language , the hard , particular , _RARE_ images , the slightly odd _RARE_ , the dramatic handling of the occasion , the refusal to _RARE_ the issue -- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems
does not _RARE_ the _RARE_ of ordinary speech nor draw on _RARE_ sources of _RARE_ , yet it is obviously not ordinary speech -- only Hardy would say `` a grin of bitterness swept thereby ; ; like an ominous bird _RARE_ '' , or `` _RARE_ with wrong '' , or would describe a winter sun as `` _RARE_ ''
of the setting of `` Neutral _RARE_ '' are not , strictly speaking , _RARE_ , but they _RARE_ to create a mood which is appropriate both to a _RARE_ winter day and to the end of love , and in this way love and weather , the emotions and the elements , _RARE_ each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's best poems ( `` _RARE_ '' , `` The _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , and `` During _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , for example ) and to some moving passages in the novels as well ( Far From The _RARE_ _RARE_ is full of scenes constructed in this way )
_RARE_ '' is an excellent example of Hardy's mature style , drawn from his earliest productive period ; ; I _RARE_ it as evidence that he did not develop through new _RARE_ as he grew older ( as _RARE_ did ) , but that he simply learned to use better what he already had
poem we recognize and _RARE_ one man's sense of the world ; ; if it is _RARE_ , it is also precise , and the precision _RARE_ authority to the vision
_RARE_ '' , on the other hand , the _RARE_ is a case not _RARE_ ; ; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the _RARE_ right to speak as he does
_RARE_ - 70 decade there are many poems like `` _RARE_ '' , but there is only one `` Neutral _RARE_ ''
not Hardy very often
_RARE_ of 1912 - 13 '' offer a good example of Hardy's style as it was _RARE_ in the later productive decade
the poems Hardy wrote after the death of his first wife ; ; they _RARE_ a painful _RARE_ to what might have been , to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness , and ended in long years of suffering and hatred
felt that these poems were _RARE_ personal and private ; ; he sometimes called them `` an _RARE_ '' , and he would not allow them to be published in _RARE_
the only poems that he _RARE_ as a group between their first appearance ( in _RARE_ Of _RARE_ ) and the publication of the _RARE_ _RARE_
tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice , and it is not surprising that the 1912 - 13 poems are consistently and _RARE_ his
is always toward the past ; ; but the mood is not quite _RARE_ -- Hardy would not allow sentiment to _RARE_ his sense of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the past , and the eternal _RARE_ of the dead
are , the _RARE_ tells us , the `` _RARE_ of an ancient flame '' ; ; the fire of love is dead , and Hardy stands , as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence , over the _RARE_ circle of _RARE_ sticks , and thinks of past happiness and present grief , honest and _RARE_
, modern _RARE_ , like _RARE_ and _RARE_ , is perceived only by its effects at more _RARE_ social levels , where it is called _RARE_
'' , by the way , is the term used by the _RARE_ and poet , Lawrence _RARE_ , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as _RARE_ : `` We _RARE_
John L. Lewis
_RARE_ of _RARE_ , like two ruined _RARE_ guarding the entrance to one of _RARE_ circles , stand two great dead _RARE_ _RARE_ -- the _RARE_ of the post-war generation : the great _RARE_ , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas
word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves
them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely _RARE_ art
them were my friends
San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not _RARE_ by _RARE_ or fatigue
the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal _RARE_
time I saw _RARE_ , at _RARE_ _RARE_ City , he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there
happened , man ''
, referring to the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
, man , evil '' , he said , and that's all he said for the rest of the night
he got up to blow
crowd _RARE_ into stillness and the _RARE_ melody _RARE_ through it
time I saw Dylan , his _RARE_ had not just passed the limits of _RARE_
assumed the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ matter
him was like being swept away by a _RARE_ of falling _RARE_
Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same _RARE_ end
, they were very similar
both very _RARE_
_RARE_ , enchanting _RARE_ had , compared with important artists of the past , relatively little content
them got very far beyond a sort of _RARE_ _RARE_ at his own _RARE_
theme of Thomas's poetry was the _RARE_ of birth and death -- the pain of _RARE_ creation
of course , is not so explicit an art , but anybody who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift
them did communicate one central theme : _RARE_ the ruin of the world , there is only one defense -- the creative act
of course , is the theme of much art -- perhaps most poetry
the theme of _RARE_ , who certainly otherwise bears little _RARE_ to Parker or Thomas
is that _RARE_ accepted his theme with a kind of _RARE_ assurance
and _RARE_ it was an agony and terror
not believe that this is due to anything especially _RARE_ about their relationship to their own _RARE_
rather that it is due to the _RARE_ world in which that _RARE_ seemed to be the sole value
of _RARE_ verse _RARE_ quietly enough in the _RARE_ air of _RARE_ Rome
have been for him the most _RARE_ , orderly , and noble activity of man
other activities of his life _RARE_ of these values
not _RARE_ _RARE_ them
verse had to find _RARE_ in a world of burning cities and burning Jews
able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air _RARE_ and gas _RARE_
world began to take on the _RARE_ of an _RARE_ air _RARE_ or gas _RARE_ , I believe his art became meaningless to him
all this could apply to Parker just as well , although , because of the nature of music , it is not _RARE_ -- at least not conclusively
Parker have more in common than theme , attitude , life pattern
practice of their art , there is an obvious technical _RARE_
popular belief , they were not great technical _RARE_
are only _RARE_ startling
a regression from the technical _RARE_ and _RARE_ of writers like Pierre _RARE_ or _RARE_
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , and of Parker particularly , have been _RARE_ _RARE_ by people unfamiliar with music , especially by that _RARE_ , the intellectual _RARE_ , the jazz _RARE_
_RARE_ consist in the introduction of a few _RARE_ used in classical music for centuries
is less _RARE_ difference between progressive jazz , no matter how progressive , and _RARE_ , than there is between two movements of many conventional _RARE_
and his _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , Davis , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ( _RARE_ is an _RARE_ ) , etc. -- did was to absorb the musical _RARE_ of the older jazz into the basic structure , of which it then became an integral part , and with which it then developed
true of the _RARE_ line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
true of the _RARE_ pattern in which the beat _RARE_ continuously , or at least is continuously _RARE_ , so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be _RARE_ by the long _RARE_ of the phrase or _RARE_
exactly what happened in the transition from _RARE_ to _RARE_ music
the difference between _RARE_ and _RARE_
not a _RARE_ _RARE_ to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry
_RARE_ effects of a _RARE_ or an _RARE_ _RARE_ -- actually _RARE_ -- become the main concern
_RARE_ , which _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ still dominant in _RARE_ American colleges , were _RARE_
and _RARE_ are ends in themselves
theme , if it exists , is _RARE_ , and his main theme -- the terror of birth -- is simply _RARE_
one difference between _RARE_ and Dylan which should be pointed out
contrary to popular belief , there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either _RARE_ or emotionally
melody is a sort of naive _RARE_ of all experience
does not _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ ; ; it _RARE_ _RARE_
true also of a painter like Jackson Pollock
have been _RARE_ in his behavior , but his paintings are as _RARE_ as _RARE_ _RARE_
difference is due to the nature of verbal communication
_RARE_ of the general environment _RARE_ into even the most _RARE_ poetry
much more a personal difference
wanted to tell people about the ruin and _RARE_ of the world
Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world
and simple , _RARE_ , is not of major importance , but it is interesting that Parker , following Lester Young , was one of the leaders of the so-called _RARE_ revolution
jazz , the _RARE_ is treated as a _RARE_ and played with conventional _RARE_
Thomas's verse was extremely conventional , as was , _RARE_ , the verse of that other _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts
_RARE_ in the _RARE_ of structure
by Dylan Thomas , a _RARE_ _RARE_ by Charles Parker , a painting by Jackson Pollock -- these are pure _RARE_ as ends in themselves
come to determine structure
should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the _RARE_ , _RARE_ invention of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , or present _RARE_ of poetic _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ had little influence on anyone except very _RARE_ writers -- like _RARE_ _RARE_ , for instance , to whom _RARE_ was the last word in modern poetry and the _RARE_ of an _RARE_ , let alone a _RARE_ _RARE_ were _RARE_ -- so Dylan Thomas's influence has been slight indeed
, his only _RARE_ -- the only person to _RARE_ his style -- was W. S. _RARE_ , who seems to have _RARE_ him without much understanding , and who has since moved on to other methods
influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now _RARE_ British romantic school of the New _RARE_ -- Henry _RARE_ , J. F. _RARE_ , and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets
had much more of an influence
time it was the ambition of every _RARE_ player in every high school band in America to blow like _RARE_
his death this influence had begun to _RARE_
, the whole generation of the founding _RARE_ of _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Davis , _RARE_ , and the rest -- are just now at a considerable discount
line of development today goes back to Lester Young and _RARE_ them
is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts _RARE_ are _RARE_ , _RARE_
no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be _RARE_ from _RARE_ to _RARE_ , or for that matter , from _RARE_ through Henry James to _RARE_ _RARE_
generation before World War 1 , , and , on a lower level , the _RARE_ of the period between the wars , both assumed an accepted universe of _RARE_ , in which , to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , it was possible to make definite advances , exactly as in the sciences
if anyone holds such ideas today
, but like the _RARE_ music developed from Lester Young , it is a _RARE_ sustained by popular demand
plastic arts , a very similar situation exists
Hans _RARE_ and Max _RARE_ might talk of creation by _RARE_ -- of _RARE_ pictures by walking on them with painted _RARE_ , or by _RARE_ _RARE_ of paper up in the air
is obvious that they were _RARE_
anything like an _RARE_ or an _RARE_ but another _RARE_ or _RARE_
less like their work than the _RARE_ of random occasion
the _RARE_ War 2 , abstract _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the discipline of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , look _RARE_ , and do look like _RARE_
appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist , but it is a very _RARE_ appeal
what has happened is an _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of painting
curious that at its best , the work of this school of painting -- Mark _RARE_ , Jackson Pollock , _RARE_ Still , Robert _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the rest -- _RARE_ nothing so much as the passage painting of quite _RARE_ _RARE_ : the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the background of a Henry _RARE_ , itself a formula derived from _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ of light and black which _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_
of this sort is presented as _RARE_ -- the pure _RARE_ of the brush _RARE_ seeking only absolute _RARE_ values
only to compare such painting with the work of , say , _RARE_ , to realize that someone is using words and _RARE_ _RARE_
best the abstract _RARE_ achieve a simple _RARE_ _RARE_ surface
shows up immediately when compared with _RARE_ , where the _RARE_ rises to painting of extraordinary _RARE_ and power
painting , however _RARE_ , is a universe of _RARE_ in vast depths
is an object of art -- _RARE_ -- _RARE_ only by its great size
, once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall , it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper
is nothing wrong with complicated wallpaper
just more to _RARE_
_RARE_ brush _RARE_ painted _RARE_ , too -- at least _RARE_ ones , screens
of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long
in the last couple of years , abstract _RARE_ has tended toward romantic suggestion -- _RARE_ of landscape or living figures
Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the _RARE_ of verse in the heroic age
_RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ at _RARE_ ( lines _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) , and _RARE_ the tale of _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ comparison of the _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ ( lines _RARE_ - _RARE_ ) ; ; _RARE_ court _RARE_ _RARE_ of the discovered _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ ( Odyssey 8 _RARE_ ) , and takes up a tale of _RARE_ while the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ on ( Odyssey 8 _RARE_ )
all this is _RARE_ : unlike the poets of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , _RARE_ blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind _RARE_ _RARE_
of these _RARE_ of _RARE_ without writing is intended to _RARE_ a _RARE_ into the epic matter , there is _RARE_ evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition
a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny
_RARE_ _RARE_ the observation that the _RARE_ Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to _RARE_ that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete _RARE_ of Greek epic survived ; ; he further _RARE_ that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely _RARE_ that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas
_RARE_ conclusions and _RARE_ one of his _RARE_ , _RARE_ P. _RARE_ , Jr. , _RARE_ that Beowulf likewise was created from a _RARE_ of oral formulas inherited and extended by _RARE_ of _RARE_ generations , and the _RARE_ is striking and _RARE_
fresh inspection will indicate one crucial _RARE_ : Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent
_RARE_ by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very _RARE_ oral poet , but it appears safe to assume that no sustained _RARE_ in _RARE_ could be composed without extreme difficulty , even in a language of many terminal _RARE_
nearly as severe a curb , although in a _RARE_ passage William of _RARE_ _RARE_ that A _RARE_ Of _RARE_ was _RARE_ before the battle _RARE_ at _RARE_
_RARE_ line and the Homeric _RARE_ probably imposed less of a _RARE_ ; ; the verse of Beowulf or of The Iliad and The Odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ a _RARE_
aids were valuable and quite _RARE_ necessary for _RARE_ long _RARE_ of verse without a pause
in a written tradition who generally never _RARE_ a line may once in a while pause and _RARE_ without _RARE_ blame
oral poet cannot pause ; ; he must _RARE_ continuously with no apparent effort
the _RARE_ of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously _RARE_ unless he has aids to _RARE_ rapid composition
poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of _RARE_ ; ; the Homeric poet had epithets , which provided for _RARE_ needs in the _RARE_
could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he _RARE_ out his lines , because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous _RARE_ for the chief common and proper _RARE_
could of course serve the same function , and for the sake of ease I shall speak of kennings and epithets in the _RARE_ and _RARE_ possible sense , and name , for example , _RARE_ a _RARE_ for the _RARE_
_RARE_ elements too _RARE_ in each epic _RARE_ , but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large _RARE_ and _RARE_ supply of semantic _RARE_ , and to _RARE_ the members of any system of _RARE_ as basic formulas of the poetic language
a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other _RARE_ _RARE_ , we cannot say how frequently the kennings in Beowulf _RARE_ in contemporary epic on the same soil
can say that since a writing poet , with _RARE_ before him , would seem unlikely to _RARE_ a technique based upon frequent and substantial _RARE_ , the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be _RARE_ to an oral tradition
the greatest _RARE_ of our time , _RARE_ M. _RARE_ , _RARE_ that when it is assumed The Iliad and The Odyssey are oral poems , the _RARE_ single _RARE_ called _RARE_ cannot be either _RARE_ with or denied _RARE_ in choice of _RARE_
of grand or _RARE_ _RARE_ may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous _RARE_ into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown _RARE_
of the historical _RARE_ is likely never to have further success ; ; no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be _RARE_ to any one man ; ; no _RARE_ effective element of speech in the _RARE_ poems can with assurance be said not to have been a _RARE_ in the _RARE_ epic _RARE_ that may have existed at the beginning of the first _RARE_ before Christ
is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well
extent that a tale is twice told , its final author must be suspect , although _RARE_ in an oral tradition is less a _RARE_ than the standard _RARE_ _RARE_
further , and here he makes his main point , that once The Iliad and The Odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry , Homeric critics are deprived of an entire _RARE_ they previously found _RARE_
few important and a few more _RARE_ exceptions , no expression can be deemed _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ for its context , because each was very probably the only expression that _RARE_ practice and ease of rapid _RARE_ would allow
phrases that _RARE_ have admired as handsome or _RARE_ or _RARE_ must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable _RARE_ , sometimes accurate and sometimes not
too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry
extent that a language is formulaic , its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other _RARE_
_RARE_ suggests that certain kennings in Beowulf were selected sometimes for _RARE_ and sometimes for _RARE_ _RARE_ , but such a view would appear _RARE_ unless it is denied that the language of Beowulf is formulaic
master of _RARE_ who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional , he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards _RARE_ and sophisticated _RARE_ of speech elements
significant phrases are found in theory or in _RARE_ practice to provide for _RARE_ necessity , they are not to be _RARE_ for their semantic properties in isolated _RARE_
false to be certain of having discovered in the language of Beowulf such effects as _RARE_ _RARE_
if the argument is turned _RARE_ , there may be found a great deal in _RARE_ view , after all
element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection
though the _RARE_ expressions are , they may nevertheless be handsome or _RARE_ or _RARE_
_RARE_ in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things , and these formulas are therefore _RARE_ rather than always actually accurate
we do not know how they were regarded in their day , but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more _RARE_ to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read _RARE_ or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to _RARE_ in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases
_RARE_ in a written tradition are chosen for the _RARE_ ; ; in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic _RARE_ , and tend towards _RARE_ rather than _RARE_ _RARE_
therefore not to be placed upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ in an oral poem ; ; _RARE_ today would hope to discover the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ or the _RARE_ of _RARE_
at _RARE_ could be called a _RARE_ _RARE_ in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek
_RARE_ of weapons the _RARE_ would be _RARE_ ( as their _RARE_ is _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ would be _RARE_
like _RARE_ in The _RARE_ , is _RARE_ the _RARE_ of men and may _RARE_ be called _RARE_ even when he stands _RARE_
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ is used deliberately and _RARE_ , but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the _RARE_ `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the _RARE_ ''
language was not entirely the _RARE_ of the poet ; ; it was partly his master
intentions are difficult to _RARE_ and , except to _RARE_ , _RARE_ ; ; the language , however , is a proper object of scrutiny , and the effects of the language are _RARE_ even if sometimes inevitable
the Homeric poems appear oral compositions
are written ; ; at some stage in their _RARE_ they were _RARE_
Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were _RARE_ to a _RARE_ by a _RARE_ who held in his mind the poems fully _RARE_ but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ that the Beowulf poet and _RARE_ may have _RARE_ their verse in the same fashion
is attractive , but is _RARE_ at least in part by the observation that _RARE_ , though he used kennings in the traditional manner , was a _RARE_ man who four times inscribed his name by _RARE_ into his works
was _RARE_ , the Beowulf poet may have been also , and so may the final _RARE_ of The Iliad and The Odyssey
of the _RARE_ to the blind or _RARE_ _RARE_ , one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry _RARE_ , and became _RARE_ familiar with the established aids to _RARE_ , and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past
of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory : Beowulf may contain a design for terror , and The Iliad may have a vast _RARE_ pattern answering to a _RARE_ pattern produced during the Geometric _RARE_ in pottery
of the growth and final _RARE_ of these _RARE_ rests partly , however , upon the degree to which they were formulaic
_RARE_ counted _RARE_ different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems , and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight _RARE_ he counted _RARE_ different lines used a total of _RARE_ times
line in five from The Iliad and The Odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems
is thoroughly remarkable , because the lines are so long -- half again as long as those of Beowulf
appears to have no comparable amount of repetition ; ; there is no reason to think that the _RARE_ used and _RARE_ whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric _RARE_
the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is _RARE_ , however , to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their _RARE_ , for a stock of _RARE_ would be sufficient to permit the poet to _RARE_ with _RARE_ if they provided for _RARE_ needs
scrutiny is _RARE_ to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets ; ; if any words or phrases are formulaic , they will be
has two words for the shield , _RARE_ and _RARE_
of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and _RARE_ content , to show , as M. D. _RARE_ has said of Dickens generally , that much of the _RARE_ impact _RARE_ in its `` _RARE_ _RARE_ and moral _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how _RARE_ that novel can be read from such a perspective
analysis , however , he _RARE_ upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a _RARE_ feature of the _RARE_
_RARE_ to make that exploration
not for nothing the most _RARE_ of the great _RARE_ writers
_RARE_ that next to voice and face an _RARE_ hands are his most useful possession -- that in _RARE_ as in the theatre , gesture is an _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ character and _RARE_ action and response
hardly _RARE_ , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do _RARE_ or _RARE_ things with their hands
Expectations the hands become almost an _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ his forefinger , a gesture which _RARE_ both _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ that half _RARE_ , half _RARE_ all who have _RARE_ with him
_RARE_ hands , heavy as if her _RARE_ were somehow concentrated in them , move in _RARE_ _RARE_ between her broken heart and her walking stick
_RARE_ '' is the _RARE_ extended glad hand
his _RARE_ by regularly rubbing his hands together
_RARE_ frantic response to life _RARE_ with a useless , _RARE_ wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair '' and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it '' , whereas Joe _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ of Mrs. Joe by _RARE_ drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose ''
would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of _RARE_ novels , hands serve as a _RARE_ of plot and theme -- a kind of _RARE_ symbol or natural _RARE_ for the _RARE_ complex of human _RARE_ and the values and attitudes that _RARE_ them
only reveals character through gesture , he makes hands a crucial element of the plot , a means of _RARE_ the structure of the novel by helping to define the _RARE_ relations with all the major characters , and a device for ordering such _RARE_ _RARE_ as guilt , pursuit , crime , _RARE_ , education , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ( by both people and institutions ) , friendship , romantic love , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
only to think of Lady _RARE_ or the _RARE_ in Thomas _RARE_ famous story , `` The _RARE_ Of Mr. _RARE_ '' , to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment
is with Great Expectations , whether the hands be _RARE_ as he strikes down Mrs. _RARE_ or Pip's as he _RARE_ a _RARE_ from her _RARE_
suit well with the _RARE_ or _RARE_ aspects of _RARE_ novel , but , on a deeper plane , they _RARE_ to the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , guilt , and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics
opens with a _RARE_ _RARE_ frantically trying to avoid the _RARE_ of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the _RARE_ `` as if he were _RARE_ the hands of the dead people , stretching up _RARE_ out of their _RARE_ , to get a _RARE_ upon his ankle and pull him in ''
Pip into _RARE_ a pork _RARE_ for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a _RARE_ man who may `` softly creep his way to him and _RARE_ him open '' , `` _RARE_ his hands '' in him
_RARE_ over the theft that his own hands have committed , his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local _RARE_ , _RARE_ it into `` a _RARE_ devoting me to the _RARE_ ''
down in the _RARE_ , Pip _RARE_ in terror `` with both hands '' to his _RARE_ ; ; later he _RARE_ in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who _RARE_ holds out a pair of _RARE_ which he has brought to _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_
details Dickens indicates at the _RARE_ that guilt is a part of the _RARE_ bond between Pip and _RARE_ which is so _RARE_ to alter both their lives
commonly translate thoughts and feelings into _RARE_ , hands naturally represent action , and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the _RARE_ or closely allied to it , the _RARE_ of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at
for excellent psychological reasons , never fully reveals _RARE_ _RARE_ past , but Pip , at the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in London , _RARE_ from _RARE_ a hand which he fears `` might be stained with blood ''
about the _RARE_ `` like _RARE_ '' with `` his hands in his pockets '' , and when he _RARE_ _RARE_ at Mrs. Joe for _RARE_ to his holiday , she _RARE_ her hands in a _RARE_ , _RARE_ them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees '' , and _RARE_ them in her husband's hair
`` _RARE_ '' is only the _RARE_ to the vicious blow upon her head , `` dealt by some unknown hand '' whose identity is later revealed not _RARE_ but through a _RARE_ action -- the tracing of _RARE_ hammer upon a _RARE_
is to feel the terror of _RARE_ `` _RARE_ hand '' in his secret rendezvous at the _RARE_ on the _RARE_
great emphasis on the hands in this scene
his hand at Pip , _RARE_ the table with his fist , draws his _RARE_ hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth _RARE_ '' for his _RARE_ , _RARE_ his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides '' , and Pip _RARE_ him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers ''
almost be _RARE_ _RARE_ man come alive , a figure of _RARE_ from Pip's _RARE_ of guilt
, _RARE_ _RARE_ of Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_ are the _RARE_ marks of her sinister past , for her master , _RARE_ _RARE_ them to his dinner guests , makes a point of the `` force of grip there is in these hands ''
control over her ( `` she would remove her hands from any _RARE_ she put before him , _RARE_ , as if she _RARE_ his calling her back ) '' ) rests on his having once got her _RARE_ of a murder charge by _RARE_ _RARE_ her _RARE_ at the trial to _RARE_ her strength and by passing off the _RARE_ on the backs of her hands as the _RARE_ of _RARE_ rather than of human _RARE_
the similarity between _RARE_ hands and _RARE_ ( `` The action of her fingers was like the action of _RARE_ '' ) that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and _RARE_ a symbolic connection between the _RARE_ of crime and the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ House
_RARE_ pursuit of _RARE_ , his _RARE_ and _RARE_ , begins by his holding him in a _RARE_ grip on the river _RARE_ to _RARE_ his escape and _RARE_ in his `` _RARE_ his hand on his _RARE_ to identify him '' , thus _RARE_ the _RARE_ struggle in the water during which _RARE_ _RARE_
here _RARE_ becomes the agent of justice
in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens , is here central , and hands are often associated in some way with the false values -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ -- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of _RARE_
the economic _RARE_ of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers `` who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle '' , who seemed to have `` all been born on their backs with their hands in their _RARE_ , and had never taken them out in this state of existence ''
expectations , his progress through illusion and _RARE_ , turn , somewhat as they do for the naive hero of _RARE_ American _RARE_ , upon the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ through _RARE_ income -- what _RARE_ calls `` _RARE_ property '' and what _RARE_ _RARE_ Pip for letting `` slip through ( his ) fingers ''
gentleman must , if possible , avoid _RARE_ them by work , his hands , as _RARE_ as his _RARE_ , become the index of social status
first step in the _RARE_ of Pip's values is the _RARE_ shame he feels when _RARE_ _RARE_ remarks the _RARE_ of his hands : `` They had never troubled me before , but they troubled me now , as _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
how _RARE_ would look down upon _RARE_ hands , _RARE_ by work in the _RARE_ , and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his _RARE_ ones is made to _RARE_ the opposition of values between which Pip _RARE_ -- _RARE_ and work , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and affection -- in fact , between _RARE_ House and the _RARE_
_RARE_ that _RARE_ Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the _RARE_ is marked by an embarrassed _RARE_ at which Pip _RARE_ : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your _RARE_ hand ''
_RARE_ of Miss _RARE_ , during which he _RARE_ to kiss her hand , _RARE_ his _RARE_ to a supposed _RARE_ who seems to be opening up for him a new world of _RARE_ ; ; when , on the journey to London that immediately follows , he _RARE_ _RARE_ to lay his hand upon the _RARE_ at the end of the village , the wooden _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ a spiritual _RARE_ between _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_
one cannot miss the significance of this gesture , for Dickens _RARE_ it _RARE_ in Pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis -- his painful recognition , in a talk with _RARE_ _RARE_ , that his _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ is as _RARE_ as it is romantic
cases the _RARE_ represents Pip's _RARE_ awareness of contrary _RARE_
of hand movements helps _RARE_ the moral climate of the fallen world Pip _RARE_ beyond the _RARE_
_RARE_ of the _RARE_ family upon Miss _RARE_ is _RARE_ up in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ , who puts her hand to her throat in a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ choking , then _RARE_ it `` upon her _RARE_ bosom '' with `` an _RARE_ _RARE_ of manner '' , and finally _RARE_ it to Miss _RARE_ in a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ own _RARE_ toward _RARE_

operation _RARE_ is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers ( see page 85 )
Certain Autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand ( columns 21 - 75 ) of a single line on the Autocoder _RARE_ sheet
is the case , the appropriate section of this _RARE_ will indicate that `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' may be used
when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the Autocoder _RARE_ sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow
and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be _RARE_ in the operand column of the _RARE_ sheet
need not extend across the entire operand column of either the _RARE_ card or continuation cards but may end with the _RARE_ following any parameter
appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces
the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples _RARE_ the various statements
continuation card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards , the _RARE_ will _RARE_ a _RARE_ and issue an error message
regarding the use of continuation cards with _RARE_ appear on page _RARE_
index words and electronic switches The assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index word and electronic switch names occurs in _RARE_ 3 , of the Autocoder _RARE_
availability of index words and electronic switches is determined by a table which is included in the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ indicates that index words 1 through _RARE_ and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for assignment to symbolic references ; ; index words _RARE_ through _RARE_ are not available
setting of this table may be altered , however , as described in the _RARE_ Data _RARE_ System Bulletin `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ System : _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , form Aj
first pass of _RARE_ 3 , , references to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches are collected and the availability table is _RARE_
end of this pass , the table indicates which index words and electronic switches are not available for assignment to symbolic references
words and electronic switches may have been made _RARE_ before the start of assignment in one of the following ways

setting of the availability table indicated that the index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment

or _RARE_ number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify _RARE_ or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic switch , e.g. , 3
or _RARE_ number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an _RARE_ statement , e.g. , When the index words or electronic switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements described above , the position or order of the statements within the program is not important ; ; any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch _RARE_ at the end of this pass
assignment pass of _RARE_ 3 , , index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment
and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways
two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches ; ; the third applies only to index words

assignment pass , each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch
a reference is found , an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment

_RARE_ or _RARE_ address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an _RARE_ or _RARE_ statement ( see page _RARE_ ) , the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved

statement has been assigned an address in the index word area by means of an actual label or by means of an origin statement which refers to an actual address , the corresponding index word will be reserved
should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each _RARE_ statement
symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words
method does not apply to electronic switches
preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a _RARE_ or _RARE_ program , particularly when used in conjunction with the _RARE_ statement
should be used , however , to avoid the _RARE_ usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address
symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an _RARE_ or _RARE_ statement ( see page _RARE_ ) , the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available , regardless of the method by which it was reserved
not , however , be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time
at any time during the assignment pass , the _RARE_ finds that there are no more index words available for assignment , the warning message `` No More _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' will be placed in the object program _RARE_ , the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through _RARE_ are available , and the assignment will continue as before
_RARE_ finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment , the warning message `` No More _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' will be placed in the object program _RARE_ , the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available , and assignment will continue as before
_RARE_ usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used , e.g. , through the proper use of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ statements
in Appendix C , index words _RARE_ through _RARE_ are never available for assignment to symbolic names by the _RARE_ ; ; also , index words _RARE_ through _RARE_ may have been made _RARE_ for assignment
Autocoder declarative statements provide the _RARE_ with the necessary information to complete the _RARE_ operations properly
are never _RARE_ in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area , placed preferably at its beginning or end
special care must be taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to _RARE_ something in a data area as an instruction

_RARE_ , oxidation ponds are used _RARE_ for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas
cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive _RARE_ have created the need for a _RARE_ treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume
_RARE_ , _RARE_ on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to _RARE_ mg/l with _RARE_ from 8 to _RARE_ _RARE_
indicates that _RARE_ from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds
by _RARE_ and _RARE_ had indicated that a _RARE_ aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer
showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 _RARE_ of oxygen / _RARE_ / _RARE_
_RARE_ discussed the use of aerated _RARE_ for _RARE_ organic _RARE_
that a _RARE_ retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to _RARE_ per cent BOD reduction
_RARE_ increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months
from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume
_RARE_ With the development of the Red Bridge _RARE_ south of _RARE_ City , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal
system from _RARE_ City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years
the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 Aj
initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1
pond has a surface area of _RARE_ acres and a depth of 4 Aj
is currently serving _RARE_ persons or _RARE_ persons per _RARE_
summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
possible to maintain _RARE_ conditions in the pond by regular _RARE_ of sodium _RARE_ until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from _RARE_ to green algae
conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium _RARE_
same time further expansion in the Red Bridge _RARE_ required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities
land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment _RARE_ _RARE_ to the _RARE_
proposed that aerated _RARE_ be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development
The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system _RARE_ the _RARE_ to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its _RARE_ for _RARE_ domestic sewage
plant was a circular lagoon _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ at the surface and _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ at the bottom , 4 _RARE_ below the surface , with a volume of _RARE_ Aj
_RARE_ were _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ to prevent _RARE_
lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area
_RARE_ was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the _RARE_ developed
lagoon was designed to handle the _RARE_ from _RARE_ persons with a _RARE_ _RARE_ period
the _RARE_ would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an _RARE_ period
would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period of time
plant was equipped with a _RARE_ _RARE_ aerator ( Figure 2 )
had a _RARE_ drive to permit operation through a range of speeds
flow into the treatment plant was _RARE_ and continuously recorded on 24-hr. _RARE_
sewage was introduced directly under the _RARE_ aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the _RARE_ tank contents
was collected through two _RARE_ and _RARE_ to the Blue River through a surface drainage ditch
samples were collected at weekly intervals
retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent
would make any changes more readily _RARE_ than daily samples
samples were normally collected over a _RARE_ period , but an occasional 24-hr. composite was made
the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the _RARE_ composite samples with 24-hr. operations
indicated that the organic load during the _RARE_ _RARE_ was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr. organic load
were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions
made to take the _RARE_ samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a _RARE_ composite sample
24-hr. composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical
operations The BOD of the _RARE_ to the pilot plant varied between _RARE_ and _RARE_ mg/l with an average of _RARE_ Aj
equivalent to _RARE_ _RARE_ on a 24-hr. basis
of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a _RARE_
in the effluent averaged _RARE_ mg/l , a _RARE_ reduction over the 24-hr. period
the data in Table 1 , shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent Aj
of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted
the aerator to _RARE_ , straining the drive belts
of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage
loading on the unit averaged _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ or about 2 _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ capacity
say , the organic load was very low on a _RARE_ basis , but was _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ on a surface loading basis
that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded _RARE_ _RARE_ system
rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1
spring _RARE_ the flow rose rapidly due to _RARE_ in open _RARE_
_RARE_ , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced
period in the aerated lagoon ranged from _RARE_ to _RARE_ days , averaging _RARE_ days
amount of _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem
were not readily _RARE_ by the bacteria in the _RARE_ unit and tended to _RARE_ on the surface
device at the effluent _RARE_ prevented loss of most of these light solids
_RARE_ suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mg/l while _RARE_ averaged _RARE_ mg/l _RARE_ suspended solids
_RARE_ age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be _RARE_ days
_RARE_ rate in the mixed liquor averaged _RARE_ _RARE_ during the first four months of this study
aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand
in oxygen _RARE_ rates from _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to _RARE_ of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds
that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active _RARE_ solids with the heavier , less active solids settling out
solids _RARE_ in the effluent were found to be the major source of the Aj
the suspended solids by a _RARE_ filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mg/l Aj
in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 Aj
BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by _RARE_ since the only dilution was surface _RARE_ which was very low during this study
_RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by _RARE_ and _RARE_ for the various types of protozoa
found that the aerated lagoon was an _RARE_ _RARE_ system rather than an oxidation pond
time were algae found in the mixed liquor
formed typical _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
particles were all small as the heavier _RARE_ settled out
the _RARE_ protozoa _RARE_ , but they soon gave way to the free swimming _RARE_ protozoa
temperature decreased , the number of free swimming _RARE_ protozoa decreased
protozoa activity existed below _RARE_
temperature reached _RARE_ all _RARE_ activity _RARE_ ; ; but as the temperature rose , the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly
were stalked _RARE_ found in the mixed liquor
of free swimming _RARE_ protozoa is _RARE_ of a high _RARE_ population
One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator
were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen _RARE_ rates
given in Table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator
oxygen in the _RARE_ unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961
cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a _RARE_ platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water
resistance to the rotor _RARE_ the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity
approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and _RARE_ , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen
of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate
the tests were conducted with a _RARE_ cover to _RARE_ an ice cover
of oxygen transfer at _RARE_ / _RARE_ dissolved oxygen concentration and _RARE_ for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3
rate of oxygen transfer at _RARE_ mg/l dissolved oxygen was calculated as _RARE_ _RARE_ at a maximum rate of _RARE_ Aj
power requirements indicated 2 lb. oxygen transfer / _RARE_ / _RARE_
cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface
During this study _RARE_ conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice _RARE_
this study ended _RARE_ conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium _RARE_
of the oxidation pond in a _RARE_ residential area makes odor _RARE_ a sensitive problem for the _RARE_
concentration in the _RARE_ raw sewage ranged from _RARE_ to _RARE_ mg/l of BOD with an average of _RARE_ Aj
data are given in Table 4
24-hr. composite sample had a BOD of _RARE_ mg/l , indicating a typical domestic sewage
sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged _RARE_ _RARE_ , giving a retention period of 42 days
loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb. BOD / day / _RARE_
BOD averaged 34 mg/l , a little lower than that of the study at _RARE_ indicated for a loading of 60 lb. Aj
of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of _RARE_ mg. / _RARE_
of the effluent showed that minimum BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather
algae began to build up again , the effluent BOD rose
two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent _RARE_ in the effluent were 18 and 16 Aj
the three main categories of _RARE_ warfare operations are defense of _RARE_ , defense of naval forces , and area defense
category _RARE_ the others in _RARE_ operations and near _RARE_ and bases
these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations
have been used to provide defense _RARE_ around naval and _RARE_ ship _RARE_ , air to furnish area _RARE_ , and mines for protection of limited areas
shore installations are new elements
now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in _RARE_ enemy access to ocean areas
offer possibilities for area detection
is being _RARE_ against submarine targets
element , not always considered , is intelligence
operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment
presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies ; ; intelligence on the environment will come from the recently _RARE_ program in _RARE_
_RARE_ development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered _RARE_ but in combination and as being mutually supporting
an over-all concept _RARE_ on submarine defense has not always been _RARE_
single elements tend to _RARE_ _RARE_ of that element without determining if it is justified , and the element with the most enthusiastic and _RARE_ _RARE_ has assumed the greatest importance
air , surface , and submarine elements _RARE_ the mine , fixed installations , and intelligence
sought more and more of what they have
to _RARE_ for elimination of the necessity for the others
despite _RARE_ experience _RARE_ that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting
the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed
stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense , one which would provide positions of relative importance to _RARE_ elements based on _RARE_ _RARE_
enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be _RARE_ to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective
concept would have other advantages
allow presentation to the public of a unified approach
problem is presented _RARE_ and sometimes _RARE_
element is _RARE_ progress , another is _RARE_ its problems
can only be confusion in the public mind
concept can serve as a guide to _RARE_ and , if public support is gained , will command _RARE_ support
criticism of the _RARE_ _RARE_ effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and _RARE_
, industry _RARE_ its own areas
, coupled with the _RARE_ for which American industry is famous , is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas
concept will guide industry where available _RARE_ and facilities will yield greatest dividends
a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for _RARE_ of the _RARE_ efforts , for a logical presentation to the public , for industry's guidance , and as a basis for a program to the Congress
in an over-all concept That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of _RARE_ warfare
the _RARE_ of submarines in the world , divided between her various _RARE_
also in _RARE_ and others are on loan to _RARE_
which may _RARE_ or _RARE_ become Communist can furnish bases
areas can be assumed , but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions
come from almost any direction against many locations
then , the first principle of the plan must be that it is not _RARE_ oriented toward any geographical area
often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building , at bases , in transit , and on station
the _RARE_ building and base complex , however , requires _RARE_ on enemy territory , which is possible only in event of _RARE_ _RARE_
or on station , it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an _RARE_ act
are _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage
second principle of the plan must be that , while providing for _RARE_ _RARE_ , its effectiveness is not dependent on general war
does not involve _RARE_ between large _RARE_ forces , with the decision a result of a single battle
a war of _RARE_ , of single actions , of an exchange of losses
must result in our ending up with some effective units
having _RARE_ units of some elements -- especially submarines -- than the _RARE_ , our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs , so that the exchange will be in our favor
the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types , unless at an assured favorable exchange rate
has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War 2
has increased , it operates at increasingly greater depths , its _RARE_ _RARE_ is becoming _RARE_ , and it will become even more silent
developments will probably be in _RARE_
can gradually be expected to replace the _RARE_
_RARE_ increase , weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these _RARE_
the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the _RARE_
can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense
support the others , but all have limitations
of one element can be _RARE_ for by a capability of another
in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements
the _RARE_ fifth principle must be that it _RARE_ on the capabilities of all elements in combination
submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces
be _RARE_ and current fiscal policies make this an _RARE_ solution
aircraft procurement , and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything
any measures taken in _RARE_ which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when _RARE_ occur
the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements
is constantly changing ; ; what was new yesterday is _RARE_ today
principle of the plan is _RARE_ ; ; it must be flexible enough to allow for technological _RARE_ , scientific progress , and changes in world conditions
in _RARE_ operations To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated , the mission has been stated , broad principles _RARE_ its content laid down , and the supporting elements listed
these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated
coverage will accomplish all other tasks
because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required , the plan should provide for expanding area coverage
must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented _RARE_
the system giving area coverage ( if such coverage is less than world wide ) must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile
area coverage appears fairly remote , the requirement can be _RARE_ in mind while considering the elements : air , surface , _RARE_ , fixed installations , mines , and intelligence
arranged approximately in the order of the _RARE_ of their _RARE_ but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result
as used _RARE_ , will include information on possible _RARE_ and on the environment which can affect operations
be referred to as operational intelligence and _RARE_ intelligence
defense these must have maximum stress
intelligence can _RARE_ sound planning , greatly reduce force requirements , and increase _RARE_ effectiveness
is just as important
presently _RARE_ with the target
of the science of _RARE_ can bring the environment to our side , resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and _RARE_ , a decrease in enemy capabilities , and the development of methods of _RARE_ on the environment
improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and , as it supports all other elements , rates a top priority
is important , but of equal importance is its translation into _RARE_ form
is needed to translate the results of _RARE_ research into _RARE_ and operating instructions
problem on a statistical basis is _RARE_ , because the _RARE_ has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions , but under the conditions most _RARE_ to him
the _RARE_ _RARE_ must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions , in the area , at the time of encounter
must be used to maximum advantage then
wind , oxygen content , depth , bottom character , and animal life are the chief _RARE_ variables
be others
sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature , because more of the variables would be _RARE_
must eventually be measured _RARE_ as well as _RARE_
_RARE_ water conditions is encouraging , but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information
effort is needed to make _RARE_ data useful on the spot
has in the past been directed against surface targets
nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater _RARE_
being increasingly oriented against submarine targets
still considered to be for use in restricted waters , however , and targets must come within a few yards of them
to be recognized as a major element in _RARE_ warfare employment , extended to deep water , and have their effective area per unit increased
be used to deny access to great areas ; ; they are difficult to counter , cost little to maintain until required , and can be put into place quickly
attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package
will reduce force requirements
, effective mine barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the _RARE_ _RARE_ from Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for _RARE_ defense , _RARE_ patrol , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ control , and mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico
systems , covering all passage into the _RARE_ , would free the _RARE_ and the Gulf of Mexico from the previously listed requirements
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and possibly the entire _RARE_ of the United States are not impossible
defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open _RARE_ with consequent increase in the probability of success
inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is _RARE_ any of the other elements
are increasingly _RARE_ as the problem of area defense _RARE_
are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military _RARE_
_RARE_ submarines over wide areas are attractive , although they can be only `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
are required to _RARE_ and attack detected targets , since the systems are not capable of _RARE_ a target
are expensive and are oriented _RARE_
over-all _RARE_ concept , dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with _RARE_ capabilities
_RARE_ should be made until a model _RARE_ has been proved and its maximum capability determined
, _RARE_ for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a _RARE_ mobile system
will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems
has become increasingly attractive as an _RARE_ weapon system
in its _RARE_ environment , and any advantage gained _RARE_ by the target is shared by the _RARE_
submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being _RARE_
( 1 , and 2 ) ) of _RARE_ acid ( _RARE_ ) which act as _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ by _RARE_ bacteria are _RARE_ from Aj
_RARE_ of _RARE_ are incorporated directly into _RARE_ 2 ( ( as shown with both _RARE_ and _RARE_ Af )
the _RARE_ carbon atoms arise from Aj
_RARE_ of _RARE_ 1 ( ( a product of mild acid _RARE_ of 2 ) arise from Aj
, isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates _RARE_ synthesis of this _RARE_
_RARE_ of _RARE_ 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the compound and _RARE_ two _RARE_ _RARE_
has been obtained in _RARE_ form as a _RARE_ salt and free base
_RARE_ indicates that the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ 1 ) ) is _RARE_ at a secondary _RARE_ bond
H. _RARE_ ; ; chemical studies are being _RARE_ with the cooperation of _RARE_ _RARE_
on _RARE_ -- Research on _RARE_ in _RARE_ sera was continued
the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma _RARE_ to rare earth ions
of the _RARE_ by very low concentrations of _RARE_ _RARE_ is probably the strongest known biological effect of rare earth _RARE_
ions have been found to protect plasma _RARE_ against _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_
can be related to the structure of this _RARE_
of serum and red blood cell _RARE_ was also established
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ was studied in _RARE_ sera , and it was found that it is _RARE_ by albumin ( or a factor attached to it ) in addition to _RARE_
can distinguish the two activities
the acceleration of human plasma _RARE_ were carried further
G. _RARE_ , L. E. _RARE_ , C. D. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ studies on modified _RARE_ proteins -- _RARE_ and _RARE_ methods were used to demonstrate the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ acid
_RARE_ _RARE_ ) A method was _RARE_ for _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ( _RARE_ )
observed that _RARE_ _RARE_ are the same diameter ( 15 _RARE_ ) but much longer ( up to several _RARE_ ) than _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ also was shown to _RARE_ a _RARE_ thermal phase transformation
_RARE_ _RARE_ , M. D. _RARE_ ) studies on _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- This investigation involved several aspects
, an active _RARE_ _RARE_ , was purified by _RARE_ in organic _RARE_ and repeated column chromatography ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ and paper chromatography were used in preliminary structural studies ; ; _RARE_ effects in _RARE_ on isolated _RARE_ _RARE_ and in _RARE_ on blood pressure were _RARE_ ; ; special equipment required for _RARE_ _RARE_ and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles under various conditions was developed by the _RARE_ Section ( _RARE_ _RARE_ , W. C. _RARE_ , J. F. _RARE_ ) ; ; and enzymes which terminate the action of _RARE_ such as _RARE_ and perhaps _RARE_ _RARE_ were studied
in progress to develop _RARE_ _RARE_ techniques for _RARE_ these enzymes and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions
G. _RARE_ , C. D. _RARE_ , A. G. _RARE_ , W. B. _RARE_ , E. M. _RARE_ ) seed proteins -- In a _RARE_ study of seed proteins , the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ nut have been investigated
to the known principal _RARE_ , _RARE_ , three other _RARE_ distinct components have been observed
protein of quite low molecular weight ( _RARE_ 10,000 ) has also been found in this system and partly characterized
F. _RARE_ , H. J. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ mechanics and _RARE_ theory of _RARE_ fluids -- On the basis of a _RARE_ assumption in function space , it is possible to prove that , for materials having the property that the stress is given by a functional of the history of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the classical theory of _RARE_ _RARE_ is valid when the _RARE_ has been _RARE_ for all times in the past
the _RARE_ assumption , it has been possible to derive second and higher order theories of _RARE_
_RARE_ theory , one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the _RARE_ stress _RARE_ function
D. _RARE_ with Walter _RARE_ , Department of _RARE_ , _RARE_ Institute of _RARE_ ) _RARE_ measurements -- An extensive series of measurements was made on a _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ _RARE_ instrument using forced _RARE_ _RARE_ , free _RARE_ , and creep measurements over the temperature range of Af to _RARE_
as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ valid for many _RARE_ systems did not hold here
possible , however , to _RARE_ the _RARE_ into a sum of a _RARE_ component and two _RARE_ mechanisms , each compatible with the _RARE_ _RARE_ principle and with a consistent set of _RARE_ _RARE_ factors
_RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ ) _RARE_ trace elements in _RARE_ , meteorites , and related materials -- The results of _RARE_ of _RARE_ ( natural glasses of unknown origin ) for _RARE_ and germanium have shown that these glasses are probably produced from _RARE_ ( or less likely from lunar ) matter by impact of a _RARE_ body
/ germanium ratio is higher than that for ordinary _RARE_ , _RARE_ , or _RARE_ matter as a result of selective _RARE_ of the components of the _RARE_
is less _RARE_ than _RARE_ ( the main _RARE_ of _RARE_ ) and germanium _RARE_ is more _RARE_
_RARE_ from _RARE_ ) give the appearance of a second melting
with this conclusion a higher trace _RARE_ content was found in the portion ( _RARE_ ) that has _RARE_ a second melting
fractions of _RARE_ meteorites show _RARE_ / germanium ratios similar to those of _RARE_ because they too have _RARE_ melting at some point in their _RARE_
_RARE_ , another natural glass , is composed of nearly pure _RARE_ and has the same trace germanium content as _RARE_ in the area
content , however , has been _RARE_ _RARE_
is probably formed from _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ or _RARE_ impact
with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large _RARE_ explosion _RARE_ may nevertheless _RARE_ only small quantities of material
the impact energy is spent in _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ follows melting , impact glasses may result
contain metallic _RARE_
not containing _RARE_ _RARE_ may have been produced by _RARE_ meteorites or _RARE_
have ever been recovered from _RARE_ _RARE_ , and recent _RARE_ containing impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception of _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , Western _RARE_ _RARE_
contains impact glass with no metallic _RARE_ and no meteoritic material has been recovered
J. _RARE_ , John _RARE_ ) inorganic chemistry Preparation of a coordination compound is often accomplished by the simple method of _RARE_ a metal salt with a _RARE_ in a suitable _RARE_ such as an alcohol
this general principle , a great number of complex compounds of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , with _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years
_RARE_ , E. M. _RARE_ , J. W. _RARE_ ) In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary , decomposition of _RARE_ alcohol and coordination of its _RARE_ to the metal were not considered , following the above _RARE_ assumption in _RARE_ coordination chemistry
with _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ as _RARE_ , however , has given evidence that _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ may be readily formed by reaction with alcohol in some of these systems
the previously reported compounds have thus been _RARE_ and a series of new _RARE_ and _RARE_ compounds discovered , the more representative examples being Af , Af , Af , Af and Af ( Af )
_RARE_ formed by transition _RARE_ with primary and secondary _RARE_ and _RARE_ are being investigated ( R. G. _RARE_ )
is directed towards the _RARE_ of these _RARE_ with metal _RARE_ to form substituted _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_
past year , these _RARE_ have yielded some unusual _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ ( 2 ) and some interesting _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ ( 2 ) ( see figure ) , as well as new compounds of the well-known type Af
, properties , and reactions of these compounds are being studied
study _RARE_ aluminum _RARE_ and related species , prepared _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ , are being characterized and investigated _RARE_ in the _RARE_ region with a view to identification and _RARE_ _RARE_ of the phases formed under varying _RARE_ conditions
A. _RARE_ , N. L. _RARE_ ) structure and properties of _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ -- The theory of _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ has been developed on a more general basis and the equations of state relating variables of pressure , volume , temperature , stress and strain have been precisely _RARE_
has been treated in detail
_RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ of volume and strain , _RARE_ of pressure and strain , and _RARE_ of pressure and length have been _RARE_
accompanying _RARE_ and the simultaneously developed _RARE_ of _RARE_ have been related to the _RARE_
of these theoretical studies , a more precise _RARE_ of the effects of _RARE_ in network structure is sought
J. _RARE_ , C. A. J. _RARE_ ) chain _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ -- Recent theoretical work to _RARE_ the dimensions of _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ and _RARE_ has been extended to include more general types of _RARE_
_RARE_ distance of the _RARE_ chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with values _RARE_ from viscosity data
are being extended to different _RARE_ to increase our knowledge about the _RARE_ to rotation around chain bonds
A. J. _RARE_ , A. A. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ in _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- The _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ Af units _RARE_ with a minor percentage of Af is limited by the _RARE_ of the crystal _RARE_ characteristic of the former to _RARE_ the bulky side group of the latter
_RARE_ of the former are _RARE_ for formation of _RARE_
the lengths of these _RARE_ _RARE_ the stability of the _RARE_ short _RARE_ which can be formed , and this is reflected in a broadening of the melting range
_RARE_ , J. B. Jackson , P. J. _RARE_ ) _RARE_ _RARE_ melting studies on this system ( M. J. _RARE_ ) permit quantitative _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ by reduced _RARE_ length
_RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ is necessarily dependent on the same factor
the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations in the latter field
muscle -- _RARE_ muscle , in the presence of the physiological agent ( _RARE_ ) responsible for _RARE_ energy to the _RARE_ active proteins of muscle , has been shown to _RARE_ a contraction which is highly sensitive both to temperature and to _RARE_ composition in _RARE_ of _RARE_ and water
out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are _RARE_ to an interval of several degrees _RARE_ and to a concentration range of only several per cent
therefore _RARE_ of the character of a phase transition
appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction , its presence and _RARE_ _RARE_ of it by the muscle protein _RARE_ are not the only criteria for contraction
A. J. _RARE_ , P. J. _RARE_ ) anionic _RARE_ -- One of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques is the synthesis of _RARE_ of extremely narrow molecular weight distribution
process for the preparation of nearly _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ molecular weight has been developed
of such products is not new , but the systems _RARE_ employed in _RARE_ have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high _RARE_
new process impurities present in the _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) , the _RARE_ , and in the reaction system which would cause _RARE_ of propagation centers , are rendered _RARE_ prior to polymerization by _RARE_ addition of _RARE_ , a mixture of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , at a temperature low enough to _RARE_ chain growth
of the _RARE_ step , additional _RARE_ appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added , and the system is then warmed to the polymerization temperature , at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion
of the molecular weights was found to be within _RARE_ for the _RARE_ prepared , with Af ratios less than _RARE_
observations with _RARE_ , no apparent change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable periods of time in _RARE_ as _RARE_
In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to _RARE_ and identify chemical substances

Force Office of _RARE_ Research has provided financial assistance in the early stages of the _RARE_ program
All _RARE_ substances and other _RARE_ materials
The aim is to collect a very broad range of physical , chemical , _RARE_ , and structural data for crystals on an _RARE_ scale and to seek all possible useful and revealing _RARE_ of properties with internal structure
data : The first stage of operation has centered on the literature _RARE_ of critical or _RARE_ _RARE_ such as the Barker _RARE_
primary literature will follow
will be available to the _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ groups and individuals
_RARE_ evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this project

classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , chemical treatment , _RARE_ , refrigeration , and freezing
objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between _RARE_ or _RARE_ , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of _RARE_ or production to areas of consumption
years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival
more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations , _RARE_ techniques have sought also to bring variety , peak _RARE_ , and optimum taste and _RARE_ in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer
development of nuclear technology , _RARE_ materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying _RARE_ radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world
hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon _RARE_
, however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for _RARE_ spoilage losses and for _RARE_ some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without _RARE_ heat or _RARE_ with their attendant taste _RARE_
for the spoilage of foods The chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh _RARE_ are ( 1 ) microorganisms such as bacteria , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , ( 2 ) enzymes , ( 3 ) insects , ( 4 ) _RARE_ , and ( 5 ) chemical reactions
often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods
concern is the growth of bacteria such as _RARE_ _RARE_ which _RARE_ _RARE_ products
in stored food produces changes which can _RARE_ affect the appearance of food or its palatability
chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment , as in _RARE_ of the walls of metal _RARE_ or the reaction of _RARE_ with oxygen in the air to produce _RARE_
a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and similar root _RARE_
is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain
of _RARE_ organisms such as _RARE_ _RARE_ in pork _RARE_ another factor which must be dealt with in food processing
the storage of food for long periods of time , a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and _RARE_ of _RARE_ action
`` _RARE_ '' applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms
in this manner and protected from _RARE_ by _RARE_ methods of _RARE_ and _RARE_ presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration
of `` _RARE_ '' involves _RARE_ and less prolonged heat treatment which _RARE_ the destruction of most , but not all , of the microorganisms
thermal treatment as by _RARE_ or _RARE_ serves to _RARE_ enzymes
of _RARE_ radiation _RARE_ radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or , at lower doses , can inhibit their action
a means of _RARE_ insects in stored grain products as well as certain _RARE_ organisms present in meats
enzymes is also possible , although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 _RARE_ or more
_RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , colors , and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude , the _RARE_ of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional _RARE_ methods of _RARE_
not _RARE_ the chemical spoilage of food
, however , inhibit the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and other root _RARE_
doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following _RARE_ : 1
, to destroy all organisms for long-term preservation -- about _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ foods of low salt content

, to partially destroy microorganisms ; ; results vary with types of food , storage conditions , and objectives of treatment -- commonly of the order of _RARE_ _RARE_ but up to about _RARE_ Aj

of insects -- about _RARE_ Aj

the _RARE_ of root _RARE_ -- _RARE_ to 10,000 Aj
with _RARE_ radiation leads to some _RARE_ side effects , particularly at the higher radiation _RARE_
respect , the general palatability and individual acceptance of most _RARE_ foods has , to date , been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods
of foods are quite _RARE_ as _RARE_ taste and palatability , however , at _RARE_ substantially less than _RARE_ levels
the _RARE_ value of _RARE_ foods apparently _RARE_ little , if any , change , although some of the _RARE_ _RARE_ are affected by _RARE_ doses
For irradiation of food , the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation , and X-ray , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ electron radiation are suitable
availability and economic considerations , each has certain practical advantages ; ; for example , _RARE_ _RARE_ give deeper _RARE_ but cannot be focused or _RARE_ , whereas _RARE_ electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be _RARE_
a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate , load factor , _RARE_ , convenience , safety , and most important , costs
_RARE_ useful sources of _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ sources , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ products , or a _RARE_ irradiation loop system using a material such as an _RARE_ salt have received most attention for _RARE_ systems
various particle _RARE_ , the _RARE_ De _RARE_ machines , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and linear _RARE_ are the principal ones available for commercial use
the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of _RARE_ processes
costs of radiation energy from machine and _RARE_ sources range from $1 to _RARE_ per Aj
for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per _RARE_ for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per _RARE_ for process steam
therefore , is at an initial cost _RARE_ even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization or _RARE_
the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the future
been estimated that for applications on a _RARE_ scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per _RARE_ for _RARE_ _RARE_ or for _RARE_ radiation generated in a _RARE_ core
_RARE_ in the cost of _RARE_ radiation are foreseen
, however , appear highly _RARE_ and the _RARE_ involved are far beyond those foreseen for _RARE_ facilities
activities are _RARE_ and the areas of production and _RARE_ of many foods are widely scattered _RARE_ , and because of the high cost of _RARE_ bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location , the use of large central processing stations , where _RARE_ radiation facilities approaching the _RARE_ range might be utilized , is _RARE_ _RARE_
of irradiation preservation of foods The objective of complete _RARE_ of foods is to produce a _RARE_ and _RARE_ product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time
in _RARE_ _RARE_ in the military services
, providing _RARE_ food under battle or emergency conditions is a _RARE_ consideration
completely _RARE_ foods capable of being stored without refrigeration , preferably items already cooked and ready to eat
value , variety , palatability , and _RARE_ appearance are important for reasons of morale
rear stations , which require cooking , but no refrigeration , are also of interest
interest are meats
which produces _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ changes in food products , has potential usefulness in _RARE_ the keeping qualities of fresh and _RARE_ food items
food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak _RARE_ and palatability
is chiefly in this type of treatment , as is military interest under _RARE_ conditions
status of food preservation by _RARE_ radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs
radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation
, the one meat showing favorable results at _RARE_ doses is pork
interest to the military services is the demonstration that _RARE_ pork , after _RARE_ , is superior in palatability to available _RARE_ pork products
beef have been largely _RARE_ because of the development of _RARE_
objective of the Army _RARE_ Corps program is to find the reasons for _RARE_ low palatability and means of _RARE_ it , since it is a major and desirable _RARE_ item
_RARE_ heat treatment is needed to _RARE_ enzymes before _RARE_ , treated fresh meats have the appearance of _RARE_ or _RARE_ meat
a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats , but problems of commercial _RARE_ remain
doses of from _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ can extend the shelf life ( at 35 F ) of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks
the problem of consumer _RARE_ remains
_RARE_ process _RARE_ the treated beef and liquid _RARE_ in _RARE_ cuts
_RARE_ in the absence of oxygen _RARE_ an _RARE_ pink color
and _RARE_ are _RARE_ at _RARE_ doses , the meat becomes _RARE_ , the fat becomes _RARE_ , and , again , _RARE_ changes in color occur
such as fresh pork _RARE_ and _RARE_ have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration , and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities
a major problem here is one of scale of processing ; ; ground meats are usually prepared from _RARE_ meats at the local level , whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities
of color change by _RARE_ and liquid _RARE_ within the package are the same as for solid cuts
items containing meat portions , as in `` frozen dinners '' might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization
potential advantage would be that the finished product could be _RARE_ and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen
item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type
for _RARE_ meats are by _RARE_ and freezing
_RARE_ meat are in the range of _RARE_ to 5 cents per pound ; ; costs of freezing are in the area of 2 to _RARE_ cents per pound
on page 10 shows costs of _RARE_ and freezing meat , and estimated costs for irradiation under certain assumed conditions
conditions of comparison , it will be noted that : ( 1 ) _RARE_ ( at 3 _RARE_ ) is more expensive than _RARE_ , particularly for the _RARE_ source
) _RARE_ by either the electron _RARE_ or _RARE_ source is in the range of freezing costs
) _RARE_ using the _RARE_ source is more expensive than use of an electron _RARE_
of irradiation tests with _RARE_ have been quite successful
doses , good palatability results , with a minimum of changes in appearance , taste , and odor
also been successful , and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under _RARE_ storage as compared with about 10 days for the _RARE_ product
and odor are retained by the _RARE_ and _RARE_ chicken
radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed , however , for two reasons : ( 1 ) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved _RARE_ and _RARE_ practices , and ( 2 ) treatment by _RARE_ , a measure already approved by the Federal _RARE_ and _RARE_ Administration , serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about _RARE_ cents per pound
_RARE_ products are extremely _RARE_
has served to extend the storage life of these products , substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the _RARE_ could be served adequately
it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible
is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , _RARE_ _RARE_ knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating
required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic _RARE_ , against distance of removal
removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential _RARE_ pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness
too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut
of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to _RARE_ measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such _RARE_ as iron and other _RARE_ , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces
of _RARE_ on _RARE_ can also readily be carried out
have been found to compare _RARE_ with _RARE_ knife scratching tests
method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and _RARE_ numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time
_RARE_ coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle , a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating
_RARE_ a cutting ( or _RARE_ ) phenomenon is often encountered
coating becomes _RARE_ , the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure
coating becomes still _RARE_ , a peeling type failure finally can occur
appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 , which are single frame _RARE_ of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process
be seen from Fig. 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating
forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface
of Figs. 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is _RARE_ by failure in a region at , or close to , the _RARE_ between coating and substrate
force required to remove the coatings is plotted against film thickness , a graph as illustrated _RARE_ in Fig. 5 may _RARE_ result
H is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and T is the film thickness
be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal
it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response , while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature
be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness
interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case
, are the factors that contribute to these phenomena
the `` practical _RARE_ '' of a coating as _RARE_ by a knife method change , initially increasing rather rapidly and then _RARE_ _RARE_ to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness
of cohesive failure The cutting ( or _RARE_ ) removal process has been previously described
found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure
of the removal process are shown _RARE_ in Fig. 6
forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane , which makes an angle **yf with the substrate
and reaction forces are R and Af , respectively , and are equal and opposite in direction
other force vectors are derived from these
the force required to cut a coating of thickness T from the substrate
the shear force along the shear plane ; ; Af and Af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife , respectively ; ; Af is the normal _RARE_ force acting on the shear plane ; ; Af is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces , and P is the normal force acting on the face of the knife
the rake angle of the knife ; ; **yf is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate ; ; _RARE_ is the friction angle ; ; and _RARE_ is the angle the _RARE_ make with the plane of the substrate
of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle **yc and the friction angle _RARE_ determine the vector direction Af of the force _RARE_ R and Af
both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process
difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of R directly
practice , the values most readily _RARE_ to measurement are the cutting force Af and the shear angle Aj
values and the rake angle **yc are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships
defined by the geometry of the knife ; ; **yf can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate ; ; Af is _RARE_ determined
6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is Af where **yl is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material , _RARE_ is the width of the removed coating and T is its thickness
cutting force , Af , is plotted against film thickness , a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope Af
in the actual assessment of the cutting force by _RARE_ methods for any thickness of coating a number of _RARE_ effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by _RARE_ ( 1 )
One of these is the fact that the knife employed , no matter how well _RARE_ , will have a slightly rounded cutting edge
that **yc , the rake angle , is no longer a constant to zero film thickness
of this _RARE_ is , in the case of the _RARE_ knife employed in the Hesiometer , determined by the grain sizes of the polished _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ crystals _RARE_ together in the knife body and is in the order of _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_
vector concept of Fig. 6 can readily be applied to this condition also
rake angle Af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller ( or even negative ) when compared to the value of **yc for the major portion of the knife , a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result
to the relationship : Af , where Af is the _RARE_ at zero thickness of the _RARE_ of the slope indicated in _RARE_ ( 1 ) , Af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the _RARE_ off of the knife tip , Af is a straight line first approximation of this _RARE_ , and the other symbols are equivalent to those of _RARE_ ( 1 )
be seen that Af is a constant , and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife
the knife , the higher is the value of Af
of a hard , _RARE_ knife material like the _RARE_ employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent
would _RARE_ very rapidly , making the value of Af _RARE_
cases of very soft _RARE_ this value may even change during the course of a measurement
A second factor which _RARE_ into the practical measurement of the _RARE_ determined cutting force is the _RARE_ resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate
not a constant value like Af , but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the _RARE_ R and Af of Fig. 6
conditions of cutting the chip _RARE_ a thrust Af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of Af
friction force , Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness
of Af can readily be _RARE_ by determining the _RARE_ force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external _RARE_
line relationship is usually observed in a plot of Af against load L , having slope _RARE_ , and Af
load L , under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af , it can be seen that Af
force , H , in cutting removal of coatings from their _RARE_ consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating , Af , that due to the _RARE_ of the knife , Af , and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate , Af , or Af
two forces are directly _RARE_ and depend upon film thickness , whereas Af is independent of these two and is a constant for a given _RARE_ combination
relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig. 7 and their sum can be seen to _RARE_ in form with practical measurements made with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig. 5 for the cutting mechanism
of cohesive failure Although a large number of coatings systems , particularly at low _RARE_ fail _RARE_ by the cutting mechanism , frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place
a _RARE_ , dynamic type failure encountered with very _RARE_ coatings _RARE_ or very highly _RARE_ films
shown in the _RARE_ of Fig. 8
difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the _RARE_ mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ occurs along the shear plane
mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied _RARE_ by Merchant for metal cutting , and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings
high speed movies made of this type of failure , the sequence of relationships as _RARE_ illustrated in Fig. 9 could be observed
first picture ( _RARE_ ) the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation
next , the shear plane angle is high , and extends to the inclined work surface
advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases
_RARE_ occurs along the shear plane ( _RARE_ ) , and the cycle _RARE_ itself
found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the _RARE_ chip formation provided the proper values of _RARE_ shear angle and _RARE_ chip thickness or _RARE_ area are used
if the shear angle **yf is replaced by the _RARE_ angle Af , the relationships as described in _RARE_ ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) will directly apply
mechanism Under equilibrium cutting conditions , the chip _RARE_ a force Af against the coating and an equal opposite force Af against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig. 6
rake angle **yc of the knife is high enough and the friction angle _RARE_ between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for Af , the resultant vector R will lie above the plane of the substrate
a few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight
, as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955
year's volume probably _RARE_ 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of _RARE_ million lb. by _RARE_
the other foamed plastics , particularly the _RARE_ , show similar growth potential
are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated
issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an _RARE_ foam with outstanding _RARE_ and impact strength ; ; another reports that a _RARE_ _RARE_ , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated
following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing
be well to point out , however , some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved
foams , for example , there has been a definite trend toward the _RARE_ materials ( which are now available in _RARE_ rigid foam systems ) and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding
also seem to be _RARE_ on _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the _RARE_ building markets
as an _RARE_ is also coming in for a good deal of attention
outstanding example , _RARE_ _RARE_ found that by _RARE_ to urethane foam _RARE_ , they could increase the storage capacity of gas _RARE_ to make them competitive with electric models
has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams , including _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and molding ( see article , p. _RARE_ for details )
meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment _RARE_ , new _RARE_ and new methods of _RARE_ foam to a substrate have been developed
for automatic molding of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ have helped _RARE_ that particular material into a number of new consumer applications , including _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , flower _RARE_ , and _RARE_ swimming _RARE_
_RARE_ areas which contributed to _RARE_ _RARE_ growth during the year were _RARE_ ( _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ complicated _RARE_ units ) and _RARE_ building panels
_RARE_ film or sheet -- claimed to be competitive _RARE_ with paper -- also showed much potential , particularly for _RARE_
for building utility shelters that consist of _RARE_ paper _RARE_ and rigid _RARE_ foam _RARE_ also aroused interest in the construction field
foam , the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material ( for details , see P. _RARE_ )
hand '' , a more _RARE_ feel , and better _RARE_ properties were claimed to be the result
also saw possibilities in using the technique for _RARE_ or molding _RARE_ products with a slight _RARE_ core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent
in additional information on foams are referred to the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ Data section and to the list of references which appears below
Since the _RARE_ _RARE_ , when urethane foam first made its appearance in the American market , growth has been little short of fantastic
are that production _RARE_ the _RARE_ mark in 1960 ( 85 to _RARE_ million lb. for flexible , 10 or 11 million lb. for rigid ) ; ; by _RARE_ , production may range from 200 to _RARE_ million lb. for flexible and from _RARE_ to _RARE_ million lb. for rigid
that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations
, as just one example , can easily take millions of pounds ; ; foamed refrigerator _RARE_ is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer ; ; and use of the foam for garment _RARE_ is only now getting off the ground , with volume potential in the _RARE_
_RARE_ foams are , basically , reaction products of _RARE_ materials and _RARE_ ( usually _RARE_ _RARE_ )
be either one of two types -- carbon _RARE_ gas generated by the reaction of water on the _RARE_ or mechanical blowing through the use of a _RARE_ liquid such as a _RARE_ _RARE_
important factor in determining what properties the _RARE_ will have is quite naturally the type of _RARE_ compound that is used in its production
the main types used were various compositions of _RARE_
still in wide use today , particularly in _RARE_ formulations , for such applications as _RARE_ for _RARE_ structural panels , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ safety _RARE_ , arm rests , etc.
, _RARE_ -- again in varied compositions , molecular weights , and _RARE_ -- have come into use at first for the flexible foams , just lately for the _RARE_
_RARE_ are claimed to give flexible _RARE_ a _RARE_ action which is much desired in _RARE_
first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the _RARE_ _RARE_ method , today , thanks to new _RARE_ , they can be produced by a one-shot technique
possible that the polyether foams may soon be _RARE_ on a production basis in _RARE_ _RARE_ with more _RARE_ contours and with superior properties to _RARE_ foam
urethane foam is generally produced with _RARE_ acid _RARE_ ; ; the polyether group generally consists of foams produced with _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ modified with a _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ In the _RARE_ system , the _RARE_ and _RARE_ are mixed _RARE_ and no foaming occurs
can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of _RARE_ in solution
, the _RARE_ , _RARE_ or polyether _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other _RARE_ are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately
this means that _RARE_ processing equipment ( the mixture has good flowing characteristics ) and less external heat ( the foaming reaction is _RARE_ and _RARE_ internal heat ) are required in one-shot foaming , although , at the same time , the problems of controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are critical ones
commercial uses of urethane foams require _RARE_ between 2 and 30 lb. / _RARE_ ft. for rigid foams , between 1 and 3 lb. / _RARE_ ft. for flexible foams
figure _RARE_ with _RARE_ foam rubber at an average of _RARE_ lb. / _RARE_ ft. in commercial grades
: _RARE_ in Fig. 1 , p. _RARE_ , indicates how the ratio of _RARE_ strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased
curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example
the formula , this curve may be moved forward or backward along the _RARE_ to produce any desired _RARE_ strength / density ratio
and temperature resistance : In flexible urethane foams , we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the _RARE_ primary performance remains _RARE_ useful
resistance , this quality is usually related to specific properties , e.g. , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , etc.
is directly _RARE_ to the _RARE_ porous , _RARE_ construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the _RARE_ of minute bubbles which form its composition
or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers
factor , a term used to _RARE_ the rate of heat transmission through a material ( _RARE_ ft. of _RARE_ of thickness ) _RARE_ from _RARE_ to _RARE_ for flexible urethane foams and from _RARE_ to _RARE_ for rigid urethane foams , depending upon the formulation , density , cell size , and nature of blowing agents used
, , p. _RARE_ , shows a comparison of K factor ratings of a number of commercial _RARE_ materials in common use , including two different types of rigid urethane foam
: This term refers to the ability of a material to resist _RARE_ stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by _RARE_
urethane _RARE_ foams usually have stronger _RARE_ fatigue resistance , i.e. , the 12 lb. / _RARE_ ft. foam has 8 times the _RARE_ strength of the 3 lb. / _RARE_ ft. density
_RARE_ strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density , nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another
strength is an important factor , be sure that your urethane foam _RARE_ is aware of it
: This property refers to the greatest _RARE_ stress or tension a material can _RARE_ without tearing apart
_RARE_ strength of urethane foams , it has a direct relationship to formulation
_RARE_ strength is another of urethane _RARE_ strong features
, above , shows the _RARE_ properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change in _RARE_ strength during exposure to _RARE_ light
There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product
can be made into slab stock and cut to shape , it can be _RARE_ , it can be _RARE_ , it can be applied by spray guns , etc.
is still one of the most important forms of urethane _RARE_ in use today
the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more _RARE_ units , a variable _RARE_ , a _RARE_ carriage assembly , and , in many cases , a _RARE_ belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it _RARE_ into foam
are fed from tanks through a hose and into the _RARE_ at a _RARE_ rate
head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the _RARE_
takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure , the material can be cut into lengths as desired
been done in the way of ingenious _RARE_ to _RARE_ the slab stock into finished products
machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other _RARE_ in variable _RARE_ , dimensions , etc.
sheets can be combined to attain certain _RARE_ effects _RARE_ rather than _RARE_
is a _RARE_ which `` _RARE_ '' the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to _RARE_ continuous sheets up to 300 _RARE_ in length , down to _RARE_ _RARE_ thick
cost and ease of _RARE_ of the _RARE_ for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes , dimensions , and contours that can be _RARE_ to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case _RARE_ , materials handling _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ devices , and such _RARE_ as soap dishes , _RARE_ , head rests , _RARE_ supports , and gas _RARE_ covers
slab stock appeared first , it soon became apparent that for the production of _RARE_ with irregular shapes , _RARE_ contours , or rounded edges , the cutting of slab stock is a _RARE_ and _RARE_ process
_RARE_ to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market
molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material ( molding in open _RARE_ was more feasible )
for _RARE_ foams and even _RARE_ polyether foams were never fully achieved
generally resulted in parts _RARE_ more ( because of higher density ) than parts _RARE_ from _RARE_ foams
the gain from having no _RARE_ loss
, there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface , trouble with lack of _RARE_ strength in the rising foam , and problems of _RARE_
of one-shot polyether foam systems , _RARE_ by the development of new _RARE_ , helped to _RARE_ some of the problems of closed molding
are still many _RARE_ to be _RARE_ out , the technique is fast developing
_RARE_ systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured , _RARE_ , etc. , into a void where they foam up to fill the void
typical application -- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels -- an amount of foam mixture calculated to _RARE_ 10 to _RARE_ more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a _RARE_

rolls are loaded with 40 _RARE_
loading is possible but 40 _RARE_ is adequate
box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started
bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen
continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 _RARE_ or passes through the _RARE_ rolls
conclusion of the washing , 8 _RARE_ of water at _RARE_ ( _RARE_ ) are automatically _RARE_ from the _RARE_ _RARE_ to the washing _RARE_ , 4 _RARE_ to each tub
requires from 10 to 12 minutes
_RARE_ operation the volume in the _RARE_ gradually increases until _RARE_ from the main drain begins
point the _RARE_ are _RARE_ so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the _RARE_ mark on the drain gauge
of the _RARE_ water has passed from the _RARE_ to the _RARE_ the main _RARE_ are lowered to permit complete _RARE_ of the _RARE_
is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line
procedure _RARE_ _RARE_ in two stages , first by dilution until the time when the _RARE_ are separated and thereafter by displacement of the _RARE_ liquor by clean _RARE_ water , since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the _RARE_ passes directly to waste from the suds box _RARE_
of _RARE_ appears to produce maximum _RARE_ with minimum soil _RARE_
and classification _RARE_ may be made on either a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ basis as desired
instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning , whereas _RARE_ _RARE_ is necessary to measure _RARE_ removal

_RARE_ image _RARE_ is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a _RARE_ or recording instrument _RARE_ the limits of _RARE_
such situations are ( _RARE_ ) night _RARE_ , the recording of _RARE_ _RARE_ in live body tissues , special _RARE_ in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc.
image _RARE_ may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) _RARE_ single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) _RARE_ , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) _RARE_ intensifier based upon the `` _RARE_ '' principle , ( D ) _RARE_ secondary electron _RARE_ image intensifiers ( _RARE_ tubes ) , ( E ) _RARE_ of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope
stages by coupling lens systems is rather _RARE_ as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely
intensifiers are capable of achieving _RARE_ values ; ; they suffer , however , from an _RARE_ low resolution
based upon the _RARE_ principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned
the _RARE_ _RARE_ cycle _RARE_ the effective gain
have been constructed showing high gain and resolution
electrostatic focus , important for many applications , has not been realized for these devices
with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic _RARE_
the thin film _RARE_ appear to have a natural diameter _RARE_ wherever a _RARE_ support cannot be _RARE_
stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution
may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members
optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one
may be smaller , equal , or larger than unity
system _RARE_ generally from image plane _RARE_ leading to _RARE_ in the peripheral image region if a flat _RARE_ screen ( or _RARE_ _RARE_ ) is utilized , while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the _RARE_ , which is heavy and bulky
will be discussed later , peripheral _RARE_ can be improved on by _RARE_ curved fiber _RARE_
be noted , however , that the _RARE_ resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems
felt that _RARE_ _RARE_ ( and _RARE_ ) stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance in the future
we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes
efficiency and resolution of single stages , fiber _RARE_ , and finally of the composite tube will be computed
be shown _RARE_ that the high image _RARE_ obtainable with such a tube and contact _RARE_ permits the utilization of extremely low incident light levels
of device and _RARE_ noise , associated with such low input levels , will be described
theoretical considerations , _RARE_ details of a _RARE_ , _RARE_ X-ray image intensifier will be discussed
characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed
shall be reached that _RARE_ , _RARE_ tubes represent a _RARE_ and practical approach to _RARE_ image _RARE_
of a _RARE_ , _RARE_ image intensifier The tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now
optical system ( see fig. _RARE_ ) is based in principle on the _RARE_ action of _RARE_ spherical cathode and anode surfaces
( anode ) sphere is _RARE_ , _RARE_ into a cup , and _RARE_ by the phosphor screen
_RARE_ from a circular _RARE_ of the cathode sphere are focused by the positive lens action of the two _RARE_ _RARE_ , pass through the ( negative ) lens formed by the anode aperture , and _RARE_ upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ screen
_RARE_ _RARE_ permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the _RARE_ potential
potential _RARE_ the gain , G , and magnification , M , of the stage
photocathode and the image plane of such an _RARE_ _RARE_ are curved _RARE_ as seen from the anode aperture
property of the _RARE_ fiber _RARE_ can be utilized to _RARE_ the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat _RARE_ or coupling member
same reason , the output fiber plate is _RARE_ , its exposed flat side _RARE_ contact _RARE_ if a permanent record is desired
will be shown later , the _RARE_ properties of the _RARE_ and output fiber _RARE_ comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design
photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate _RARE_
_RARE_ S , phosphor _RARE_ P , and anode _RARE_ V of the individual stages shall be distinguished by means of _RARE_ 1 , and 2 , in the text , where required
are assumed to have unity magnification
of flux gain flux gain of a single stage The luminous gain of a single stage with Af ( flux gain ) is , to a first approximation , given by the product of the photocathode sensitivity S ( _RARE_ / _RARE_ ) , the anode potential V ( _RARE_ ) , and the phosphor conversion efficiency P ( _RARE_ )
, P is a function of V and the current density , but it shall here be assumed as a constant
efficiency Af of a photocathode depends on the maximum _RARE_ sensitivity Af and on the spectral distribution of the incident light Af by the relation : Af where Af is _RARE_ _RARE_ photocathode sensitivity
standard _RARE_ function
flux gain of a single stage is given by : Af
input light distribution falls beyond the visible range , Af as expected , since Af
are not considered here
fiber _RARE_ The efficiency of fiber _RARE_ plates depends on four factors : ( A ) numerical aperture ( _RARE_ ) ; ; ( B ) end ( _RARE_ reflection ) losses ( R ) ; ; ( C ) internal losses ( _RARE_ ) ; ; ( D ) packing efficiency ( _RARE_ )
aperture of the fibers is given by : Af where Af
Af is measured in the medium of index Af
, as generally used in image intensifiers , have low optical contact with the substrate surface , hence Af shall be assumed
aperture should be in general close to unity
can be satisfied , e.g. , with Af and Af or equivalent glass combinations
good approximation for determining the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the angle independent _RARE_ formula : Af
to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming Af , we obtain Af percent
may be reduced to _RARE_ percent by means of a ( very thin ) glass _RARE_ of index 1.5
the Af factor for the output fiber _RARE_ is Af
index of _RARE_ of _RARE_ surfaces of the _RARE_ lies around 2 , the _RARE_ losses at the _RARE_ _RARE_ are about _RARE_ percent and the Af factor for the _RARE_ _RARE_ is _RARE_
be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further
losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal _RARE_ due to _RARE_ from the prescribed , cylindrical fiber _RARE_ and minute _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_
depend on fiber diameter and length , absorption _RARE_ , the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last , but not least , on the angular distribution of the incident light
( integral _RARE_ ) are given in the literature
data for some of the variables , we are _RARE_ on experimental data of about 20 percent internal losses for _RARE_ long , small ( 5 - 10 M ) diameter fibers
high value is probably due to the small fiber _RARE_ increasing the number of internal _RARE_
are considering here relatively small diameter ( 1 - 1.5 inches ) fiber plates , their average thickness can be kept below _RARE_ inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent ( per plate )
efficiency , _RARE_ , of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature , probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used , until rather recently
fibers in a closely packed _RARE_ _RARE_ , the packing efficiency is given by : Af where Af , and _RARE_ is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the _RARE_ _RARE_
small diameter fibers now _RARE_ feasible and required for about 100 Af resolution , Af
thickness is about _RARE_ M , hence , Af and Af
the efficiency _RARE_ _RARE_ is given by -- Af or approximately 50 percent each
be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ , in addition to an optical output lens system
Af of an Af lens at the magnification Af is : Af
, the end losses of the coupling _RARE_ and the output window Af would be 6 percent and 8 percent
the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates ( with a combined efficiency of _RARE_ ) is _RARE_ or about six times less than that of the two fiber plates
fiber coupled image intensifiers _RARE_ the brightness gain Af due to the Af area _RARE_ , the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is : Af
obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which _RARE_ Af for a given input E ( in the case of the second stage , for the first phosphor screen emission ) is very important
consideration should govern the choice of the _RARE_ phosphor screen for matching with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate _RARE_ ( e.g. , _RARE_ _RARE_ )
evaluated the `` matching _RARE_ '' for two types of _RARE_ ( _RARE_ and _RARE_ ) and three types of light input
light distributions considered are _RARE_ and _RARE_ phosphor emission and the so-called `` night light '' ( _RARE_ ) as given by _RARE_ _RARE_ and J. J. Johnson
( in units ) are listed in table _RARE_ , below
of _RARE_ device resolution resolution limitations in a single stage The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the _RARE_ _RARE_ screen
capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic _RARE_
been stated previously that a _RARE_ electrostatic system _RARE_ a lower resolution than a _RARE_ system or a system with unity magnification
the chromatic _RARE_ depend on the chosen high voltage
, a high anode voltage _RARE_ chromatic _RARE_ and thus increases the obtainable resolution
gain of the discussed tube was calculated from _RARE_ ( 6 ) for the 16 possible combinations of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ phosphor screens , for night light and _RARE_ light input
_RARE_ input is of interest because it _RARE_ roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray _RARE_ screens )
_RARE_ obtained from _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ were used : Af
table ( _RARE_ ) lists the ( luminous ) gain values computed according to _RARE_ ( 6 ) with Af
of a space charge _RARE_ of the screen _RARE_ of the elementary electron _RARE_ has been pointed out
obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels
influences will also decrease at increased _RARE_
of the _RARE_ type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying _RARE_
of 70 - 80 _RARE_ per _RARE_ appears to be feasible
resolution of a _RARE_ phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness ( with increasing anode voltage ) , decreases with _RARE_ _RARE_ ( thus the advantage of _RARE_ phosphor _RARE_ ) and might be _RARE_ by the normally used aluminum mirror
in general , elementary light optical effects , light _RARE_ , and electron _RARE_ determine the obtainable resolution limit
be noted that _RARE_ , due to `` _RARE_ '' generated within the _RARE_ screen by electron impact , appears to be important only if anode _RARE_ in excess of 30 _RARE_ are utilized
been stated that settled _RARE_ phosphor screens may have a _RARE_ resolution of 60 Af at high voltage values of approximately 20 Aj
further discussion , we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 Af and phosphor screen resolution of 60 Af
of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy
policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by _RARE_ the value of the product
thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The _RARE_ of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The _RARE_ of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The _RARE_ of the objective function of which the _RARE_ is desired
chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream
second we might have to choose the volume of _RARE_ or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of _RARE_ is discussed in the next chapter
function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4
characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no _RARE_ was first isolated by _RARE_
that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal _RARE_ policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of _RARE_ the complete process
by _RARE_ varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal _RARE_ policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages
this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number
step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied
how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ; then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Af ( where a is some number not _RARE_ large )
from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for _RARE_ ; ; this number will be of the order of Af
however , we are seeking the optimal R-stage policy for a given feed state , only one search for a maximum is required at the final step
number of operations of the order of Af are required
the operating variables were varied simultaneously , Af operations would be required to do the same job , and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program
more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages
, the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages
problem is _RARE_ to require a complete coverage of feed states , Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search
is _RARE_ larger than R
is more _RARE_ than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital _RARE_ allows for use of the _RARE_ of methods in searching out a result
Af , and that the average operation requires only Af _RARE_
dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three _RARE_
of _RARE_ thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a _RARE_ decision process
1957 ) has _RARE_ in the following terms : `` An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are , the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision ''
the principle which we will _RARE_ in every case to set up a functional equation
in a form that is _RARE_ suited to the powers of the digital computer
same time , every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value , and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic _RARE_ that room is left for _RARE_ in using the special features of the problem to this end
discrete _RARE_ process Consider the process illustrated in Fig. _RARE_ , consisting of R distinct stages
be _RARE_ in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream , so that stage R is the T stage from the end
state of the stream leaving stage R be denoted by a vector Af and the operating variables of stage R by Af
denotes the state of the feed to the R-stage process , and Af the state of the product from the last stage
_RARE_ the state Af of its feed to the state Af in a way that depends on the operating variables Af
this Af
is uniquely determined by Af and we therefore speak of the process as _RARE_
situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions , and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set S
of vectors Af _RARE_ the operating policy or , more briefly , the policy , and a policy is admissible if all the Af belong to S
policy has been chosen , the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation ( 1 ) ; ; thus Af
function , which is to be _RARE_ , is some function , usually _RARE_ continuous , of the product state
be denoted by Af
policy is an admissible policy Af which _RARE_ the objective function P
may not be unique but the maximum value of P certainly is , and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as a function of the feed state Af
where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af
is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af
choice of admissible policy Af in the first stage , the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by Af
the feed state of the subsequent Af stages which , according to the principle of _RARE_ , must use an optimal _RARE_ policy with respect to this state
result in a value Af of the objective function , and when Af is chosen _RARE_ this will give Af , the maximum of the objective function
where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af , and Af is related to Af by ( 5 )
of equations ( 6 ) can be solved for Af when Af is known , and clearly Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af
of equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and the starting equation ( 7 ) is of a _RARE_ type well suited to _RARE_ on the digital computer
the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages , only the function Af is needed
has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of Af and the whole calculation repeated
see how the results may be presented , although if _RARE_ , the number of state variables , is large any _RARE_ will become _RARE_
or set of tables may be set out as in Table _RARE_
the optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af , we enter section R of this table at the state Af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function
third column is given the optimal policy for stage R , and in the fourth , the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used
the principle of _RARE_ the remaining stages use an optimal _RARE_ policy with respect to Af , we may enter section Af of the table at this state Af and read off the optimal policy for stage Af and the resulting state Af
this way up the table we _RARE_ the complete optimal policy and , if it is desired , we can check on Af by evaluating Af at the last stage
be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af , as when the cost of the operating policy is considered
reflection shows that the above _RARE_ and presentation work equally well in this case
of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af
represents the value of the stream in state P and Q the cost of operating the stage with conditions Q
is the increase in value of the stream _RARE_ the cost of operation , that is , the net profit
denotes the net profit from stage R and Af , then the principle of _RARE_ gives Af
of equations may be started with the remark that with no process Af there is no profit , i.e. , Af
discrete _RARE_ process The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only _RARE_ is also of interest , although for chemical _RARE_ design it is not as important as the _RARE_ process
case the stage R operating with conditions Af _RARE_ the state of the stream from Af to Af , but only the probability distribution of Af is known
specified by a distribution function Af such that the probability that Af lies in some region D of the stage space is Af
now speak of _RARE_ the value of the objective function , since this function is now known only in a _RARE_ sense
, however , _RARE_ its expected value
single stage we may define Af where the maximization is by choice of Af
have an optimal policy which _RARE_ the expected value of the objective function for a given Af
consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next , then the principle of _RARE_ shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first
, the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space
of presentation of results used in the _RARE_ process may be used here , except that now the fourth column is _RARE_
column gives the optimal policy , but we must wait to see the outcome of stage R and enter the preceding section of the table at this state
of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter
continuous _RARE_ process In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages , since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process
_RARE_ , the number of the stage from the end of the process , by _RARE_ , a continuous variable which measures the `` distance '' of the point considered from the end of the process
distance is used here in a rather general sense ; ; it may in fact be the time that will _RARE_ before the end of the process
is the total `` length '' of the process , its feed state may be denoted by a vector _RARE_ and the product state by _RARE_
the state at any point T and Q the vector of operating variables there
platform system , using _RARE_ _RARE_ , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the _RARE_ combination
gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , _RARE_ _RARE_ effects , as follows : Af where U is a _RARE_ applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro
angle **yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling
normally _RARE_ the gyro input axis , _RARE_ away from the gyro output or _RARE_ axis
angular momentum is defined by H
the gyro and _RARE_ combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis , the system can be _RARE_ with an angular velocity Af if a _RARE_ is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj
assumed that the _RARE_ are designed with electrical _RARE_ so that a _RARE_ can be applied about their output axes
system shown in Fig. 7-1 , the accelerometer output is _RARE_ and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro _RARE_ _RARE_
causes the entire system to _RARE_ about the **yf axis , since the response to Af
_RARE_ are correct , the platform _RARE_ in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero
accelerometer output is _RARE_ , the _RARE_ applied to the gyro output axis decreases and , therefore , the rate decreases
when the accelerometer output is zero , the entire system remains _RARE_ , and the platform is , by definition , leveled
block _RARE_ for the leveling system is shown in Fig. _RARE_
is initially off level by the angle Aj
generated by the platform _RARE_ **yf _RARE_ by G is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer
the scale factor of the accelerometer ( Af )
Af is _RARE_ by Af and applied to the gyro _RARE_ with scale factor Af
the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af
as indicated in Fig. _RARE_ is fundamental and simple because the _RARE_ effects of both the platform _RARE_ and the accelerometer have been neglected
factors included , an upper limit is placed on the _RARE_ loop gain by stability considerations
type of system , a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time
frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered , their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain
required for the system to reach a level position is approximately _RARE_ proportional to the _RARE_ loop gain
, the _RARE_ frequency for input _RARE_ is approximately proportional to the _RARE_ loop gain ; ; i.e. , high loop gain causes the system to respond to _RARE_ components of _RARE_
usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time
be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer _RARE_ to any input acceleration
relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af
, the _RARE_ leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the _RARE_
system is arranged for automatic leveling , the platform angles respond to any _RARE_ components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers
many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind _RARE_ , engine noise , _RARE_ around the vehicle , etc.
the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of _RARE_ acceleration noise
to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include _RARE_ _RARE_
causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform _RARE_
lower loop gain and _RARE_ _RARE_ increases the response time , a practical _RARE_ must be reached
the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a _RARE_ amplifier for Af
is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level
level , the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value , in order to provide adequate noise _RARE_
is that the platform returns from an _RARE_ position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level , at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional _RARE_ with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process
system is on automatic leveling , the gyro drift is _RARE_ by the output of the leveling system ( amplifier Af )
actually _RARE_ off level so that the accelerometer output , when _RARE_ by Af , will supply the correct current to the gyro _RARE_ to _RARE_ the gyro drift
of platform _RARE_ required depends upon the scale factors of the system

considerations
leveling system described in this section is readily _RARE_ to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three _RARE_ _RARE_
requires some _RARE_ of flight equipment _RARE_
the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled _RARE_ with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform
system will hold the platform _RARE_ , automatically , as long as the system is _RARE_
_RARE_ of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift _RARE_ is available from the _RARE_ necessary to hold the system in level
process can be accomplished _RARE_ , and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment
consists in turning the platform _RARE_ until the _RARE_ of both accelerometers are zero
is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro _RARE_ described above
, the human _RARE_ amplifier Af in Figs. 7-1 and _RARE_
requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer _RARE_
accuracy is required in _RARE_ leveling , it is usually necessary to _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ the accelerometer _RARE_ ( this also _RARE_ the noise problem )
, the effect of a small acceleration ( or small platform _RARE_ angle ) can be seen after a time
skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy
it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach
is _RARE_ if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time
must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro _RARE_ so that the effect of gyro drift is _RARE_
is especially difficult since gyro _RARE_ is _RARE_ random


consists of _RARE_ the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the _RARE_
terms , it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction
_RARE_ _RARE_ , two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading : Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading ; ; Use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading
of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements , field conditions , and the time available to accomplish the heading

of heading -- surveying technique
gyro-stabilized platform leveled , it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques
accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure
accelerometers are mounted on the platform , the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined
is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is _RARE_ to the sensitive axis of the unit

transit is set up so that it is _RARE_ with respect to true north
be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques
transit set up , a mirror on one of the accelerometers is _RARE_ and the platform is turned until it is _RARE_
procedure includes the use of a _RARE_ for the transit to project a beam of light , which is darkened by crossed hairs , on the accelerometer mirror
platform is _RARE_ , the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly _RARE_ upon the original crossed hairs
can easily be _RARE_ with a high degree of accuracy
is turned as required by supplying _RARE_ to the appropriate gyro _RARE_
technique is simple and satisfactory , one practical difficulty does exist : the direction of true north must be known for each _RARE_ point
this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few _RARE_ work
installations , the _RARE_ platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight
situation , it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment
platform is not too high off the ground , a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform
the heading accuracy is _RARE_ by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand

can be replaced by an _RARE_
provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular _RARE_ of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading
signal from the _RARE_ is _RARE_ and supplied to the _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ is correct , the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero
also available from this _RARE_ system to set the drift _RARE_ for the _RARE_ gyro
_RARE_ gyro is _RARE_ , a current generated by the _RARE_ is delivered to the gyro _RARE_ to _RARE_ the drift
drift error is systematic , it can be _RARE_ with a _RARE_ _RARE_ which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required _RARE_ current

possible to locate an angular electrical _RARE_ , which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform
the _RARE_ or reference portion of the _RARE_ is established with respect to the true heading direction , and the platform is turned either _RARE_ or automatically until the angular electrical _RARE_ signal is reduced to zero


is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading
case of a purely _RARE_ _RARE_ consisting of three _RARE_ _RARE_ , a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the X accelerometer is parallel to the _RARE_ direction at the base point , and the _RARE_ accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the _RARE_ direction at the base point
are mounted _RARE_ on the platform

did not go back to school
talked seriously and _RARE_ to their own doctor and to a _RARE_ at the University Hospital -- Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family -- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty much as he chose -- provided , of course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too _RARE_
and his school principal were _RARE_ with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term
the decision with indifference and did not enter the _RARE_
_RARE_ from the hospital after a _RARE_ _RARE_ and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley described as a `` _RARE_ lunch '' at the _RARE_ on the campus
a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , _RARE_ at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with _RARE_
sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a _RARE_ , looking about at the huge _RARE_ _RARE_ of the room with an expression of _RARE_
men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles -- came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel
_RARE_ , Scotty _RARE_
the _RARE_ food with its orange _RARE_ and Scotty _RARE_ without interest at his food , the teachers , the heroic _RARE_ windows , and the bright ranks of college _RARE_
tried to make the food a _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ is good , Scotty
it ''
at his son , his face worried
, `` No , thanks '' , so softly his father had to bend his _RARE_ height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him
the ear and the _RARE_ hair around it with a moment of interest
more loudly , `` I'm full , old _RARE_ ''
eaten almost nothing on the _RARE_ , _RARE_ plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container
all right , _RARE_ '' , Rachel said
can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home ''
_RARE_ , Scotty had had little appetite ; ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of _RARE_
was _RARE_ ; ; his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become _RARE_
now with his mouth open , showing a _RARE_ _RARE_ section of lower teeth ; ; he kept his eyes , with their _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , always lowered , though not , apparently , _RARE_
neck seemed _RARE_ and , therefore , _RARE_
, which had been as quick as a pair of _RARE_ birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed
on his lap , _RARE_ up , stiffly _RARE_ , the _RARE_ fingers a little thick at the _RARE_
had , since the _RARE_ , the appearance of a boy who _RARE_ in food and took no exercise
lazy , spoiled , a little _RARE_
little to say
her husband's colleagues with smiling _RARE_ , offering nothing
, for all his _RARE_ and his easy familiarity , was completely alert to his son , eyes always on the still face , jumping to _RARE_ Scotty's desires
a strained , silent lunch
, `` I'd better get him to bed ''
had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger
McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth
not speak much
out at ugly gray _RARE_ and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids ''
a Negro section of peeling row houses , _RARE_ _RARE_ and ragged children
to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat
, `` Nothing ''
: `` There are lots of kids around here ''
at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull
tired and full and calm
days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each day , almost the same
late and went down in his _RARE_ and _RARE_ to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel
him with attention and tried to _RARE_ his appetite with special food : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ -- the result of devoted hours in the _RARE_ kitchen
_RARE_ over him and , looking like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty's fork or _RARE_
don't eat enough , honey
get that down ''
observing , would say , `` He has to _RARE_ his own capacity
time ''
Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as _RARE_ who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere
Scotty constantly , Rachel without seeming to , Virginia openly , her eyes filled with concern
neutral
not _RARE_ their supervision or _RARE_ sometimes _RARE_ sympathy
what he felt like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the _RARE_ rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow , _RARE_ steps , like an elderly tourist in a _RARE_
was gone
able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the _RARE_ yard without moving
lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost _RARE_ , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open
was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was _RARE_ , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder
not mentioned Kate
not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly , almost _RARE_ , encounter her
times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it was an objective pain , in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; ; it was like the _RARE_ wound on the back of his head which occasionally _RARE_ ; ; it was merely another part of his weakness
calm , _RARE_ , and lazy
not care
Kate
, `` I notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit ''
, `` That's all right
right ''
about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk to something else
sitting at the front window in his _RARE_ room , he saw Kate come out of her house
with _RARE_
far off and looked tiny
branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them
at the bottom of _RARE_ steps and moved off in the direction of the park
he saw -- it _RARE_ and , for a moment , interested him -- that _RARE_ held a _RARE_ in her hand and that a round _RARE_ _RARE_ was on the end of the _RARE_
disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed
time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate
, since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him , came often and _RARE_ to the house
sit , _RARE_ and spare , on the edge of Scotty's bed , his legs crossed so _RARE_ that the crossed foot could tap the floor
not mind the doctor's _RARE_ _RARE_ as he used to
young man '' , he said with mock _RARE_
imagine you're always _RARE_ in school ''
don't go to school any more ''
''
had to bend close to hear ; ; his delicate hand , as _RARE_ as a _RARE_ wing , rested absently on Scotty's chest
the same words more loudly

we're taking a little vacation , that's all ''
_RARE_ to Rachel
think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little
now but the weakness is very definite ; ; it would _RARE_ him further and _RARE_
stronger soon ''
was on the table by Scotty's bed and he picked it up and _RARE_ it at Scotty
_RARE_ , `` Just keep the cap on those strong emotions ''
_RARE_ silver in the _RARE_ room
drop by again in a few days ''
on after the doctor had gone
the covers on Scotty's bed and picked things up from the floor
not touch him
with _RARE_
not speak
no desire to
, `` Do you think you'll miss school ''
noticed how formal and _RARE_ exact Rachel had grown
not care
her _RARE_ did not concern him , yet he knew he would not care even if it did
his head
had any number of calls about you
win a _RARE_ contest at that school without any trouble
called twice
to pay you a visit
the children miss you
were the light of their lives ''
slightly
close to the bed , bent as if she would kiss him , then moved away
frowning
doctor _RARE_ me ''
to speak to herself
you suppose his _RARE_ is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of _RARE_ in general ''
to him again
, Mrs. Charles -- Sally -- has _RARE_ too
very worried ''
was dry
didn't really say '' -- She glanced away at the floor , then _RARE_ gracefully and picked up one of Scotty's _RARE_
mean , do you feel like seeing Kate ''
, `` I don't know ''
true
not
the slight pain , but it was no different from the _RARE_ in his head
, there's time , in any case
till you're stronger and then talk about it ''
the _RARE_ neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed
, `` Okay ''
Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead
pleased
was a constant _RARE_
hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow voice ; ; it _RARE_ up the stairs
Scotty ''
or _RARE_ reply : `` better
plenty of rest ''
his appetite improved ''
`` Does he get exercise ''
was almost _RARE_ , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it
smiled
an energy he no longer possessed to be _RARE_ about his father
would come upstairs and stand _RARE_ at the foot of the bed and look at his son
pause , during which he studied Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs
reply softly and his father , _RARE_ , would ask him to repeat
eating more '' , he would say
`` I walk around the house a lot ''
you should get out a little ''
not supposed to yet ''
not _RARE_
not mind the useless , _RARE_ questions
at the lined face with vague interest ; ; he felt he was _RARE_ it , as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger
examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his _RARE_ _RARE_
you got enough blankets ''
time , without _RARE_ : `` You never wore that _RARE_ I bought you ''
sharp edges seemed _RARE_ as sea waves _RARE_ themselves upward in angry motion , Papa-san sat _RARE_ , his smooth _RARE_ , his very _RARE_ _RARE_ all the _RARE_ about him
objective '' , the colonel had said that day of the _RARE_ , `` is Papa-san ''
objective sat , brooding over all
burn , _RARE_ , _RARE_ it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san
_RARE_ _RARE_ and himself , in the valley over which Papa-san _RARE_ , men had hidden high _RARE_ , _RARE_ traps , and mines
valley was a pregnant _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire
_RARE_ base _RARE_ of _RARE_ stretched out of eye range like a wild _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , stopped simultaneously , _RARE_ poised as if _RARE_ the magic of the child's touch to start them all rolling again
, regular _RARE_ of barbed wire hung on timber supports
all _RARE_ labor
clean up the mess when the war was over
his _RARE_ thoughts , Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down
group of men , tomorrow night he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait
were to go with White , he would be out there two days , not just listening in the dark at some point between here and Papa-san , but moving ever deeper into enemy land -- behind Papa-san -- itself
what he had expected
realized that there would be so much time to think , so many _RARE_
had forgotten what he must have been told , that combat was an _RARE_ activity
knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have to be approached
take place tomorrow night , or it might occur months from now
just too much time
become afraid
_RARE_ , but he did not like the identity
not _RARE_ over with hatred for the enemy
even seen him yet _RARE_ his cigarette out in the earth , Warren walked to the _RARE_ and scanned the _RARE_ hills
no life , but still stood there for a time peering at the _RARE_ hills , his gaze continually returning to Papa-san
come here in order to test himself
of his beliefs were still _RARE_ , he knew that he did not believe in killing
he was here
come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a _RARE_
ten men on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night
_RARE_ was carrying a _RARE_ machine gun ; ; another man _RARE_ the _RARE_ and a box of ammunition
White each carried , in addition to their own weapons and _RARE_ , a box of _RARE_ for the _RARE_ machine gun
extra _RARE_ for the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , which was in the hands of a little Mexican named _RARE_
_RARE_ the two new men that afternoon
just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot had said
sure the man nearest you is awake
doesn't show up , we'll all be back here at _RARE_ hours
we hold a reception
pull out under our mortar and _RARE_ cover , but nobody pulls out until I say so
I said about going out to get anybody left behind
holds
back all dead and wounded ''
hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the point of departure
the journey through their own mine fields

_RARE_ than theirs , some said
_RARE_ _RARE_ to jump and _RARE_ at _RARE_ level while we more _RARE_ had them go off at the head

and little
wooden _RARE_ of the enemy , our _RARE_ turned gray metal _RARE_
_RARE_ the _RARE_

_RARE_ , a leg missing

: big ones , some _RARE_ to set off a whole field , little ones , hand _RARE_ size
to fill the head with _RARE_ of metal
to shake off the _RARE_ of his fears by looking at the sky
dark
said that the _RARE_ would be bounced off the clouds at _RARE_ hours , `` which gives us time to get settled in position ''
were new men and to be sure that they didn't get lost , Prevot had placed Warren and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out
now fixed on _RARE_ solid figure , Warren could hear behind him the _RARE_ of another
also hear the stream which he had seen from his position
going to follow it for part of their journey
safe '' , Prevot had said , `` and it provides cover for our noise ''
were picking their way along the edge of the stream which _RARE_ in the night
right rose the _RARE_ covered with brush and trees
branch extended out too far , each man held it back for the next , and if they met a low _RARE_ , each warned the other
_RARE_ they advanced _RARE_ ; ; then they turned to the right , climbed the _RARE_ , and walked into the valley again
no cover here , only grass _RARE_ against _RARE_
each sigh , like a whip in the hand of an expert , the grass stripped something from Warren
_RARE_ of each _RARE_ left him more naked than before , until he felt his _RARE_ flesh tremble , _RARE_ by each new sound
of the men ahead of him _RARE_ _RARE_ , as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh
forms moved like _RARE_ on some _RARE_ _RARE_ , their _RARE_ _RARE_ for want of vocal _RARE_
, broken trees in the valley assumed _RARE_ shapes
brush that they passed were so many _RARE_ _RARE_ straining in anger to _RARE_ and _RARE_ on his bones
all , Papa-san _RARE_ down at him , threatening a hundred hidden _RARE_
the distance a _RARE_ flashed on , its beam _RARE_ the sky
_RARE_ was absorbed by a cloud , then reflected to the earth in a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
there another patrol had need of light
of all the men out that night who , like himself , had left their _RARE_ ridge and -- fear working at their guts -- picked their way into the area beyond
east to the west coast of the _RARE_ _RARE_ was a strip of land in which _RARE_ men were at that same moment _RARE_ crawling through the night , sitting in _RARE_ anticipation of any movement or sound , or shouting _RARE_ confused rifle _RARE_ and muzzle _RARE_
went up and Warren raised his own
was stopping
up ``
spot over there '' , he whispered , pointing to a small _RARE_ of _RARE_
me your machine gun _RARE_ ''
him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line
the grass behind the brush _RARE_ , Warren looked about
likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush
shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew
this short distance they were only vague shapes , setting up the machine gun on a small _RARE_ so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol
his _RARE_ safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another _RARE_ of ammunition from one of the cloth _RARE_ that marked the upper part of his body with an Aj
placed within quick reach
and his fears had served to _RARE_ him and his _RARE_ _RARE_ cooled at the touch of the night air
_RARE_ _RARE_ fitted the upper part of his body _RARE_ , he felt no security
to _RARE_ in the surrounding dark ; ; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and _RARE_ even as he watched
_RARE_ was only imaginary , he yet stared in _RARE_ horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon
aware of insistent inner _RARE_ , as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body
the _RARE_ ivory _RARE_ of their _RARE_ pointed at the clouds , _RARE_ the _RARE_ dark to a _RARE_ light
figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees , standing like the _RARE_ of a medieval _RARE_ scene
, he could not ease the tension of his body ; ; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax
_RARE_ presence of the other men in the patrol , he felt _RARE_ _RARE_ to these nine _RARE_ sharing this _RARE_ of being with him
something precious in the _RARE_ moment , something _RARE_ to the knowledge gained on his _RARE_ trip through the French _RARE_ , a knowledge _RARE_ in _RARE_
France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone _RARE_ men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their _RARE_
poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning -- enough to make his being _RARE_ with the desire for the _RARE_ he sensed there
that _RARE_ mystery through which he traveled for thirty days , sleeping in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ or alongside roads , had worked some subtle change in him , he knew , and it was in _RARE_ that he had met Pierre
no hands ; ; they had been _RARE_ at the _RARE_
cups fitted in his _RARE_ , he _RARE_ his _RARE_
Warren had traveled together for four days
the _RARE_ at _RARE_ and Pierre had to sign the register , _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of the visiting _RARE_
the pen in his _RARE_ and began to write


guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside
the small room and peered over one _RARE_ shoulders to watch the _RARE_ man write his name in the book
_RARE_ '' , they exclaimed
, _RARE_
''
the questions came , eager , interested questions , and many _RARE_ on his having overcome his _RARE_
it ever bother you '' , Warren had asked , `` to have people always asking you about your hands ''
, the French are a very curious people '' , Pierre had laughed
are also honest _RARE_ after truth
English are painfully silent about my missing hands
to mention or to notice that they are not there
, like yourself , take the fact for granted , try to be helpful , but don't ask questions
to all three , but I think the French have the _RARE_ attitude ''
the day that Pierre had told Warren about the _RARE_ of _RARE_
are looking tired and there you can rest
be good for you
, too '' , he said , his dark eyes _RARE_ , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the _RARE_ about which you have spoken ''
weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the _RARE_ gate
who opened the door immediately _RARE_ his worries about his reception : `` I speak English '' , the old man said , `` but I do not hear it very well ''
and stuck a large finger with white hairs _RARE_ on it into his ear as though that might help
_RARE_ _RARE_ , the old _RARE_ took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor
you please wait in here
over his second _RARE_ in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue
_RARE_ was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of beer , _RARE_ smoke , and Italian cooking
the bar was an oil painting of a nude _RARE_ had accepted from a student at the _RARE_ _RARE_ who needed to eat and drink and was broke
was small and _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and was called `` _RARE_ ''
one place where _RARE_ could go for a drink in a back _RARE_ without anyone _RARE_ him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the _RARE_
_RARE_ were taxi drivers and art students and small _RARE_
had not yet discovered that this was his _RARE_

_RARE_ a camera ; ; the distant ship isn't there until you get the focus
what I'm talking about
all girls feel this way about men until they live with them
when it comes to war , the Colonel knows what it is and _RARE_ doesn't
knows that a soldier will get the _RARE_ Service _RARE_ for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian

the matter was urgent
was uneasy about the visit

something _RARE_ and _RARE_ about him

was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell
a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic , hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President would appear
not
he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and _RARE_ with his point of view
hour later the Vice President arrived
very carefully at every piece of _RARE_ , as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind
the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the hall , the _RARE_ painting in the library , as well as the long _RARE_ of _RARE_ volumes ; ; the pattern of the _RARE_ rug , the delicate _RARE_ _RARE_

not a _RARE_ question , Lawrence decided

did not tell him at what cost , at what _RARE_ , he learned these things

President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they _RARE_ the Vice _RARE_ home , let me know

President said with a slight _RARE_ , `` There isn't anyone who loves the President more than I do
is my ideal
same time , you have to face facts and realize that a man who's been in the Marine Corps all his life doesn't understand much about politics
a _RARE_ know about sex ''
with the _RARE_ , _RARE_ calm of the lawyer , but his face was in the shadow
, we have to protect the old man for his own good
what I mean
full of _RARE_ , and if you want to get along with them , you have to be _RARE_
why I say we just can't go ahead and _RARE_ the Germans and pull down our own defenses
tell you what happened to me today
came up to me , a Senator , I don't have to tell you his name , and he told me , ' I love the President like a brother , but God damn it , he's _RARE_ me
a quarter of a million Germans in my state , and those _RARE_ tune in on Father _RARE_ every night , and if he tells them to go out and _RARE_ in the public square , that's what they do
them now to write letters to their _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ of Germany
one comes to me and he says , ' Look here , there's a mill in my state _RARE_ five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy
looked at him coldly and said , `` Take it or leave it ''
there was nothing else to do
caught in a machine
was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let's go and see what it's like ''
about _RARE_ miles west of _RARE_ , near the _RARE_ _RARE_ and on the _RARE_ River , a small and dirty stream
was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its _RARE_ , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama
had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived -- servants and _RARE_ huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and _RARE_ were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime
by train from _RARE_ and looked the city over ; ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were
industries and factories
went down to Black Bottom
midst of this crowded region was the _RARE_ African _RARE_ _RARE_ Church
an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair
was a _RARE_
been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it
just suffered a _RARE_ , the final crisis in a long series of _RARE_
old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city _RARE_ him
a _RARE_ man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability
stern and _RARE_ with his _RARE_ , but _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church
Board , headed by a black man named _RARE_ , had practically taken over as the pastor grew old , and had its way with the support of the Amen corner
thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious _RARE_
of old _RARE_ , chiefly women , listened weekly to a _RARE_
invariably in low tones , almost _RARE_ , and then gradually worked up to high , shrill _RARE_ to God and man
the Amen corner took hold , _RARE_ a form of group participation in worship that _RARE_ from years before the Greek _RARE_ , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West _RARE_ , and then here in Alabama
and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and _RARE_ , the corner group was _RARE_ by _RARE_ and shivering , _RARE_ , shouting , possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force
to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who _RARE_ behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion
ended in _RARE_ _RARE_ with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor
of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week
often _RARE_ in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting
on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like _RARE_
_RARE_ a short _RARE_ , trying to talk _RARE_ to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and what he proposed to do here
with them on the loss of their old pastor
, at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose
no chance to say another word
very end , when the audience was silent and _RARE_ , a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out
did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say
next weeks he looked over the situation
all there was the _RARE_ , an utterly impossible place for _RARE_ people to live in , _RARE_ poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years , with no _RARE_ or sewage , with _RARE_ and _RARE_
arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named _RARE_ who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The _RARE_ because of her sharp tongue and _RARE_ initiative
was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , _RARE_ a _RARE_ home and devoted to her church , but a _RARE_ _RARE_ and born _RARE_
over the new pastor like an _RARE_ angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and _RARE_ of which she was chief _RARE_
looked over the church and studied its condition
of the pastor had for years been _RARE_ _RARE_ and even this was in _RARE_
up his mind that he must receive at least _RARE_ , but when he mentioned this to the _RARE_ they said nothing
itself must be repaired
dirty and neglected
ought to be _RARE_ , and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this
the city itself should be talked to
in the colored section were dirty
_RARE_ and _RARE_
had nowhere to go and no place to play , not even _RARE_
was small , dark and _RARE_
was a _RARE_ fool
two liquor _RARE_ not very far from the church , one white , that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for Negroes ; ; the other exclusively Negro
there was a good deal of gambling in both
other side of the church was a quiet , _RARE_ house with _RARE_ and recently painted
about it
called Kent House
of the church , _RARE_ , was its _RARE_
the leading members of the Amen corner was cook ; ; there were two or three colored _RARE_ employed there
told that it was a sort of hotel for white people , which seemed to him rather _RARE_
a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom
it looked respectable
glad to have it there
of Black Bottom was a rabbit _RARE_ of homes in every condition of neglect , _RARE_ and careful _RARE_
carefully repaired _RARE_ , and _RARE_ painted and _RARE_ _RARE_ were _RARE_ together cheek by _RARE_ with little distinction
could not escape from the worst and the worst _RARE_ _RARE_ beside the better
, front and back , were narrow ; ; some were _RARE_ _RARE_ , some had flower _RARE_
_RARE_ , for there was no sewage system
about a bit , Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom , across the river and far removed from the white city , a considerable tract of land , and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot
about it to the _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ looked him over rather carefully
not sure what kind of a man he had in hand
was one thing that he had to stress , and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses , the dollar money , had been seriously falling behind in this church , and that must be looked after immediately
, he _RARE_ clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here -- to make a larger contribution of dollar money
the fact that clear as this was , they must have a better church , a more _RARE_ conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get this religious center out of its _RARE_ of wild worship into a modern church organization
to the _RARE_ _RARE_ the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river
_RARE_ was sure that that would be impossible
told Wilson to `` go ahead and try ''
tried
seem impossible
which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in _RARE_ , and the real estate people said _RARE_ that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in , and that none would be sold to colored folk
was proposed to _RARE_ the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high
sure that he could do better if he went to _RARE_ to get the deal financed
this proposal was made to his _RARE_ Board , he met _RARE_ opposition
certainly would not be removed
proposition was _RARE_
been here fifty years
going to stay forever
hardly possible to get any argument on the subject
_RARE_ , well , that might be looked into , but there was no hurry , no hurry at all
went downtown to a different _RARE_ , an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic , but he shook his head
'' , he said , `` I think you don't quite understand the situation here
see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church
stores , _RARE_ , some gambling , I hope not too much
people are getting employment at Kent House and other places , and they are near their places of employment
city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them
if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years
time , perhaps something better can be done ''
asked , `` What about this Kent House which you mention
understand why a white hotel should be down here ''
_RARE_ looked at him with a certain surprise , and then he said _RARE_ : `` I'm afraid I can't tell you anything in particular about Kent House
to find out about it on your own
see you again ''
dismissed the colored pastor
next day that _RARE_ came and sat beside him and took his hand
, `` My dear , do you know what Kent House is ''
'' , said Wilson , `` I don't
just asking about it
it ''
a house of _RARE_ for white men with white girls as _RARE_
a good deal of local labor , including two members of our _RARE_ Board
some supplies from our colored _RARE_ and they are _RARE_ by some of the best white gentlemen in town ''
at her
dear , you must be mistaken ''
to Mrs. _RARE_ '' , she said
Wilson had talked to Mrs. _RARE_ and to others , he was absolutely amazed
of course , was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities -- putting white houses of _RARE_ with colored girls in colored _RARE_ and carrying them on openly
had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing _RARE_ on the part of the Negroes as they became more _RARE_ and got better wages
situation of Kent House was more subtle
involved were larger and more regular
were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction
from the white town was greater and there was little publicity
, _RARE_ and _RARE_ of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes
Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go
him to leave this job now without _RARE_ anything would mean practically the end of his career in the _RARE_ church , if not in all _RARE_
in _RARE_ Place and handed the reins to _RARE_
a fog , which increased the darkness of the night
_RARE_ were no more than a _RARE_ glow
have been anywhere or nowhere
was that he was _RARE_ a _RARE_ from Dr. _RARE_
State _RARE_ was a sick man
had come from _RARE_ , who had once been a _RARE_ clerk
were always receiving _RARE_
would question such an errand
was filled up with _RARE_
_RARE_ the Old _RARE_ , _RARE_ home , where _RARE_ had once been killed
would have another death
outside it was an ordinary enough house of the _RARE_
heavily up the _RARE_ and rang the bell
bell at _RARE_ , the _RARE_ was _RARE_ too high
still Good Friday , after all
boy opened the door
not notice him
thinking chiefly of Cap
_RARE_ were to _RARE_ , there was no point in _RARE_ time
his way inside
moment the hall confused him
the largest house he had ever been in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel
no idea where _RARE_ room would be
half darkness the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the hall seemed enormous
somewhere were the _RARE_
be up there
his errand , but without bothering much to make it _RARE_ , for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army
not really want to kill , but as in the sexual act , there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be _RARE_ , even while you watched yourself giving way to it
no longer worried
be all right
that in this mood he could not be stopped
the sensation always surprised him
a _RARE_ he felt no part in
only watch with a sort of gentle _RARE_ while his body did these quick , _RARE_ , and efficient things
by the _RARE_ boy and _RARE_ heavily up the stairs
_RARE_ , but made for _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , not the great _RARE_ he wore
of his footsteps was like a muffled _RARE_
top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there _RARE_ in a dressing gown
and whispered his errand
_RARE_ held out his hand
little , Payne shook his head
had told him to deliver his package in person
said his father was sleeping , and then went through a _RARE_ at his father's door , to prove the statement
well '' , Payne said
will go ''
, but now that he knew where the _RARE_ _RARE_ was , he did not _RARE_ to go
out his pistol and fired it
no sound
_RARE_
, he smashed the butt down on _RARE_ _RARE_ head , over and over again
the first blow that was always difficult
, violence was _RARE_ easy
caught up into it and became a different person
did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would _RARE_ over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real
boy fled down the stairs , screaming , `` _RARE_ ''
not murder at all
more _RARE_ than that
merely clearing a way to what he had to do
for the sick room , found his pistol was broken , and threw it away
would do
he had known all about _RARE_
the door from inside
it in and tumbled into darkness
only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled
for the bed , jumped on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly
like finally getting into one's own _RARE_ to _RARE_ one's dreams
pulled him off
anything
at their arms
a lady there , in a _RARE_
not have wanted to hurt a lady
approached , this one fully dressed
knife went into his chest , he went down at once
mad '' , shouted Payne , as he ran out into the hall
mad '' , and only wished he had been
have made things so much easier
was not mad
only dreaming
down the stairs and out of the door
the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder
_RARE_ up , even from one's own dreams
air _RARE_ him
he saw , had fled
one did not expect much of people like _RARE_
his horse , walked it away , mounted , and _RARE_ it on
boy was close behind him
nigger boy turned back and he was alone
on and on
no idea where he was
time he came to an open field
field was better than a building , that was for sure , so he _RARE_ , turned off the horse , and plunged through the grass
curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; ; he knew he should get to Cap , but he didn't know how
sure , for he had done as he was told , hadn't he
find him and take care of him
a good tree , he _RARE_ up into it , found a comfortable _RARE_ , and curled up in it to sleep , like the _RARE_ bear he was , with his hands across his chest , as though _RARE_ with honey
made him tired , but he was not frightened
, _RARE_ _RARE_ was winding up a performance of A New _RARE_ To _RARE_ Old _RARE_
a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more
him
stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the _RARE_ , he must be doing it better than usual
_RARE_ _RARE_ ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raised his arm and _RARE_ : `` Where is my _RARE_ now ''
one of the high spots of the play
, as usual , loved it
delighted to see them so happy
had any worries , it was only the small ones , about Mother in New York , and his daughter _RARE_ and what she might be doing at this hour , with her Aunt Asia , in _RARE_
_RARE_ about his profession , if he has _RARE_ it long enough , but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those _RARE_ people out there , who might _RARE_ you or _RARE_ you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up to you
the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not
_RARE_ was quite right about one thing
had been in the green room
had brought her into the wings
could not act , one part suited her as well as any other , and so she was the first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water , holding it up to the box , high above her head , to Miss Harris , who had asked for it
been one of the first to collect her _RARE_
not so much that the shot had _RARE_ the audience , as that they had been _RARE_ already
them had seen Our American Cousin before , and unless Miss _RARE_ was on stage , there was not much to it
was hot and they were _RARE_ with boredom
had been empty , except for Harry Hawk , doing his star _RARE_
was fond of Harry Hawk , he was a dear , in or out of character , but he was not particularly funny
end of the _RARE_ the audience would _RARE_
looked at the _RARE_
, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out , you _RARE_ old _RARE_ ''
, otherwise Hawk
always a pause here , before the next line
when the gun went off
that explosion did not mean much
going off all over Washington City these days , because of the _RARE_ , and the theatre was not _RARE_
audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box
_RARE_ _RARE_ '' , it said _RARE_
delivered his line
_RARE_ a small _RARE_ cloud of smoke
forward
not heard what had been said
been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily
_RARE_ from the box , almost lost its balance , the flag _RARE_ there tore in the air , the figure landed on its left leg , fell on its hands , and pressed itself up
still had his arm raised towards the wings
_RARE_
not lower his arm
was so _RARE_ dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had _RARE_ into this one
for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The _RARE_
looked like the slave _RARE_ from that
also looked like a _RARE_ , _RARE_ away from the light
something _RARE_ and crazy about its motion that disturbed them
disappeared into the wings
had not shifted position , but he at last lowered his arm
screamed
no _RARE_ that scream
what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do
scream had a different note in it
of an urgent _RARE_ _RARE_ them awake like a _RARE_ of water
, one of the guests in the box , stood up and demanded water
was _RARE_
unexpected happened , one always asked for water if one were a woman , _RARE_ if one were a man
screamed again
Presidential box someone leaned over the _RARE_ and yelled : `` He has shot the President ''
everybody up
stage , Harry Hawk began to weep
brushed by him with the glass of water
began to move
City everyone lived in a bubble of _RARE_ , and one death might _RARE_ another
not exactly panic they gave way to , but they could not just sit there
voices , for no one could bear silence , _RARE_ out the sound of Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_
rear of the _RARE_ , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor
not give
Charles _RARE_ _RARE_ up on the stage and got the _RARE_ to _RARE_ him up to the box
audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the _RARE_ , on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water
the corridor door from the inside , and called for a doctor
Charles _RARE_ was forced through the _RARE_ and squeezed out into the _RARE_ corridor
straight to the Presidential box
, Mrs. Lincoln had lost her head , but nobody _RARE_ her for doing so now
a little blood on the _RARE_ of her dress , for the _RARE_ had slashed Miss _RARE_ companion , Major _RARE_ , with a knife
he was bleeding to death
look of him he wasn't that far gone
_RARE_ , the man spread his legs and , a third time , confronted them
, Katie reared , and _RARE_ in fear
moment , boy and _RARE_ hung in _RARE_
and , frantically , commanded the mare to _RARE_ straight ahead
stranger was _RARE_ still
bold arm , he dared once more to _RARE_ them
a third time , then , trembling , descended
_RARE_
_RARE_ , he _RARE_ with all his might and forced Katie to her knees
absurd

the ground coming up -- and the _RARE_ head
_RARE_ , he brought his fists together and struck
encountered _RARE_ hair and hard bone
_RARE_ a _RARE_ cry , spun about , and collapsed in the sand

something _RARE_ him though : as yet they hadn't Five days

of annoyance ran through him
_RARE_ hard , snapping on and _RARE_ some bad things that were trying to push their way into him
began to _RARE_ inside his head
his _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
came on , _RARE_ , just like a radio or _RARE_ box , whenever he started to worry too much about something , when the bad things tried to push their way into him
drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments , humming and _RARE_ within , beating the rhythm within
with anticipation about what would happen to the _RARE_ when they caught them
bastards over to me -- to me and my boys -- no nigger ever got what would be _RARE_ to them -- _RARE_ bastards
never heard the word _RARE_ before his life as a _RARE_ began
a word he was proud of , a word that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure , almost as if it were an exclusive possession , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly _RARE_ , four cuts above any of the folks back home
cuts at least '' , he chuckled to himself , `` and I owe it all to them ''
also made him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so labeled
it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball

like Coughlin run it anyway , one way or another

over and tried to shut out the noise , now much louder
into the blanket

sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water
, wide as the _RARE_ , where it ran by his place
was spinning
was not

I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning

the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him
make out what he was saying
it had to do with the log
he be concerned
so _RARE_ that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books , too
the two men are riding into the country , where they are going to dinner , they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves , who strip them of everything , including most of their clothes
must be a very learned man '' , says Voltaire to one of the _RARE_
learned man ''
_RARE_ in his face
_RARE_
to the chief himself
what university did you study ''

to believe that the _RARE_ chief never attended a higher institution
have become so _RARE_ '' , he says , `` surely you must have studied many arts and sciences ''
, annoyed by these questions , _RARE_ Voltaire down and _RARE_ at him that he not only never went to any school , but never even learned how to read
the two _RARE_ men reach their _RARE_ home , _RARE_ fears are once again aroused
is such a distinguished place , with such fine works of art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become _RARE_ by all this culture
surprise , however , their host gives them fresh clothes to put on , opens his purse to _RARE_ them money and _RARE_ them down before a good dinner
dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor
have pen and paper , please
in a hurry to write another _RARE_ against culture
the _RARE_ that Voltaire gave to _RARE_ of laughter at _RARE_ _RARE_ and that was soon _RARE_ in _RARE_ throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed _RARE_ later , but with the name of _RARE_ of _RARE_ , the famous _RARE_ , substituted for that of Rousseau

the same time how _RARE_
the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the _RARE_ , the lies , the _RARE_ , the errors , _RARE_ and even _RARE_ to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life
for example , could a Voltaire understand the strange _RARE_ in which a Rousseau would find himself when , soon after the _RARE_ of his first _RARE_ , he acquired still another title to _RARE_
as a _RARE_
composer
he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of _RARE_ through to _RARE_ as the result of a successful opera
_RARE_ in this _RARE_ was not great
efforts to get a performance for his _RARE_ _RARE_ invariably failed
good reasons
music had little merit
one day , while on a _RARE_ visit to the country home of a retired _RARE_ _RARE_ , Rousseau amused the company with a few little _RARE_ he had written , to which he attached no great importance
really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs
a few such songs together '' , they urged him
them onto some sort of little plot , and you'll have a _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
believe them
'' , he said
is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away ''
_RARE_ ''
ladies , _RARE_ by his music
must make an opera out of this material ''
wouldn't leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised
the _RARE_ and the bitterness of it
all his years of effort to become a composer , he should now , now when he was still _RARE_ _RARE_ to the critics of his _RARE_ on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ , be so close to a success in music and have to _RARE_ it
least appear to _RARE_ it
else could he do
on the one hand _RARE_ the arts and at the same time practice them , could you
yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself
music too

be too much
fault , of course , was _RARE_
was _RARE_ and that of the whole culture of this _RARE_ age
was _RARE_ type of music that he had been trying to write , and that he couldn't write
songs , however , were sweet _RARE_ from the heart , tender _RARE_ of his childhood , little _RARE_ that anyone could _RARE_ and that would make one want to weep

appear as a composer now
, _RARE_ for so long , was now _RARE_ to him
just for the ladies , and just for this once , for this one weekend in the country , he would make a little piece out of his _RARE_
were delighted and Jean Jacques was _RARE_
went to work to learn the parts which he wrote
, after the little _RARE_ had been given its _RARE_ _RARE_ rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ must now have the _RARE_ in order to give it the really _RARE_ performance it _RARE_
aware that he must seem like a _RARE_ , standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance
especially couldn't understand what troubled him

what was a contradiction in one's life
has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes , and saying yes when she meant no
to admit that though he couldn't agree to a public performance , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction , _RARE_ love to know how his work would sound when done by professional _RARE_ and by trained voices
simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think '' , he said
the _RARE_ , pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible
of the _RARE_ _RARE_ would not _RARE_ a work merely to see how it would sound
satisfy the _RARE_ curiosity

recalled that _RARE_ had once had a private performance of his opera _RARE_ , behind closed doors , just for himself alone
what was bothering Rousseau : that the writer of the _RARE_ of _RARE_ should now become known as the writer of an amusing little _RARE_
certainly be _RARE_
thought he saw a way out
me do the _RARE_ to the _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , he suggested
name will never appear
will even suspect that it is your work ''
Rousseau could agree
what crazy _RARE_ and turns of his emotions
one and the same time that his work might be turned down -- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author -- and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly _RARE_ how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself
anxious this _RARE_ of _RARE_ was for _RARE_
torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for _RARE_ , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks
emotions were _RARE_ up to new _RARE_ when , after acceptance and the first _RARE_ , there _RARE_ such a _RARE_ of excitement among _RARE_ music _RARE_ that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to _RARE_ him that the news had reached the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and that he was now _RARE_ that the work be offered first at the royal summer _RARE_ of _RARE_
honor of it
was your answer ''
asked , _RARE_ to appear _RARE_
refused '' , Duclos said
else could I do
_RARE_ was _RARE_ , of course
said I would first have to get the _RARE_ permission
was certain he would refuse ''
all this was
not this success come to him before he had plunged into his _RARE_ , and before he had committed himself to a life of _RARE_ and denial
when everything was opening up to him -- even the court of Louis 15
had to play a role of _RARE_
forth Duclos had to go , between M. De _RARE_ and Jean Jacques and between the _RARE_ _RARE_ and Jean Jacques again , as his little _RARE_ , The Village _RARE_ , though still _RARE_ , took on ever more importance
course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his _RARE_ friends
, naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles
it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most _RARE_ terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first _RARE_
was such that people who could not possibly have _RARE_ their way into the _RARE_ were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be _RARE_
to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of _RARE_ in a _RARE_ , Rousseau found himself _RARE_ in _RARE_ , trembling lest his _RARE_ become known , and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer
himself now , as he himself says in his _RARE_ , at a crucial point of his life
was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal _RARE_ called to take him to the _RARE_ , he did not bother to _RARE_
contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days
in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the King , the _RARE_ , the whole royal family and all the members of the highest _RARE_ would be present , _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ and others tried to stop him
can't go in that way ''

not ''
asked
is going to stop me ''
haven't dressed for the occasion ''
out to him
dressed as I always am '' , Rousseau said
better nor worse ''
home , yes '' , they argued
here you are in the _RARE_
King
De _RARE_ ''
they are here , then surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said
even more right
am the composer ''
in such a _RARE_ condition ''
is _RARE_ about me ''

it because of my _RARE_ that hair _RARE_ on my face
would grow there whether I washed myself or not
years ago I would have worn a beard with pride
without _RARE_ would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion
have changed , and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face
fashion
is the real _RARE_ here
15 , , since even he _RARE_
if you don't mind , I should like to hear my own piece performed ''
course behind his _RARE_ he didn't feel bold at all
lest his piece should fail
in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society , his fear of making some _RARE_ or _RARE_ remark
deeper than that : his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly _RARE_ to _RARE_ himself
walk out in the midst of his piece
before the court
King
the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began
from _RARE_ was as good as his word
_RARE_ and _RARE_ down the road , his horse kicking up clouds of dust , shouting : `` They're _RARE_
, they're _RARE_ , they are ''
him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight
hadn't _RARE_ the strength of his lungs , not at all
you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every _RARE_ with importance
observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there
, and I appreciate the sentiment
this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him _RARE_ , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can't say ; ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction
thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and mechanics _RARE_ on top of a stone wall , and this _RARE_ rider made us feel a good deal _RARE_ and more alert to the situation
down off the wall as if he had _RARE_ all of us , and we crouched behind it
heard people talk with _RARE_ about the British _RARE_ , but that only _RARE_ that a lot of people talk about things of which they are _RARE_ _RARE_
felt about the _RARE_ , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; ; and I know that I , myself , was _RARE_ with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun
to wipe my _RARE_ , but I didn't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I didn't dare to do anything about the _RARE_
would fire or not , just as chance _RARE_
a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun , because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it
, which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now , stopped for long enough to count to twenty ; ; and in that brief interval , a redcoat officer came tearing down the road , _RARE_ his horse fit to kill
know whether he was after our rider , who had gone by a minute before , or whether he was simply _RARE_ conditions ; ; but when he passed us by , a musket roared , and he reared his horse , swung it around , and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come
a fine and _RARE_ rider , but his skill was wasted on us
me and somewhere behind me , a rifle cracked
officer collapsed like a _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle , except that one _RARE_ foot caught in the _RARE_
by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , _RARE_ out the _RARE_ brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us -- while the horse crashed away through the brush
my _RARE_ to war and the insane _RARE_ war plays ; ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become
the _RARE_ were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us
state that the faster things happened , the _RARE_ they happened ; ; the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident
_RARE_ , there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to _RARE_ _RARE_
could not have been more than a matter of seconds , and then the front of the British army came into view
only hours since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed
very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , _RARE_ blood behind them
here , no _RARE_ , and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust
with _RARE_ fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and _RARE_
rank of them came down the road , and the faces were all the same , and they walked in a sea of dust
, hold your fire
fire ''
called , and what made it even more terrible and _RARE_ was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant , only some of them glancing toward the stone wall , from behind which the voice came
of their column had already passed us , when another officer came riding down the side of the road , not five _RARE_ from where we were
Simmons carried a musket , but he had loaded it with bird shot , and as the officer came opposite him , he rose up behind the wall and fired
there was a man in the saddle ; ; the next a _RARE_ horror on a horse that _RARE_ through the redcoat ranks , and during the next second or two , we all of us fired into the suddenly _RARE_ column of soldiers
, the road was filled with _RARE_ _RARE_ , marching four by four with a purpose as _RARE_ as death ; ; the next , a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their _RARE_ and their _RARE_ fury
course of this , they had fired on us ; ; but I have no memory of that
squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry _RARE_ ; ; and then I was adding my own voice to the _RARE_ of sound , _RARE_ more _RARE_ language than I ever thought I knew , _RARE_ and shouting , and aware that if I had passed water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet
have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his _RARE_ grip and fairly _RARE_ me out of there ; ; and then I came to some _RARE_ and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I _RARE_ Cousin Simmons by far
was running
realized that the _RARE_ had stopped their charge at the wall
hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching
to a stop in _RARE_ _RARE_ cow hole , a _RARE_ bit of _RARE_ with a muddy pool of water in its middle
_RARE_ _RARE_ sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the _RARE_ of some of the men , which was so great that they _RARE_ into the muddy water and _RARE_ up _RARE_ of it
, one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and _RARE_ his hot _RARE_
appear that we were cruel and _RARE_ , but no one had time to spend _RARE_ with poor _RARE_ -- except the Reverend
that I myself felt that it was a _RARE_ shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball , as _RARE_ had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself
drunk with excitement and the smell of _RARE_ that came _RARE_ down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next
I _RARE_ my gun , as the other men were doing
less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it
looked , you saw _RARE_ running across the _RARE_ , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty _RARE_ were making their way in our direction
and some others felt that we should _RARE_ toward _RARE_ and take up new positions ahead of the _RARE_ British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road
offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains _RARE_ out
that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much _RARE_ pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the _RARE_ of the road and their _RARE_ and ammunition _RARE_
was being discussed , we saw the _RARE_ to the west of us _RARE_ out and breaking into little _RARE_ of two and three men as they approached the road
the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the _RARE_ who had been in the _RARE_ of the North Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we felt that if they employed this _RARE_ , it was likely enough the best one
said : `` It makes sense

it , and we broke into parties of two and three
_RARE_ decided to remain with the Reverend and poor _RARE_ _RARE_ until life passed away -- and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world
off with Cousin Simmons , who maintained that if he didn't see to me , he didn't know who would
_RARE_ , Adam '' , he said , `` I thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place ''
learned that now '' , I said
east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road , panting from the effort and _RARE_ with sweat
a _RARE_ of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road , and the shouting and gunfire never _RARE_
trees , there was a dead redcoat , a young boy with a _RARE_ white skin and a face full of _RARE_ , who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes
were around him
stripped him of his musket and equipment , and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off
grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away
name , what are you to _RARE_ the dead with the fight going on ''
roared
to _RARE_ him , but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men , and it would have taken _RARE_ men than these were to _RARE_ him
the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre _RARE_ , a _RARE_ manufacturer
no longer permitted in the streets
and other places of _RARE_ were _RARE_
_RARE_ had to go
no longer _RARE_
, a _RARE_ _RARE_ , Jake _RARE_ , _RARE_ down the _RARE_ in St. _RARE_ one Sunday morning , followed by one of the women from the _RARE_ , whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame
down on the front bench , they turned to _RARE_ at those around them
impulse was to _RARE_ their _RARE_
thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him
opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well
the worship service as if there had been no _RARE_ attempt to _RARE_ God and man
morning , as the clock struck nine , he appeared at the Council meeting in the _RARE_ Hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be respected
have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur _RARE_ said _RARE_
to the preaching of the _RARE_ ''
in anger
is the answer the _RARE_ will always make when the Church points its fingers at their _RARE_
to you that the Church will ever _RARE_ evil ''
was like a _RARE_ of war
sat down in his _RARE_ stall , lips compressed , eyes _RARE_
, a short man with a _RARE_ of stomach , rose
was on him as he began to speak
_RARE_ _RARE_ says is true
we have a good city unless we respect morality ''
, a tall man with _RARE_ cheeks and _RARE_ eyes , got to his feet
all know that Jake _RARE_ and the woman are _RARE_ living together
be well to show the _RARE_ how we deal with _RARE_ ''
, the son of the famous _RARE_ , _RARE_
not listen to that _RARE_
_RARE_ the liberty my father gave his life to win ''
quietly insistent
can be no _RARE_ when _RARE_ are in _RARE_ ''
later the sentence of the Council was carried out : Jake _RARE_ and the woman were _RARE_ naked through the streets past a _RARE_ _RARE_
stalked the _RARE_ , _RARE_ as he went , `` Thus the Council deals with those who break its laws -- _RARE_ , thieves , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ persons
_RARE_ their ways , and let every man _RARE_ ''
raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary
died two weeks before , in early November , without being _RARE_ to the Church
, in a body , had tried to force him on his _RARE_ to let them give him the last _RARE_ of the Church , but he had died still _RARE_ _RARE_ by faith
taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the _RARE_ , so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned
of St. _RARE_ , _RARE_ De _RARE_ , had been a good friend , but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in _RARE_ ground
his eyes and saw once again the little _RARE_ in his mother's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs
Virgin was still there , but no one knelt before her now
_RARE_ ; ; she , too , prayed only to God
instant John _RARE_ for the sound of the bells of _RARE_ , the touch of his mother's hand , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ voice in the square _RARE_ rooms , his father's _RARE_ tones _RARE_ to the _RARE_ , and the sight of the beloved _RARE_
had to follow the light
expected a man to believe the Holy _RARE_ , why had He given them to him
trees stood like _RARE_ in the February night
the streets and covered the _RARE_ _RARE_ , as John _RARE_ toward St. _RARE_
_RARE_ by , its dim lights _RARE_ through the gloom
wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow _RARE_ the holes of his shoes , his only ones , now _RARE_ with folded _RARE_
had recently given him a small salary , but it was not enough to supply even _RARE_
_RARE_ the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black _RARE_ _RARE_ by
_RARE_ _RARE_ and called out a _RARE_
he was to such men
several on the Council who tried to live like _RARE_
efforts , the problems seemed to grow _RARE_ all the time
steps , John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells
big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead _RARE_ , and on the smaller bell , the _RARE_ , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air
upon the stone _RARE_
back his black hair , _RARE_ it under his _RARE_ cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes
_RARE_ world rolled away to _RARE_ white _RARE_ ; ; above him the deep blue sky _RARE_ with stars
very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the _RARE_ , then down at the _RARE_ lights below
long , my Lord

never asked for an easy task , but I am weary of the _RARE_ ''
difficult these days
him
were frequent
through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter Robert , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , Martin _RARE_ , and even the _RARE_ Louis Du _RARE_
_RARE_ from Italy brought news of Peter Robert , who was now _RARE_ his Bible among the _RARE_ _RARE_
regularly from _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and Martin
Anthony and William to _RARE_ in and _RARE_
continued to find a bitter joy in _RARE_ images and tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church
it difficult , but he held him in check
was busy most of the time _RARE_ this girl and that
good looks made him a favorite with the ladies
instead of becoming the City of God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a _RARE_ place where all manner of vice _RARE_
in , _RARE_ the _RARE_ and rules in order to remain , and then _RARE_ them
, _RARE_ _RARE_ their trade , thieves _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ _RARE_
were truly _RARE_ _RARE_ for the simple _RARE_ of days gone by
the _RARE_ of the past and demanded : `` Are we going to allow the _RARE_ Pope , _RARE_ _RARE_ , to _RARE_ our liberty
oh why , doesn't he stick to preaching the _RARE_ , instead of _RARE_ in civic affairs , politics , _RARE_ , and social issues that are no concern of the Church ''
reply was always the same : `` Anything that affects _RARE_ is the concern of the Church
have _RARE_ ''
behind his eyes as he prayed and _RARE_ tonight
confusion cleared , he would not be coming here much longer
threat would become a reality , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his _RARE_
first , the _RARE_ grew until it sounded loud against the wind


he doing here at this hour
down the steps to meet the _RARE_ preacher , who had been one of the early _RARE_ in Paris

you
to _RARE_ you of a plot ''
above him , his face _RARE_

like a man grown old , he took _RARE_ hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little _RARE_ where a fire still burned
''
_RARE_
_RARE_ just paid me a visit
to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here
, _RARE_ and _RARE_ , are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council
to be a trap
the law : if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge , you will be _RARE_ ''
will be the subject ''
are to be accused of _RARE_ to _RARE_ the religious who remain loyal ''
fear _RARE_ in John
the fourth century a _RARE_ had raged over the person of Christ
refused to believe that He was the eternal _RARE_ of God were _RARE_ _RARE_
had come to _RARE_ , saying that he had been a _RARE_ of the Church of Rome and had been _RARE_ in Paris for his _RARE_ faith
to be appointed a preacher
_RARE_ had _RARE_ him , revealing he had never been a _RARE_ , but was an _RARE_ , afraid to state his faith , because he knew John _RARE_ had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death
had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now _RARE_ sought _RARE_

William agrees , we should insist on a public debate '' , he said at length
is more to the _RARE_
that the Lord's _RARE_ be administered here as it used to be , with _RARE_ bread
_RARE_ _RARE_ that we must do as we are ordered by the Council , _RARE_ only the word of God and stop _RARE_ in politics ''
was always the spirit with Christ ; ; matters such as _RARE_ or _RARE_ bread are _RARE_
remain a sovereign state
not yield to the demands of _RARE_ ''
played over _RARE_ flowing white _RARE_ and _RARE_ features
_RARE_ indicated that if I would _RARE_ , after you and William are _RARE_ , following the debate , I will be given a place of influence ''
was your reply to that ''
I would rather be _RARE_ with two such _RARE_ than be made the Chief _RARE_ ''
morning , as John entered the Place _RARE_ on his way to visit a sick refugee , he had a _RARE_ of danger
a group of men and dogs circled him
to run , but he knew that if he did , he would be lost
very still , his heart _RARE_ wildly
_RARE_ of the _RARE_ the _RARE_ brothers and _RARE_ _RARE_ shook their fists
you going to _RARE_ with the demands of _RARE_ ''
Jake called
''
with a big _RARE_ of a nose roared
''
his hand for silence
this : the _RARE_ will not yield to the demands of _RARE_ ''
shook a little
a stone
instant John was _RARE_
felt the side of his head , his fingers came away covered with blood
could duck , another stone struck him

him be now ''
, the _RARE_ manufacturer said , his little pig eyes _RARE_
have taught him a lesson ''
moved back and John started _RARE_ down the hill
him as he staggered forward
slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow
a _RARE_ of dogs was snapping and _RARE_ around him
more _RARE_ than the rest , _RARE_ , _RARE_ deep in his throat , his hair _RARE_
difficulty John _RARE_ to his feet and started to run , sweat _RARE_ down his face
the shelter of the tent -- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer _RARE_ -- Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the _RARE_ counter of boards laid across two beer _RARE_
, of course , no real need to _RARE_ everything
inch this way or that for the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ sugar , or the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ , or the condensed milk , or the _RARE_ , or the _RARE_ -- what could it mean
his own hands make the _RARE_ , anxious movement that , when rain falls and nobody comes , and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the _RARE_ , has been the _RARE_ of stall _RARE_ , forever
the gesture
its meaning
seen a dry , old , _RARE_ hand reach out , with that painful _RARE_ , to touch , to _RARE_ , to shift _RARE_ , some object worth a _RARE_
_RARE_ he had seen that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always died within him
occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be
face was his own
what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face
if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut _RARE_
was no need , he remembered , for his hand to reach out , for his face to show concern or _RARE_
nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came
was he assuming the role -- the gesture and the suffering
he _RARE_
he now taking the role -- the gesture and the suffering -- because it was the only way to _RARE_ his history and identity in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ of this land
Virginia
out of the tent at the company street
dripped on the freezing _RARE_ of the street
_RARE_ gray of the rain , he saw the stretching _RARE_ , low _RARE_ log _RARE_ , _RARE_ with mud , with _RARE_ a man would have to _RARE_ to get through , with _RARE_ of _RARE_ laid over _RARE_ or boards from _RARE_ _RARE_ , or fence rails , with _RARE_ _RARE_ of sticks and dried mud
of the hut across from him was _RARE_ by a beef barrel with ends knocked out
heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help
from that chimney rose as _RARE_ as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ back down along the _RARE_ canvas of the roof
door was a board with large , _RARE_ _RARE_ : home sweet home
the hut of Simms Purdew , the hero
were huddled in those _RARE_
the names of some
the faces of all , _RARE_ or _RARE_ , old or young , fat or thin , suffering or _RARE_ , sad or gay , good or bad
stood about his tent , _RARE_ each other , _RARE_ their _RARE_ , _RARE_ command or weather , he had studied their faces
had the need to understand what life _RARE_ behind the mask of flesh , behind the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_
looking at Simms Purdew , the only man in the world whom he hated , he had seen the heavy , _RARE_ , _RARE_ jaw open and close to _RARE_ the cruel , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and had seen the _RARE_ eyes go _RARE_ with whisky and _RARE_ , and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that _RARE_ creature
seeing , somehow , the face of a young boy , the boy Simms Purdew must once have been , a boy with _RARE_ hair , and blue eyes dancing with _RARE_ , and the boy mouth grinning _RARE_ among the _RARE_
moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die
suddenly opened to joy
that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms Purdew , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple
Purdew would turn to him and say : `` Adam , you know when I was a boy , it was a funny thing happened
you now '' -- If only Simms Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he remembered and told
be a sign for the _RARE_ , and he , Adam , would understand
Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the _RARE_ of whisky choking the air
the sign above the door of the hut : home sweet home
the figure of a man in a _RARE_ coming up the company street , with an _RARE_ of wood
_RARE_ James , the _RARE_ of Simms Purdew
the wood , carried the water , did the cooking , cleaning and _RARE_ , and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his _RARE_
the _RARE_ flow from the _RARE_
the _RARE_ fabric a dull _RARE_ , like metal
_RARE_ lowered his head , pushed aside the _RARE_ door of the hut , and was gone from sight
at the door and remembered that Simms Purdew had been _RARE_ the _RARE_ of _RARE_ for _RARE_ at _RARE_
was again empty
was _RARE_ off now , but the light was _RARE_
interest , Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him
_RARE_ of the street , and his spirit , moved a form
was _RARE_ in an army blanket , much _RARE_ , _RARE_ at the neck with a cord
the _RARE_ _RARE_ of blanket the feet moved in the mud
wore army shoes , in obvious _RARE_
was wrapped in a _RARE_ and on top of the _RARE_ rode a great _RARE_ across which a piece of _RARE_ had been flung
face stared straight ahead in the _RARE_
down the cheeks , gathered at the tip of the nose , and at the chin
was close enough now for him to see the nose _RARE_ to _RARE_ the drop _RARE_ there
stopped and one hand was _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ to scratch the nose
figure moved on
one of the _RARE_ women who had built their own _RARE_ down near the river
washing
this one
her because she was the one who , in a winter _RARE_ , on the edge of camp , had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly
o' _RARE_ , _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ in her soft _RARE_
o' _RARE_ ''
was Mollie
her Mollie the _RARE_ , and laughed
the street after her , Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket
not make out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose
_RARE_ was scratching her nose
ran _RARE_ in his head : Mollie the _RARE_ is scratching her nose in the rain
words fell into a pattern : `` Mollie the _RARE_ is scratching her nose , _RARE_ her nose in the rain
_RARE_ is scratching her nose in the rain ''
would not stop
again and again
_RARE_ in that pattern , in the repetition
thought he might weep
the matter with me ''
out loud
wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain
, what's the matter with me ''

had stored his stock in the great oak chest , locked the two big _RARE_ and secured the additional chain , tied the fly of the tent , and picked up the cash box , he moved up the _RARE_ street
_RARE_ the cash box into the hands of Jed _RARE_ , then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold
-- Then what
not know
closed on that prospect , as though fog had descended to _RARE_ out a valley
, in the dusk , he heard voices singing , muffled but strong
of the _RARE_ a group of men were huddled together , singing

to hear
the words : `` Rock of Ages , _RARE_ for me , Let me hide myself in _RARE_
water and the blood From _RARE_ _RARE_ side flow
thought : I am a Jew from _RARE_
standing there , he thought , in Virginia , in the _RARE_ dusk , in a _RARE_ _RARE_ that had belonged to another Jew
Jew , a young man too , had left that _RARE_ behind , in a rich house , and _RARE_ away
crossed the river which now , beyond the woods _RARE_ , was sliding _RARE_ under the mist
plunged into the dark woods beyond
died there
that man , that other young Jew , felt as he stood in the _RARE_ and heard other men , far away , singing together
of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ after _RARE_ , row after row , the thousands of _RARE_ , stretching away into the night
of the men , the _RARE_ thousands , _RARE_ in them
of Simms Purdew snoring on his bunk while _RARE_ James crouched by the _RARE_ , _RARE_ an _RARE_ for _RARE_ , and a wet log _RARE_
of Simms Purdew , who once had _RARE_ at the edge of a _RARE_ , a _RARE_ scream on his lips , and swung a _RARE_ musket like a _RARE_ to beat down the _RARE_ of Rebel _RARE_ about him
of Simms Purdew rising up , _RARE_ in _RARE_
the _RARE_ of pity _RARE_ through him , _RARE_ his very flesh
, lying in the _RARE_ , they did not know
not know who they were or know their own worth
pity for them his _RARE_ was gone
thought of _RARE_ _RARE_ standing in his rich house saying : `` God is tired of taking the blame
going to let _RARE_ take the blame for a while ''
of the old man laughing under the _RARE_ of the great _RARE_
: Only in my heart can I make the world hang together
from the _RARE_ necessary to enter the hut

evening -- that _RARE_ _RARE_ time when the _RARE_ _RARE_ warmth _RARE_ and a smell of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ everything -- Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk
on the couch reading ; ; Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away
, in white _RARE_ _RARE_ , her face intense and _RARE_ , had _RARE_ a few _RARE_ steps toward her father
_RARE_ walk -- walk '' , he said
gently , he shoved her behind toward Laura
-- making it halfway across the cottage floor
not a second , picking herself up and continuing her _RARE_ to Laura
took her gently and shoved her off again , toward Fritzie : Amy did not laugh -- this was work , concentration , achievement
few minutes she was making the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; soon she was _RARE_ around the house , _RARE_ her new skill
logic , a _RARE_ of optimism as _RARE_ as the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ that came through the window ( a _RARE_ perhaps _RARE_ by the pill Fritzie had given her ) , _RARE_ her for a moment
to be safe , had to come back to them -- if only to _RARE_ that share of _RARE_ experiences that were her due , if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her
_RARE_ of terror , she _RARE_ _RARE_ sharp point -- Amy would be _RARE_ , a new child , with new parents , living under new circumstances

on the _RARE_ with his coffee , _RARE_ his hands on the cup , although the room was heavy with heat
had little to say to each other
night's horror -- the absolute failure , overcast with the _RARE_ of the press , had left them all with a _RARE_ sense of _RARE_ , of _RARE_
coffee , discussing the weather , the day's shopping , _RARE_ _RARE_ at the network ( all of which he would _RARE_ ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news show , even the front page of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , resting on the kitchen bar

was halfway to the door , the _RARE_ emerged -- a _RARE_ , dark man , his head thick with _RARE_ black hair , his eyes like two of the black _RARE_ he _RARE_ in _RARE_
himself
of the house , his _RARE_ face _RARE_ , _RARE_ to _RARE_ his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective
as soon as Mr. _RARE_ had _RARE_ -- in a _RARE_ whisper -- the _RARE_ errand , his family gathered in a _RARE_ , forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a _RARE_ _RARE_ which stood at one side of a _RARE_ _RARE_
marble _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , they seemed to be _RARE_ for a _RARE_ _RARE_
amazing how they had _RARE_ together for protection : an enormous _RARE_ in a _RARE_ silk _RARE_ , rising from the breakfast table ; ; a gross boy in his _RARE_ , _RARE_ in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; ; a girl in her _RARE_ , fat and sullen , _RARE_ the marble staircase ; ; then all four gathering on the _RARE_ to face the _RARE_
him in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , _RARE_ the word from Papa , who _RARE_ cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white _RARE_ and burst off to the _RARE_
they hadn't seen anyone around ; ; no , they didn't know the Andrus family ; ; yes , they had read about the case ; ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no longer
no opinions , _RARE_ nothing , betrayed no emotions
, McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple
people seemed to him of that _RARE_ of human beings whose _RARE_ _RARE_ them from _RARE_
they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never _RARE_ ) , whose children had no unhappy _RARE_ , whose names never knew _RARE_
was simple : _RARE_ brought them happiness , and their _RARE_ front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no one in on the _RARE_
, Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering _RARE_
no outer _RARE_ , no hard shells of confidence ; ; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them
no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no move to _RARE_ _RARE_ to the door
remained _RARE_ on the _RARE_ until he had left
spoken to Mrs.
previous day
a family named Kahler , owners of a _RARE_ _RARE_ house on the south side of the Andrus home
had not come up in any discussions with Laura , and he had no idea what they would be like
the _RARE_ lawn and _RARE_ : each blade of grass _RARE_ , bright and firm ; ; each _RARE_ _RARE_ with good health
was answered by a slender man in his _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , somewhat _RARE_ in manner , wearing _RARE_ glasses
identified himself , he nodded , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ him into a _RARE_ living room
joined them
a _RARE_ quality -- a gray , lean woman , not _RARE_
dressed rather formally
wore a _RARE_ and a tie , the woman had on a dark green dress and three _RARE_ of _RARE_
thing '' , Mr. Kahler said , when they were seated , `` when I heard you ringing , I figured it was that guy down the block , _RARE_ ''
puzzled
: `` I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he's _RARE_ , so I expected him to come _RARE_ in ''
went on to explain how _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ had been `` making '' in his flower beds
refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small _RARE_
lay in wait in the garage , and when the _RARE_ came scratching around , he'd let fly with a _RARE_ bomb
the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned
hit him in the _RARE_ once ''
at the detective
, all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a _RARE_ and that dumb dog would run _RARE_ for his life ''
dim _RARE_ light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen
_RARE_ by the stove
the pilot light and turned on one of the _RARE_ for her
_RARE_ up two inches high
the _RARE_
water on to _RARE_ and then _RARE_ through the _RARE_
of a _RARE_ of dark bread ; ; butter ; ; _RARE_ ; ; a tiny _RARE_ of ice
search for what turned out to be the right breakfast _RARE_ but the wrong table silver , they opened every _RARE_ door in the kitchen and _RARE_
was settling the _RARE_ , he went back across the hall to their bedroom , opened one of the _RARE_ , and took out powdered coffee and sugar
with the _RARE_ and he opened the windows
you want to call Eugene ''
, but it was not really a question , and so he left the room , walked down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitated , and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study
voice answered
_RARE_ _RARE_ '' , Harold said , in an _RARE_ that did credit to Miss _RARE_ , his _RARE_ French teacher
same time , his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here , and _RARE_ an appeal to whatever is reasonable , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ in everybody
_RARE_ conversation was impossible , it was at least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread and butter , and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first
a _RARE_ of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water
he said : `` I am sorry that my work _RARE_ me from doing anything with you today ''
him that they did not expect or need to be _RARE_
a _RARE_ of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water , and then , stirring , he sat back in his chair
creaked
he moved or said something , the chair creaked again
not entirely silent , or openly _RARE_ -- unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the _RARE_ that creaked so _RARE_ was an act of _RARE_
right on _RARE_ under his own considerable weight , and all it needed , Harold thought , was for somebody to _RARE_ himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it
open window they heard sounds below in the street : _RARE_ , a tired _RARE_ _RARE_ step , voices
the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in
him and he promptly forgot
the _RARE_ , the bread , the _RARE_ butter , back and forth
said about hotels or train _RARE_
Harold his car , to use at any time he cared to , and when this offer was not accepted , the _RARE_ creaked
three had another cup of coffee
in his _RARE_ and dressing gown , and on his large feet he wore yellow _RARE_ _RARE_ that turned up at the toes
me '' , he said in _RARE_ English , and got up and left them , to _RARE_ and dress
shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall
that he had no idea where the telephone was
moment the bathroom door flew open and Eugene came out , with his face _RARE_ for _RARE_ , and strode down the hall , _RARE_ the _RARE_ of his dressing gown as he went
was in the study but the ringing came from the hall
telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was _RARE_ and in the tub
left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them
his head
called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said
wants you and _RARE_ to have dinner with her tomorrow night ''
Harold a key to the front door , and _RARE_ him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment
time had _RARE_ so that there was little _RARE_ of his returning for something he had forgotten , Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another
room next to theirs was a huge _RARE_ , of _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ with gold _RARE_
the most _RARE_ _RARE_ he had ever seen
their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , _RARE_ by the photographs on the walls , must belong to _RARE_ _RARE_
woman who looked like _RARE_ , with her two children
Eugene on their wedding day
in _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and an elderly man who must be _RARE_ _RARE_
, considerably younger and very different

_RARE_ man whose glance -- direct , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ -- was _RARE_ by the _RARE_ and black frame
the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person
, could it be
metal _RARE_ closed , the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there
the _RARE_ _RARE_ was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and _RARE_ , which seemed to be _RARE_ in brown or _RARE_ _RARE_
were of the same material , and there were some big oil paintings -- _RARE_ in the style of _RARE_ and _RARE_
taken individually , the big rooms were , or seemed to be , square , the apartment as a whole formed a _RARE_
, the study where Eugene slept , was light and bright and _RARE_ and _RARE_
looked out on the Place _RARE_ -- it was the only window of the apartment that did
slowly , he saw a marble _RARE_ , a desk , a low _RARE_ of _RARE_ with _RARE_ brass wire instead of glass _RARE_ in the doors
Eugene had slept in , made up now with its _RARE_ _RARE_ cover and _RARE_
record player with a pile of classical records beside it
was the one on top
could not be _RARE_ passion
the records were dusty
the doors of the _RARE_

he could read easily through the _RARE_ wires : works on _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , history , _RARE_ , political science


over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything
on the _RARE_ piece was _RARE_ and _RARE_ so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room
called out to them as they were passing through the _RARE_
were on the right as you walked into the building , and her small front room was _RARE_ with heavy furniture -- a big , round , oak dining table and chairs , a _RARE_ , with a row of _RARE_ letters inserted between the mirror and its frame
had come while they were out , and had been put in their room , the _RARE_ said
until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do ''
the _RARE_ , I guess ''
guess ''
sit around waiting for the _RARE_ to be delivered , they had gone _RARE_
to the _RARE_ _RARE_ , expecting to find the _RARE_ of Europe , and found instead a _RARE_ of that long double row of _RARE_ in _RARE_
and _RARE_ of every sort , as far as the eye could see
, even so
everything
some cotton _RARE_ , and Harold bought _RARE_
lunch at a sidewalk _RARE_ _RARE_ the intersection of two broad , busy , _RARE_ streets , and coming home they got lost in the _RARE_ ; ; it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed , in order to take the line that went to the Place _RARE_
the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the _RARE_
opened the door , there stood Eugene , on his way out of the apartment
wearing _RARE_ and shorts and an _RARE_ shirt , and in his hand he carried a little black bag
not explain where he was going , and they did not ask
they went on down the hall to their room
you think he could be having an affair ''
, as they heard the front door close
no '' , Harold said , shocked
, this is France , after all ''
know , but there must be some other explanation
spending the evening with friends ''
for that he needs a little bag ''
shopping in the neighborhood , and bought two _RARE_ of bread with the _RARE_ _RARE_ they had been given in _RARE_ , and some cheese , and a dozen eggs , and a bag of _RARE_ from a _RARE_ in the Place _RARE_ -- the first _RARE_ they had seen since they landed
_RARE_ , sitting in front of a _RARE_
got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and thought how , under different circumstances , they might have stayed on here , in these _RARE_ , _RARE_ rooms that reminded him of the _RARE_ apartment in the East _RARE_
have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days
down the hall to _RARE_ bathroom , to turn on the _RARE_ heater , and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming _RARE_
them
damp
out and felt the bath _RARE_ hanging on the _RARE_ rack over the tub

around the room and then called out : `` Come here , quick ''
is it ''
, standing in the doorway
solved the mystery of the little bag
is and there is what was in it
do people go swimming in Paris
in the river , maybe ''
boat ''
a big boat _RARE_ near the Place De La _RARE_ , with a swimming pool in it -- didn't you notice it
he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us ''
at him in surprise
know '' , he said , reading her mind
don't know what I'm going to do with you ''
because we are in France '' , he said , `` and know so few people
like this matters more than it would at home
he was so nice when he was nice ''
because I didn't feel like dancing ''
don't think it was that , really ''
what was it ''
don't know
I did
coat , maybe
about Eugene is that he's very proud ''
thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be
-- what about all those people Harold _RARE_ went toward _RARE_ , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other
the _RARE_ questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields
any case , answers may _RARE_ but they do not change anything
with him a mixture of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , of about a hundred _RARE_ weight
_RARE_ body , then , and wrapped it in _RARE_ with the _RARE_ ; ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial
present at the _RARE_ were Mary , Mary's sister , Mary _RARE_ , John , Joseph of _RARE_ , _RARE_
he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus
scene was crowded with _RARE_ , such as the dramatic _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ , where the _RARE_ _RARE_ had _RARE_ Mary's last _RARE_ moment
concept there could be no one else present
desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe
Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap
the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of _RARE_ was at _RARE_ _RARE_ asking for Christ's body , _RARE_ was gathering his mixture of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and the others had gone home to _RARE_
saw his finished _RARE_ would take the place of the _RARE_ witnesses
feel what Mary was undergoing
be no _RARE_ , no angels
be two human beings , whom God had chosen
close to Mary , having spent so long _RARE_ on the beginning of her journey
was intensely alive , _RARE_ ; ; her son was dead
he would later be _RARE_ , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross
sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; ; only what Mary felt for her son
body would be _RARE_ , his eyes closed
have to carry the human communication
right to him
a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems
Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming _RARE_
would be slender of _RARE_ and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this _RARE_ man as _RARE_ and _RARE_ as she would a child
only one way to accomplish this : by design , by drawing _RARE_ and sketches in which he _RARE_ the _RARE_ corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept
by making free sketches to _RARE_ up his thinking so that images would appear on paper
these _RARE_ what he was feeling within himself
same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the _RARE_ , _RARE_ up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved
he sought the gentle , _RARE_ _RARE_ , with head _RARE_ and _RARE_ coming to the middle of their _RARE_ , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper
_RARE_ could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of _RARE_
as he went along , _RARE_ a _RARE_ clay figure , then bought yards of an _RARE_ material from a _RARE_ , wet the _RARE_ cloth in a _RARE_ and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the _RARE_ , to the consistency of thick mud
could be _RARE_ , each turn of the _RARE_ had to serve _RARE_ , to cover the _RARE_ slender legs and feet so that they would give _RARE_ support to Christ's body , to _RARE_ her inner _RARE_
cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made
that's sculpture '' , _RARE_ Argiento _RARE_ , when he had _RARE_ down the floor for a week , `` making mud _RARE_ ''

, Argiento , if you control the way these _RARE_ are _RARE_ , like this , or made to flow , you can _RARE_ the body attitudes
have as much _RARE_ appeal as flesh and bone ''
into the Jewish quarter , wanting to draw _RARE_ faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked
section was in _RARE_ , near the _RARE_ at the church of San _RARE_ a _RARE_
had been small until the Spanish _RARE_ of _RARE_ drove many Jews into Rome
for the most part , they were well treated , as a `` _RARE_ of the Old _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ '' ; ; many of their _RARE_ members were prominent in the _RARE_ as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_
did not object to his _RARE_ them while they went about their work , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to _RARE_
told to ask for _RARE_ _RARE_ at the _RARE_ on Saturday afternoon
the _RARE_ in the room of study , a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous _RARE_ eyes , _RARE_ in black _RARE_ with a _RARE_ on his head
reading from the _RARE_ with a group of men from his _RARE_
explained why he had come , _RARE_ _RARE_ replied _RARE_ : `` The Bible _RARE_ us to bow down to or to make _RARE_ images
why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture ''
, _RARE_ _RARE_ , you don't object to others creating works of art ''
at all
has its own _RARE_ ''
am _RARE_ a _RARE_ from white _RARE_ marble
to make Jesus an authentic Jew
accomplish this if you will not help me ''
said thoughtfully , `` I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church ''
am working for the _RARE_ of San _RARE_
he would _RARE_ ''
kind of models would you prefer ''

_RARE_
_RARE_ , but _RARE_ men

''
smiled at him with _RARE_ old but _RARE_ eyes
me your address
send you the best the quarter has to offer ''
to _RARE_ solitary _RARE_ room with his sketches , asked the _RARE_ to design a stand which would _RARE_ the seated _RARE_
the drawings and _RARE_ a _RARE_ couch
some _RARE_ lumber
and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets
model arrived at dusk
for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to _RARE_ , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of _RARE_ to _RARE_ around his _RARE_ , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes
_RARE_ him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother's lap
quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; ; only the instructions from his _RARE_ kept him from _RARE_
the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother _RARE_ in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends
for two hours a day with each model sent by the _RARE_
quite a different problem
sculpture must take place _RARE_ years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her _RARE_ , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry
of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother
introduced him into several Roman homes
_RARE_ , sitting in their flowing _RARE_ of _RARE_ and silk , young girls not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two
_RARE_ _RARE_ hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; ; but he had _RARE_ the women of _RARE_ in their fields and homes
able to _RARE_ the body lines of the Roman women under their _RARE_
concentrated weeks putting his two figures together : a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of _RARE_ _RARE_
toward the composite design from his _RARE_ accurate memory , without need to _RARE_ his sketches
was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay
would have free expression because the material could be moved to _RARE_ forms
wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or _RARE_ clay
turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in _RARE_ quality and _RARE_
each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character : his _RARE_ drawings had a _RARE_ , suggesting skin _RARE_ ; ; the clay he used _RARE_ to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an _RARE_ , in a _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; the wax he _RARE_ over to give the body surface an _RARE_ pull
never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; ; they remained rough starting points
he was charged with spontaneous energy ; ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere _RARE_ of his model
_RARE_ had to be inside the marble itself
models were his thinking
action

with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who _RARE_
been trained so _RARE_ by the _RARE_ that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to _RARE_ the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing _RARE_ every day , the _RARE_ _RARE_ with river sand after each meal
, this is _RARE_ '' , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather
too clean
studio once a week
''
'' , said Argiento _RARE_
day

taught ''
God help anyone who _RARE_ to _RARE_ you ''
; ; yet he knew that he had nothing to _RARE_ about , for Argiento made few demands on him
was becoming _RARE_ with the _RARE_ families that brought produce into Rome
he would walk miles into the _RARE_ to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses
thing he missed from his farm in the _RARE_ Valley was the animals ; ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by _RARE_ : `` Today I go see the horses ''
a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him
crouched over his _RARE_ in the _RARE_ getting his _RARE_ into _RARE_ , when a _RARE_ of steel flew into his eye and _RARE_ itself in his pupil
into the house , eyes burning like fire
him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , _RARE_ some clean white _RARE_ cloth and applied it to _RARE_ the _RARE_
pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned
he could _RARE_ the _RARE_ out
would not come
left his side , keeping the water _RARE_ , applying hot _RARE_ throughout the night
second day Michelangelo began to worry ; ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the _RARE_ eye
Argiento went to _RARE_ _RARE_
with his family surgeon , _RARE_ _RARE_
carried a _RARE_ of live _RARE_
Argiento to take a bird out of the _RARE_ , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood _RARE_ into _RARE_ injured eye
came back at dusk , cut the vein of a second _RARE_ , again washed out the eye
very still and her breath came in small _RARE_ _RARE_
legs _RARE_ _RARE_ once , then Kate felt the little body _RARE_ in her arms and heard one _RARE_ sound
flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands
was gone
awoke , Kate was still _RARE_ the dead child , still _RARE_ in _RARE_ , `` No , no , oh , no
put Kate to bed and _RARE_ _RARE_ and sent for the young _RARE_ minister
beside _RARE_ bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God's will , while Kate lay staring _RARE_ at him
told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words _RARE_
the neighbors came , but Mrs. _RARE_ came , called by _RARE_
always comes in _RARE_ '' , she sighed heavily
never comes but in _RARE_ ''
the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and _RARE_ the little box in the quiet family plot
through all the preparations and services in a state of _RARE_
not accept the death of such a little child
called her to Him '' , the minister had said
not do that , Kate thought _RARE_
came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself
panic of grief she accepted _RARE_ _RARE_ , and believed in her _RARE_ that she had been cursed by God
_RARE_ letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were _RARE_
nothing left but her duty to his land and his son
and sat _RARE_ with her , sharing her pain and _RARE_ , _RARE_ his eyes from the ice _RARE_ on her bosom
Mrs. _RARE_ kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried
returned to life in the big house she felt _RARE_ of all emotion save _RARE_ to duty
herself daily to do what must be done
even _RARE_ herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the _RARE_ room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate _RARE_ of the baby's death
about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss Juanita _RARE_ '' , bearing a _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ hand , Kate knew _RARE_ that it was from the _RARE_ colonel
forces had taken _RARE_ and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ and were moving to take all the mountains
to contain her curiosity and _RARE_ at what the letter _RARE_ , at what _RARE_ existed for Juanita
and Joel had _RARE_ the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including _RARE_ , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp
like a field hand in the afternoons after school
been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from _RARE_ Ferry
she had deserted the boy in her own loss
him and missed his company
had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own
was Kate could not _RARE_
to be visiting the _RARE_ saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his _RARE_ , but Kate had not smelled _RARE_ on him since Mrs. _RARE_ funeral
what he was about , however
gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the _RARE_ one morning
this old _RARE_ '' , chuckled Uncle Randolph
knows I'm just a _RARE_ , _RARE_ old man who takes to drink
to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure ''
still , my foot '' , said Joel
back there riding with the guerrillas , the _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
'' , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , `` or I'll give you another black eye ''
the eye Joel had had _RARE_ in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back
no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the _RARE_ at night , had heard _RARE_ on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn
Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a _RARE_ _RARE_ to his saddle , _RARE_ singing `` Old Dan _RARE_ '' at the top of his voice
voice ring _RARE_ up from the road , Kate would _RARE_ him anxiously and watch _RARE_ as he walked into the house , cold sober
was about became clear to her with the _RARE_ of another _RARE_ proclamation by General _RARE_ , threatening _RARE_ against Rebel guerrillas
taken up in worry for the _RARE_ old man
more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work
taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss _RARE_ crack Joel across the face with a _RARE_ for letting a snake loose in the _RARE_
walked past the school on her morning _RARE_ and had seen the whole incident , had seen _RARE_ burning _RARE_ before Miss _RARE_ cold , _RARE_ _RARE_
the _RARE_ _RARE_ of growing before him now , as he approached twelve
be his _RARE_ years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately
to find some way to draw him out , to help him
found time , she went _RARE_ picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths _RARE_ , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day
the new _RARE_ _RARE_ had _RARE_
Kate and Juanita _RARE_ the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still _RARE_ watching the last fat bees working against the _RARE_ _RARE_ dusk
went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph
in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the _RARE_ , bringing the news
grimly of the destruction of _RARE_ Ferry before they _RARE_ it ; ; of their first engagement at _RARE_ _RARE_ after Old Jack's First _RARE_ had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B & O _RARE_
were _RARE_ , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished
came _RARE_ his _RARE_ and told them of the _RARE_ in _RARE_ , Which had formed a new state government by _RARE_ the government at _RARE_ in the east _RARE_ because they were _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at _RARE_ and _RARE_ mountains both , and the Federal _RARE_ on _RARE_
all them _RARE_ _RARE_ the hills , they did
never _RARE_ over _RARE_ loyal western Virginia , them _RARE_
is making everybody take the _RARE_ of _RARE_ around these parts too '' , he _RARE_
had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , `` Would you take their _RARE_ ''
old man had given a _RARE_ and _RARE_ laugh and said , `` Hell , yes
I've taken it about fifty times already ''
_RARE_ look of shock
wrote Kate of her grief at the death of _RARE_ baby and at _RARE_ decision to go with the South `` And , dear Kate '' , she wrote , `` poor Dr. _RARE_ son Robert is now _RARE_ a _RARE_ company to go South , to his good father's _RARE_
of Fort _RARE_ is home and _RARE_ volunteers for the U.S. Army
of the fact that the state _RARE_ voted us neutral , John _RARE_ Morgan is openly flying the _RARE_ flag over his _RARE_ factory ''
a big battle spread like a _RARE_ up the valley
_RARE_ at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to _RARE_ for the news
_RARE_ know down _RARE_ is it were at _RARE_ _RARE_ and it were a big fight '' , the old man told them
next few days they had cause to _RARE_
been a big battle , and the _RARE_ forces had won
Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing
Mrs. _RARE_ waited for letters anxiously
to the _RARE_ of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory _RARE_ to _RARE_
hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the _RARE_
prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had _RARE_ her land _RARE_
after _RARE_ the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an _RARE_ rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window
already lost most of their corn , she thought
to be _RARE_ again because of the _RARE_ great victory
_RARE_ last proclamation as she hurried _RARE_ down the stairs
landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door
just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth
came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel _RARE_ framed in the doorway , his face set in the same _RARE_ look Juanita wore
him _RARE_ , uneasy with _RARE_ at his visit
brings you here again , Colonel _RARE_ ''
, taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the _RARE_ were closed against the afternoon sun
stopped to say _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby
our doctor could have saved her ''
was a terrible loss to me '' , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain _RARE_ again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at _RARE_
will you go now that you're leaving _RARE_ ''
him , seeing _RARE_ eyes grow _RARE_
you know , General _RARE_ has been _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the _RARE_
to go to Washington to serve with him ''
are you to leave ''
, watching them both now anxiously
betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly

permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs. _RARE_ ''
here in the parlor where it's cool '' , she said , trying to be calm
be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs. _RARE_ not to see them
back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations
took _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ young _RARE_ where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden
called to his _RARE_ and the pair rode off down the River Road where the _RARE_ burned blue , Juanita was _RARE_ and trying not to cry
Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling
wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told Kate
do you want to do ''
, uneasy at the _RARE_ of the girl's dilemma
could go with him
me as your _RARE_ , which , of course , I am
am a slave
me
decision '' , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she _RARE_ her words too distinctly
, the decision is yours
held your papers of _RARE_ since I married Mr. _RARE_ ''
glow from the _RARE_ had died out of the sky
in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more
left _RARE_ they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the _RARE_ _RARE_
out the remaining _RARE_ with a long _RARE_ , and in the smell of _RARE_ _RARE_ , the comforting awareness of each _RARE_ bodies , the retained pattern of _RARE_ and guests remembered , their minds grew _RARE_ and then empty of images
-- _RARE_ with a _RARE_ _RARE_ snoring , the damn _RARE_ ivory teeth watching him from a _RARE_ table
_RARE_ below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows
a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of _RARE_ black and the stars _RARE_ the _RARE_ sky
, old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best _RARE_ black silk , her _RARE_ shoe _RARE_ held forward
, I'm here at last '' , she said , _RARE_ the old _RARE_ on the walls
don't hear the music
getting _RARE_ , I must admit it ''
to the _RARE_ and stood on the two _RARE_ steps that led down to it
is everyone
, where is everyone
you _RARE_ , you've forgot to order the _RARE_ ''
there , a large old woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son
times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations
a birthday ball
had reached his majority at eighteen
it her own first ball as _RARE_ of this big house , a _RARE_ _RARE_ bride from way _RARE_ near _RARE_ , from _RARE_
handsome _RARE_ , staring and _RARE_ , was he her _RARE_
up the _RARE_ of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a _RARE_ _RARE_ around the _RARE_
was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh
_RARE_ hard from Boston , and he was not used to _RARE_
driving the horse and _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ , he felt as if every bone was _RARE_ by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to _RARE_ into _RARE_ and leave his big body helpless and unable to move
leading south along the river was _RARE_ with old trees , and in the moonlight the _RARE_ landscape was like a setting for _RARE_ and wood _RARE_ rather than the Hudson River Valley of his _RARE_ _RARE_

cross to Manhattan , to _RARE_ _RARE_ , before morning

would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , of _RARE_ wars
everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long
Sir _RARE_ , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right _RARE_ along to the bay past fish _RARE_ and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of _RARE_ road
was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a _RARE_ and _RARE_ grace
was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads
for the pair of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ at his feet
out one of them and _RARE_ it
wood creature came _RARE_ up from a patch of _RARE_ _RARE_
a _RARE_ hen , five or six feet tall
the features of a man _RARE_ by _RARE_ of loose feathers
, this _RARE_ _RARE_ , on two thin legs , and its wings -- were they _RARE_ arms

_RARE_ at the _RARE_ thing and _RARE_ its _RARE_

in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , _RARE_ with an insane fear
bird thing ran away , and to David its _RARE_ sounded like the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ _RARE_
was gone
on , _RARE_ and _RARE_
were out tonight
New York lay _RARE_ in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long _RARE_ _RARE_ of Manhattan Island
_RARE_ settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into _RARE_ streets , mostly around the _RARE_ , going _RARE_ north to _RARE_ Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of _RARE_ _RARE_

ships were near _RARE_ _RARE_ , already being called , by a few , Jersey City

_RARE_ of the _RARE_ becoming _RARE_ to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls _RARE_ painted yellow and black , the _RARE_ _RARE_ at the _RARE_
_RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ was being _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_
`` the _RARE_ slaves to _RARE_ '' -- the town _RARE_ -- watched the ships and waited

_RARE_ in _RARE_ County , past the white church at _RARE_ , past _RARE_ Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white _RARE_ roads of the Long Island _RARE_ there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something _RARE_ to happen
tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight
ships rolled at _RARE_ , sent out _RARE_ boats and waited for orders from London
more ships , more _RARE_ _RARE_ , and asked what was to be done with a war of _RARE_
, having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the _RARE_ River near _RARE_ _RARE_
out through _RARE_ turned a faint _RARE_ by sun and weather , looked out at _RARE_ Bridge toward _RARE_
seemed _RARE_ with a few more wagons than usual ; ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local _RARE_ company _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old _RARE_ , or _RARE_
events of the last few days _RARE_ _RARE_ mind and he rubbed his _RARE_ chin and felt again the _RARE_ in his _RARE_ caused by his saddle _RARE_ from Boston
_RARE_ , he _RARE_
sent the _RARE_ downtown to the proper people and had slept
was more to do
written down had to be _RARE_ to the local _RARE_ government
his _RARE_ neck
_RARE_ , hung on a _RARE_ chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John _RARE_
_RARE_ water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he _RARE_ his face and stood _RARE_ the razor on his broad leather belt , its _RARE_ held firm by a _RARE_ of the _RARE_
he was free of _RARE_
was , suddenly caught up in the _RARE_ of a war , in the spite and _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_
be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war
had certain _RARE_ _RARE_ that this _RARE_ was not wholly what it appeared on the surface
that many were using it for their own ends
did not matter
the razor slowly ; ; what _RARE_ was that a new concept of Americans was being born
men did not want it he could understand
_RARE_ of _RARE_ made them loyal usually to their _RARE_
, like _RARE_ _RARE_ , would _RARE_ themselves for the new ideas
would test us all , he decided
_RARE_ would occur
John _RARE_ would do well now ; ; war was a _RARE_ heaven
of that poor _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ he had seen on the road driving down from _RARE_
that would increase rather than be done away with
to believe in final events or one was _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of nothing
with John _RARE_ now that the _RARE_ of man was a dream
a short play of _RARE_ shadows
to _RARE_ with great _RARE_ _RARE_
an essential part in our _RARE_ , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine ( or admit ) the image of _RARE_ laughing filled his mind -- so desirable , so _RARE_ , so full of _RARE_ of pleasure and joy
_RARE_ patterns off , carefully _RARE_ his long upper lip
harder , he muttered , to _RARE_ on man ( or woman ) than on God
_RARE_ , washed his face clean of _RARE_ , and _RARE_ and _RARE_ his hair
proud that he had never worn a _RARE_
more of the _RARE_ were wearing their own hair and not using powder
_RARE_ again , _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ in his _RARE_ brown suit , the _RARE_ riding boots
so easy to _RARE_ sentiment
meadow below , _RARE_ officers shouted at their men and on _RARE_ Bridge two boys sat fishing
would happen ; ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much
could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days
to pack the _RARE_
this too shall pass away : it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy -- yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the _RARE_ Hudson Valley , where a feeling of _RARE_ was normal in those _RARE_ _RARE_ with their _RARE_ _RARE_
men and wrinkled women in _RARE_ black _RARE_ carried on in a primitive way , almost _RARE_ from _RARE_ times
Andrei
how they could go on in poverty , _RARE_ , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives _RARE_
a _RARE_ meeting long ago
had returned from the _RARE_ in _RARE_ and , before the national leadership , _RARE_ the _RARE_ of drying up _RARE_ and _RARE_ the _RARE_
drive to buy _RARE_ and machinery was launched
that his own reaction had been one of indifference
found the meaning too late
him
of the Lublin _RARE_ was rich , but no one seemed to care
_RARE_ land in _RARE_ _RARE_ broke their backs pushing will power to the _RARE_
sat beside Alexander _RARE_ at the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ of _RARE_
them were there in this loosely _RARE_ association of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and each _RARE_ the other and beat his breast for his own approaches
_RARE_ rose to speak , the hall became silent
do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of _RARE_
here because all our _RARE_ travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity
forest all our _RARE_ _RARE_ into a single great highway which ends in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ hills of _RARE_
our singular goal
travel through the forest is for each man's conscience
end our journey is always the same
seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and _RARE_ _RARE_ which will continue to _RARE_ us until the _RARE_ of David _RARE_ over _RARE_ ''
how Alexander _RARE_ expressed pure _RARE_
sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it
heart he had no desire to go to _RARE_
the idea of drying up _RARE_ or the _RARE_ of _RARE_ or of leaving his natural _RARE_
went into battle Andrei had told Alex , `` I only want to be a _RARE_
my city , not _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief

the _RARE_ eyes of the _RARE_ Army chief , Roman , and all the _RARE_ and the faces of the _RARE_ who held only hatred for him
let this black hole of death in _RARE_ heart exist without a cry of protest
had been big _RARE_ rooms where _RARE_ _RARE_ and kissed the _RARE_ hands as they _RARE_ from behind their fans

by their appearance that they were _RARE_
toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka
the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most
were all gone
the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto
moment of the occupation Lublin became a _RARE_ point
_RARE_ watched it carefully
was the _RARE_ of what would happen elsewhere
_RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , established _RARE_ headquarters for all of Poland
ran a check on _RARE_ and had only to conclude that he was in a _RARE_ of war with Hans Frank and the civilian _RARE_

of a massive _RARE_ in the _RARE_ to hold several million Jews A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of the guards at _RARE_ camps struck a _RARE_ of terror at the mere mention of their names

spring of 1942 _RARE_ _RARE_ began in Lublin
, a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , was _RARE_ into the camp in the _RARE_ _RARE_ called Majdanek
camp _RARE_ , it was _RARE_ by a _RARE_ of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by _RARE_ from outside Poland
in and in they poured through the _RARE_ of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger
happening in Majdanek
_RARE_ the same pattern for the daily _RARE_ now leaving the _RARE_ in Warsaw
another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected
at _RARE_ Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings
told him he was still early
_RARE_ he could see a portion of the ghetto wall
an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him
was filled with black _RARE_ uniforms and the dirty _RARE_ ones of their _RARE_
_RARE_ ''
up over the top of the paper and looked into the _RARE_ , homely face of Sergeant Styka
beside him and _RARE_ his hand excitedly
have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn
you might get in on a morning train ''
good to see you again , Styka ''
his captain
broke into tears
, Andrei _RARE_ had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer
was thin and _RARE_ and his beautiful boots were worn and _RARE_
to call me _RARE_ '' , Andrei said
and _RARE_ and blew his nose _RARE_
that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war ''
lucky that you were still living in Lublin ''
about fate
a time I thought of trying to reach the _RARE_ Polish Forces , but one thing led to another
a girl in trouble and we had to get married
bad girl
have three children and responsibilities
at the _RARE_
the old days in the army , but I get by

I tried to reach you , but I never knew how
to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall '' `` I understand ''
his nose again
you able to make the arrangements ''

is a man named _RARE_ who is the _RARE_ in charge of the _RARE_ at Majdanek
exactly as instructed
him you are on orders from the _RARE_ Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in _RARE_ in London ''
answer ''
thousand _RARE_ ''
he be trusted ''
is aware he will not live for _RARE_ hours if he _RARE_ you ''
man , Styka ''
_RARE_ must you go inside Majdanek
Everyone really knows what is happening there ''
everyone , Styka ''
good will it really do ''
don't know
there is a _RARE_ of conscience left in the human race
they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation ''
you really believe that , _RARE_ ''
have to believe it ''
his head slowly
am only a simple soldier
think things out too well
was transferred into the _RARE_ _RARE_ I was like every other _RARE_ in my feeling about Jews
you when I first came in
captain might have been a Jew , but he wasn't a Jew
mean is , he was a _RARE_ and the greatest soldier in the _RARE_
sir
of our company had a dozen _RARE_ defending your name
knew about it , but by God , we taught them respect for Captain _RARE_ ''

the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years

can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see ''
we are neither blind nor insane
of your company would not allow your name _RARE_
we let the Germans do this ''
have sat many hours with this , Styka
ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country
faith , Styka
to love this country and believe that _RARE_ we'd win our battle for _RARE_
I think I hate it very much ''
do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do ''
frightened Andrei
don't go inside Majdanek ''
still a soldier in a very small way , Styka ''
an answer that Styka understood
was beyond the bridge over the River _RARE_ near the rail center
in a _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before _RARE_
a square brick of a man with a _RARE_ face and _RARE_ Polish features
around the bowl of _RARE_ in which he _RARE_ thick black bread
it dripped down his chin
it down with beer and produced a _RARE_ _RARE_
''

at the pair of them
a sort of `` yes '' answer
cousin works at the Labor Bureau
make you work papers
take a few days
get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew
know if I can get you into the inner camp
, maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a _RARE_ we are building ''
his way to the bottom of the _RARE_ bowl
understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that _RARE_ place ''
from the _RARE_ Army ''

but Jews ''

get strange orders ''
-- what about the money ''
off five _RARE_ notes
never seen so much money
flat fingers , _RARE_ into massive _RARE_ by years of _RARE_ , snatched the bills _RARE_
ain't enough ''
get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek ''
ain't taking no _RARE_ chances for no Jew business ''
Styka were silent
getting real dramatic
been more impressed if I hadn't remembered that she'd played _RARE_ _RARE_ in her _RARE_ _RARE_ course
want her back on that broken record
free in the whole _RARE_ world '' , was all I could think of to say
delivered myself of that _RARE_ there was nothing to do but order up another drink
am '' , she said
all about Thelma and the Kentucky _RARE_ and how it was _RARE_ fifty dollars I was spending
just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to _RARE_ her neck because she was so _RARE_ but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch
sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me
crazy about her all over again
the call of the wild all right
turned out to be hell like all the others
down Broadway from _RARE_ to _RARE_
the same old routine
to dancing , just a little tiny dancing step to a _RARE_ tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd pull herself together and talk so _RARE_ in that sweet _RARE_ voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together and there I was back on the _RARE_
have the _RARE_ to call up Thelma and tell her I'd met old friends and would be home late
could scratch her eyes out '' , Eileen cried and _RARE_ her foot when I came back from the phone _RARE_
know I don't like my men to have other women
it
it ''
so drunk I had to take her home
a walk up on Hudson Street
about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go
a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table
_RARE_ of some kind of hair lotion these _RARE_ characters use
about _RARE_ ''
to shake her to make her listen

him ''
was very mysterious and dramatic
and I allow each other absolute freedom
above being _RARE_
to me bringing home strange men
tell him you're my husband
object to that ''
I object
_RARE_ his nose in here I'll _RARE_ him ''
really would be funny ''
to laugh
still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed
I'm made of flesh and blood
a plaster saint
was _RARE_
my life have I felt so _RARE_ about anything I've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife
had _RARE_
she couldn't lift her head from the _RARE_
under the covers making _RARE_ motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the _RARE_
_RARE_ in my _RARE_ trying to find my way around her damn _RARE_ when I _RARE_ that _RARE_ sweet _RARE_ smell
somebody else in the apartment

could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a _RARE_ that is going to get into a fight
around with the _RARE_ in my hand
were so _RARE_ I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth _RARE_ guy in a new spring _RARE_ and a _RARE_ _RARE_
, _RARE_ _RARE_
without an expression in the world
have time to speak before _RARE_ voice was screeching at us from the bed
_RARE_ _RARE_ meet _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ ''
the _RARE_ laugh I ever heard
don't either of you forget that I'm not any man's property
want to fight , go down on the sidewalk ''
enjoying the situation

a _RARE_ all right
wanting to _RARE_ the poor bastard I found myself having a _RARE_ for him
felt the same way
felt such a _RARE_ _RARE_ in my life
I knew he was in the _RARE_ cooking up the breakfast and I was _RARE_ Eileen her _RARE_ and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her _RARE_
face Thelma after that night
even have the nerve to call her on the telephone
her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express
I had to give her _RARE_ address , but she never came near us
did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it _RARE_ but that now life had _RARE_ our ways and it was _RARE_ forever
said a word about the fifty dollars
a _RARE_ begging me to be careful about drinking
know that that was my greatest weakness _RARE_ three times
learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away
me with Thelma
to _RARE_ all the drama out of a situation
I was _RARE_ up with Eileen in that _RARE_ fourth floor attic on Hudson Street
the phrase _RARE_ because there was something _RARE_ _RARE_ about our relationship
it and it ate on me all the time , but I didn't know how right I was till later
did know was that Precious was always around
in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs
do you think _RARE_ the rent
have me throw the poor boy out on the street '' , Eileen said when I _RARE_ her about it
sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention
a wonderful way of not listening to things she didn't want to hear
didn't think she was _RARE_ me with Precious right then
on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night
me worried
make out what his _RARE_ was
him a _RARE_ or _RARE_ but he didn't seem to be
smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his _RARE_ manner
let Eileen treat him like a _RARE_
place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work
could find out what his business was
seemed to have money in his pocket
had been _RARE_ but _RARE_ came for him and notes by special _RARE_
then he would _RARE_ for several days
'' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions
he's just an international _RARE_ '' , Eileen would shout with her _RARE_ laugh
he can't have been too happy either
no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he'd leave it on the table _RARE_
was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess
I pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel _RARE_ _RARE_ would show through that smooth face of his
day '' , I told Eileen , `` that guy will kill us both ''
wouldn't listen
every night was the only way I could handle the situation
to feel the same way
had that much in common
was drinking cost money
Eileen and I were _RARE_ it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening
have _RARE_ a little out of Precious
some _RARE_ by _RARE_ the good clothes I had left over from my respectable _RARE_ life , but when that was gone I didn't have a cent
know what we would have done if Pat _RARE_ hadn't come to town
looked like a heavier Jim
the same bullet head of _RARE_ _RARE_ hair but he didn't have _RARE_ _RARE_ humor or his brains or his charm
a big thick _RARE_ violent man
may have been a _RARE_ and a _RARE_ , but he was a good _RARE_ _RARE_ and he loved his little sister
had that _RARE_ _RARE_ that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything
Eileen and me out to dinner at a _RARE_ _RARE_ house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again
God _RARE_ joined '' _RARE_
were real religious people except for Kate
would be up to me to keep the little girl out of _RARE_
been worried as hell ever since she'd lost her job on that fashion magazine
gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art And _RARE_
me trying to help her get her job back
Eileen had been as _RARE_ as a little girl getting ready for her first _RARE_
about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with
brother I can't take a job right now '' , she said with her eyes on her ice _RARE_ , `` I'm going to have a baby , _RARE_ _RARE_ baby , my own husband's baby ''
thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks
was _RARE_ over with sentiment
that ever happened
really would have to settle down to love honor and _RARE_ , and she'd have to quit drinking
East for the _RARE_ , by God he would
separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into _RARE_ hand to help towards a _RARE_
left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job
contacts all over the labor movement
of _RARE_ named Frank _RARE_ had just _RARE_ into the _RARE_ Union
were retired _RARE_ and small time _RARE_ off _RARE_ and _RARE_ who acted as _RARE_ on the _RARE_
them were elderly men
responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the _RARE_ is awful in the _RARE_ of New York
as well paid as they should have been
the _RARE_ let _RARE_ take them over was to get the protection of his _RARE_
a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the _RARE_ local
was a retired _RARE_ and structural iron worker who'd never _RARE_ a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement
_RARE_ was a recommendation
wait to get me hired
gray hair and my _RARE_ _RARE_ I certainly looked the honest working stiff
a man will do for a woman
one fact which Rector could not _RARE_ , one truth which he could not deny
as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave
how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never _RARE_ that one _RARE_ of pride that gave him definition as an individual
the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord's servants
only natural that Fletcher would _RARE_ for a position in which he could make the decisions
himself was _RARE_ to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more _RARE_ office in the _RARE_ of the church -- his _RARE_ for the _RARE_ had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel
not sure how much of this desire was due to his _RARE_ to the church and how much was his own ego , _RARE_ to be satisfied , for the two were _RARE_ and could not be separated
desperately to see Kayabashi _RARE_ , the _RARE_ in the village _RARE_ out , the mission standing _RARE_ , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be _RARE_ , too
this was a part of the eternal plan , that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , _RARE_ force for good in the world

it was to try to _RARE_ the truth in an area where only faith would _RARE_
have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed
move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days
had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had _RARE_ _RARE_ or whether Hino was simply _RARE_ against the _RARE_ work in the print shop , using the _RARE_ in his arm as an excuse
event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning
_RARE_ at the prospect
allowed to spend his nights at an _RARE_ near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the _RARE_ parlor -- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy
with all the _RARE_ spirit of a child going on a holiday , _RARE_ _RARE_ as Rector gave him his final instructions
to get involved in no _RARE_ ; ; he was to try to make no _RARE_ ; ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard
a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , _RARE_ _RARE_ , openly _RARE_ , would make a poor _RARE_ agent
wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it _RARE_ , but in this _RARE_ manner he would probably receive more _RARE_ answers than if he tried to get them by _RARE_
of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a _RARE_ quite like Hino
moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job -- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand -- he had been ready to become a Christian
already been studying the Bible ; ; he knew the _RARE_ , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be _RARE_ and that was that
never been able to find out much about _RARE_ past
very little about himself except for the _RARE_ times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject
pieces of this _RARE_ together , Rector had the vague _RARE_ of a _RARE_
the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in _RARE_ , and divided his life between the land and the sea , _RARE_ the marginal _RARE_ on his small _RARE_ farm with _RARE_ employment on a fishing boat
_RARE_ brothers turned to either one or both of their father's _RARE_ , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired _RARE_ and proved _RARE_ popular as a _RARE_
gone into the Japanese _RARE_ , had been trained as an officer , had _RARE_ in one or two _RARE_ -- he never went into detail regarding his military experience -- and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a _RARE_ out of the blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian
often curious ; ; often _RARE_ to ask questions but he never did
when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so _RARE_
no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to _RARE_ it with his customary _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ with his active _RARE_
telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some _RARE_ of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few _RARE_ in the village and the phone in _RARE_ office rarely rang unless it was important
surprised to find _RARE_ secretary on the other end of the line
even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted
was _RARE_ a group of _RARE_ , the secretary said , _RARE_ from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission
never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it
''

guess it will be all right
the _RARE_ like to bring his guests up here ''
afternoon '' , the secretary said
three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time ''
right '' , Rector said
will be expecting them ''
about to hang up the phone , but a note of _RARE_ in the _RARE_ voice left the conversation open
something more to say
beg to _RARE_ if the back is now safe for _RARE_ '' , he said
despite himself
the _RARE_ has been working on it '' , he said , then checked himself and added : `` You can tell _RARE_ that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use ''
_RARE_ ''
sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in _RARE_ hand
no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission
_RARE_ to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter
feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily _RARE_ by the people in the village
same time , it was unlikely that any _RARE_ would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity
Kayabashi was bringing his _RARE_ here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to _RARE_ it until they arrived
had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. _RARE_ to prepare tea and _RARE_ for the visitors , using the formal English _RARE_ and the silver tea service which had been _RARE_ to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds
a pile of _RARE_ near one side of the lawn
him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be _RARE_ _RARE_
initial impression would be important now
into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press
many _RARE_ do we have in stock ''

should say about a hundred thousand '' , Fletcher said
''
would like to _RARE_ a little _RARE_ this afternoon '' , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission
not wish to _RARE_ Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a _RARE_ and impressive manner
as he listened to the instructions and said he would _RARE_ the things Rector _RARE_
stop was at the _RARE_ , where _RARE_ was _RARE_ a test
to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside
her of the visitors and then of his plans
many children do you have present today ''

back toward the _RARE_
'' , she said
, only fourteen
_RARE_ girl had had to go home
a pretty bad cold ''
would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but _RARE_ , _RARE_ , full of life
to create the impression of a compound full of children
think you can manage it ''

try ''
was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him
in the coffee house had done little to _RARE_ his spirits , but he was still a little _RARE_ around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident
think I've fixed the _RARE_ so we won't have to worry about it for a long time '' , he said
adjusted the gauge so that the _RARE_ cuts out before the water gets too low
_RARE_ '' , Rector said
out over the _RARE_ of the compound
going to take a lot of activity to fill it
you ever operated a transit ''

, sir '' , Johnson said
are about to become a _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , Rector said
_RARE_ gets back with the _RARE_ , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys
help you
an old transit in the basement
is out of it , but that won't matter
pretty efficient and that's the important thing ''
on to explain what he had in mind

he could do it
_RARE_ to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall
rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much
not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it
not going to lose the mission by _RARE_ , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little _RARE_ group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise
_RARE_ in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here
had been done , Rector went back to his desk to _RARE_ himself with his monthly report until three o'clock
thirty he sent _RARE_ to the top of the wall at the _RARE_ corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first _RARE_ the approach of _RARE_ party
, _RARE_ in his best blue _RARE_ suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting
was _RARE_ here , and the _RARE_ pattern of the trees threw a _RARE_ shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant
by asking him to name another hour should this one be _RARE_
took the _RARE_
that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of _RARE_ , he would be at home at the hour mentioned
she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new _RARE_
told by the _RARE_ who opened the door that his _RARE_ was engaged on work from which he had left _RARE_ orders he was not to be disturbed
bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the _RARE_ _RARE_ her purpose
again and now , _RARE_ for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career
act and she could write
was concerned in the management of _RARE_ _RARE_ but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and _RARE_ her novel
he _RARE_ to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : Have you any objection to the following plan
evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles
shall be free and unknown ; ; we can return the following morning She concluded by asking for a brief interview -- `` to settle with you where '' -- and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild _RARE_ of your _RARE_ ''
his reply with trembling fingers he agreed
would see her that evening
last
meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' -- he would attend to that
one of the new _RARE_ in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left
him _RARE_ charming _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' , which was the _RARE_ of the moment
never _RARE_ better
voice is _RARE_ '' , he approved with a warm smile
will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a _RARE_
been _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , a proud _RARE_ , a silly _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ -- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my _RARE_ ''
they went , he _RARE_ of all places an _RARE_ near _RARE_ _RARE_ , scene a generation ago of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Club
Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the _RARE_ _RARE_ , which he had had at _RARE_ from old _RARE_ _RARE_ , one of the leaders of the so-called `` Order ''
the _RARE_ _RARE_ at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for _RARE_
danced in the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a _RARE_ filled with _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ up pictures of the _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_
all that belonged to the age of `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the Order
_RARE_ of a _RARE_ _RARE_ seemed _RARE_ by comparison
close by the turn to _RARE_
half mile away _RARE_ and Mary were doubtless sitting on their _RARE_ _RARE_ , the air about them _RARE_ with stock , and listening to the _RARE_ who had _RARE_ in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden
peaceful -- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure
the _RARE_ Byron
women had _RARE_ for the privilege that was hers
she to behave , Claire wondered
_RARE_ , to be _RARE_ shy was _RARE_ absurd
the _RARE_ as clearly as was Venus in _RARE_ poem
her _RARE_ did not suffer from _RARE_ , _RARE_ might well be an equal _RARE_
she would not pretend _RARE_ , but neither must she be _RARE_ bold
that was the thing
bedroom she would insist on darkness
club foot he might well be grateful
_RARE_ , which was situated close to a broad _RARE_ , Byron was greeted by the landlord with _RARE_ _RARE_ and addressed as `` _RARE_ ''
was evidently a familiar _RARE_ and Claire wondered what other _RARE_ loves had been _RARE_ in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown
in the sitting room was lighted
about the bedroom ''

to me last time I was here the _RARE_ _RARE_ out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell ''
found some _RARE_ had built a nest in the chimney , _RARE_ , but I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again ''
not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again
suddenly small and cheap , _RARE_ of a trivial _RARE_ in the _RARE_ history of _RARE_ Juan
supper was ordered and a bottle of _RARE_
ship had _RARE_ him to _RARE_ , French _RARE_ had started to cross the _RARE_ , the first shipments in a dozen _RARE_ years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural _RARE_ where the sweet _RARE_ of the Spanish _RARE_ still ruled
waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron _RARE_ as much for his own entertainment as hers
is _RARE_ '' , he said
great Greek _RARE_ are concerned with man against _RARE_ , not man against man for the _RARE_ of a woman's body
see yourself as a _RARE_ or _RARE_ this little adventure is an event of major importance ''
_RARE_ seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she _RARE_
and Venus , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , Jupiter and _RARE_ , Byron and the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ nest

_RARE_ her symbol ''

you know something of the _RARE_ , do you ''
me about _RARE_ , how she behaved , what she did to please you ''
tell you nothing
ask you who _RARE_ you're being _RARE_ to , husband or _RARE_
I don't care ''
moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who _RARE_ away from _RARE_ , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind
well '' , she said , `` I'll not _RARE_ you
the others so long as I have my place in history ''
striking the right note
ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , _RARE_ could hardly seem _RARE_
beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ -- if ever the world was any man's _RARE_ it was his
supper over , Claire went to him and , _RARE_ an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee
her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his
, moist and _RARE_ , spoke his name
''
went to her shoulder and pushed aside the _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ gown ; ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with _RARE_ fingers , _RARE_ it
beneath was _RARE_ and , _RARE_ his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to _RARE_ it , _RARE_ as if she were a child
_RARE_ by his kiss , his _RARE_ hand , her desire was _RARE_
up and went swiftly to the bedroom
poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame _RARE_ the rich color
slowly with due appreciation
an excellent _RARE_
and went to the bedroom
the doorway he said : `` The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most _RARE_ _RARE_ in all nature ''
returned to _RARE_ she _RARE_ to tell them she had become _RARE_ _RARE_
coincidence , on the evening of her return _RARE_ chose to read _RARE_ , which was the latest of the _RARE_ _RARE_ successes
_RARE_ the _RARE_ measures , it was as much as Claire could do to _RARE_ herself from bursting out with her dramatic _RARE_
it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said _RARE_ as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order ''
he would only leave the East '' , said Mary
am tired of _RARE_ and _RARE_ ''
hero of his next poem is _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , said Claire , with slightly _RARE_ _RARE_
do you know that ''

was told it on good authority '' , Claire answered _RARE_
_RARE_ tell , I _RARE_ tell '' , she repeated to herself
promised him I wouldn't ''
winter came , and with it Mary's baby -- a boy as she had wished
he was called , in honor of the man who was at once _RARE_ _RARE_ and his most bitter _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ wrote to the father who had publicly _RARE_ his daughter : `` _RARE_ and Mrs. _RARE_ will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable _RARE_ , and that her child is well ''
same time another child -- this one of _RARE_ brain -- was given to the world : _RARE_ , a poem of _RARE_ beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine _RARE_ _RARE_
published only to be _RARE_ attacked , _RARE_ ignored
a copy to _RARE_ , a former friend , and another to _RARE_

_RARE_ sustained him in his disappointment

attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral _RARE_
_RARE_ of his easy success as compared with _RARE_ failure
month that _RARE_ was published , _RARE_ sold twenty thousand copies of The _RARE_ Of _RARE_ , a _RARE_ bit of _RARE_ that even _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ at
poet was at _RARE_ mark
writing was in keeping with his mood of savage _RARE_
sides doors were being slammed in his face
_RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ as they were , had only served to increase his _RARE_
under the impact of his wife's _RARE_ , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to _RARE_ , however brilliant , however _RARE_ the _RARE_ might be
_RARE_ and openly _RARE_ his _RARE_ to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if _RARE_ in would involve them in a common ruin
moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity
_RARE_ successfully started in the last days of autumn was now _RARE_
since the separation from his wife had been living in a _RARE_ house in _RARE_ _RARE_
to bring Claire to it even as an occasional _RARE_ , claiming that his every move was watched by _RARE_ of the _RARE_
the pass to the colonel
thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the _RARE_ belt
_RARE_ , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines
remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task


me the copies of everything B and C companies have _RARE_ in the last six months
last six months , sir
heard me
lot of waste going on here
to stop
to take a look
no damned holiday , _RARE_

, sir
the tent
could see the bright _RARE_ lighting the _RARE_
back
crouched _RARE_ on one of the _RARE_ chairs , _RARE_ tearing at his _RARE_
was a _RARE_ structure of heavy _RARE_ covered with earth
some fifty _RARE_ from the edge of the bank
outside , it seemed no more than a low _RARE_ , a lump on the dark earth
ladder ran down to a wooden floor
_RARE_ observers to watch across the river
smelled strongly of rank , _RARE_ earth , _RARE_ wood and _RARE_
floor was _RARE_ beneath _RARE_ boots
the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle
no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window _RARE_ and back , _RARE_ slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams
corner was the soldier with the white flag
stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth
looked at him
had come _RARE_ aboard the _RARE_ _RARE_ at the last instant , _RARE_ the flag of _RARE_
_RARE_ him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed
with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank
in the boats had started yelling _RARE_ at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy
boat had touched , the _RARE_ ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers
presented his _RARE_ and been led to the _RARE_
had told him that both lists must be checked
given his name and asked for a _RARE_ pass
, surprised , said he would have to see
nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later
peered through the darkness at the _RARE_
he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them
no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and _RARE_ that other men felt
hoped to be alone in the _RARE_ , but the soldier had followed him
carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence
would be better to speak to him , since silence could not _RARE_ his form
briefly at him , seeing only a body _RARE_ erect behind the _RARE_ _RARE_
won't be too long
pass is approved , I may be a half hour
answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving
away and did not see the man's knees _RARE_ and his body _RARE_
, sir
acknowledged the man
easier to think now , Watson decided
figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts
slowly , _RARE_ , staring at the damp , _RARE_ floor
to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some _RARE_ _RARE_ of the dead boy
groped _RARE_
of success steadily _RARE_ his interest
_RARE_ , leaned against the _RARE_ , _RARE_ wall and let his mind drift
of _RARE_ , an _RARE_ of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , _RARE_ through him
the name of God was he doing , crouched in a _RARE_ pit on the wrong bank of the river
he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of _RARE_ soldiers or to _RARE_ in a _RARE_ hole
annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion
conscious of a growing sense of _RARE_
written it all out , hadn't he
report official enough
he hope to accomplish here
ordered him not to leave the far bank
a guilty urge , he had _RARE_ the order of a man he respected

John something he would find out for himself
in the corner _RARE_ loudly , a deep , liquid _RARE_
and then laughed aloud

voice was muffled again , _RARE_ with _RARE_
the staff , and his dark eyes _RARE_ _RARE_
me , sir
get out of here
up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river _RARE_
left , the two _RARE_ _RARE_ their sharp _RARE_ into the soft bank
boat swung slowly to the pull of the current
held the end of a _RARE_ rope
guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready
at them curiously
_RARE_ men , well fed and _RARE_ , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots
_RARE_ a long column of weak , _RARE_ men
gray figures raised a _RARE_ , _RARE_ cry like the call of a bird _RARE_
toward the _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_
were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise
down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats
soldiers _RARE_ arms and settled into healthy , _RARE_ _RARE_ to watch the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_
men tried to rise and fell again
moved to them
two of them _RARE_ into the _RARE_ water and listened to their voices beg _RARE_
confused , _RARE_ and _RARE_ shift of bodies and _RARE_ arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff
crawling man forced himself erect
like a _RARE_ , his arms milling in slow circles
forward _RARE_ , leaning too far back , his head tilted _RARE_
were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a _RARE_ _RARE_
to be peering _RARE_ down his nose at the crowded and _RARE_ vessel that would carry him to freedom
into the water and fell heavily over the side of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , his weight nearly _RARE_ the craft
for the fourth man
reached the three _RARE_ guards ; ; he crept in an _RARE_ manner , _RARE_ the ground before him
did not look at him
on the earth halted , seemingly _RARE_
back on his thin _RARE_ like a weary _RARE_
began to crawl again
the _RARE_ figure
a _RARE_ interest
man make it or not
there was a clock for him to crawl against
failed to reach the _RARE_ in five minutes , say , then the _RARE_ would pull away and leave him _RARE_ in the mud
minutes to make it _RARE_
guards did not move , but stood _RARE_ , _RARE_ from the _RARE_ man
halted , and Watson _RARE_
began to creep in the wrong direction , _RARE_ by a slight rise in the ground
slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the _RARE_
for him , his boots _RARE_ the soft earth
came to life with _RARE_ _RARE_
and flung their rifles up
wildly
dropped to his knee for better aim
me help him , for the love of God
lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces
to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily
down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm
_RARE_ , a flat strip of muscle _RARE_ on the bone
_RARE_ and lifted the man to his feet
into a _RARE_ face
balls the color of _RARE_ rolled between _RARE_ _RARE_
of fingers , the tips _RARE_ with dark earth , patted at _RARE_ throat
voice was a sweet , patient whisper
said that he'd take my arm and get me right there
ain't Henry

don't matter
far
could it be , Watson thought _RARE_ , how far can a blind man crawl
length or all the rest of his _RARE_ life
far
talk deep
us _RARE_
the voice , _RARE_ in camp


, now
walk
, course I can
walk real good
down the bank
leaned his frail body against _RARE_ shoulder
no heavier than a child
for breath
_RARE_ _RARE_ , his _RARE_ breath beating softly against _RARE_ neck
whisper came after great effort
, Christ
you was Henry
to take me

there
the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff
swayed on a _RARE_ , turning his ruined eyes from side to side
away , _RARE_ for the first time in many months
the patient voice calling

you , Henry
him lie down
a deep breath
not meant to shout
with his back to the skiff
_RARE_ and scratched , begging to be taken away
_RARE_ to the dark night _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_
you
you do to them
at him _RARE_
angry , _RARE_
not felt that during the afternoon
nor later
emotions had been _RARE_ , _RARE_
, on a night like this , it was only the _RARE_ emotions that _RARE_ , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others

it
sure of it
of man allowed this sort of thing to happen
fool he had been to think of his brother
was dead
it matter
had been crossed off a list
cool body lay in the ground
had any meaning
he thought of , to go to John , _RARE_ and beg understanding
with a canvas chair as a _RARE_ , _RARE_ at his heart until a rough and stupid hand _RARE_ him rise and go
_RARE_ every day , tumbled into _RARE_ like so many torn _RARE_ flung down a _RARE_ _RARE_
him think John had a right to witness his brother's _RARE_
had John to any special consideration
better , more _RARE_
with John
_RARE_ with impatience to see Charles , _RARE_ open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in _RARE_ beautiful , _RARE_ hand
_RARE_
that brave boys didn't cry
on the ground
grimly satisfied
_RARE_ thought himself _RARE_ to ease his brother's pain
knew perfectly that he had but _RARE_ to increase his own suffering
not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by _RARE_ , `` O _RARE_ , O _RARE_ , O _RARE_ and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter _RARE_ with four _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , and three composition _RARE_ with long _RARE_ and red _RARE_ ''
say , I wouldn't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done
shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the _RARE_ and _RARE_ trees that grow on the ridge
see it from this window where I write
built by the _RARE_ , and stands on the _RARE_ of ground that _RARE_ our property
under a _RARE_ of thin , new grass , like some _RARE_ fact of _RARE_ , and I think Mrs. Pastern set out the _RARE_ to _RARE_ its meaning
have been like her
a pale woman
her _RARE_ , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an _RARE_ of _RARE_
a cup of tea and she would say , `` Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the _RARE_ Army last year ''
the new swimming pool and she would say , _RARE_ her ankle , `` I suppose this must be where you _RARE_ your gigantic _RARE_ ''
a chair and she would say , `` Why , it's a nice _RARE_ of those _RARE_ Anne chairs I inherited from _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children _RARE_ , and her marriage _RARE_ _RARE_
ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of _RARE_
wore _RARE_ , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr. Pastern was dead , but Mr. Pastern was far from dead

began on an autumn afternoon -- and who , after all these centuries , can describe the _RARE_ of an autumn day
pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it
and searching _RARE_ of sun on the _RARE_ was like a _RARE_ of the year's lights
burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its _RARE_ _RARE_ , of _RARE_
blue air was stretched over the _RARE_ like the skin of a _RARE_
house one late afternoon , Mrs. Pastern stopped to _RARE_ the October light
the day to _RARE_ for infectious _RARE_
had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of _RARE_
her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks
stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below
she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw _RARE_ _RARE_
worked for the brain
_RARE_ did mental health
worked for the blind
was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat
was _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ was _RARE_ March of _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ was _RARE_ , and Mrs. _RARE_ did the _RARE_
led the _RARE_ _RARE_ , Mrs. _RARE_ was _RARE_ , and way in the distance could be seen the _RARE_ roof of _RARE_ _RARE_ house , a roof that _RARE_ _RARE_

had done it before her , and even her old _RARE_ , who had collected money for _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her
none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling _RARE_
there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of _RARE_
were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her _RARE_ with big checks
at the _RARE_ after dusk , and had a _RARE_
too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband
got a hundred and sixty dollars for the _RARE_ fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in
did everybody on my list but the _RARE_ and the _RARE_
to get my _RARE_ in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner ''
I don't know the _RARE_ '' , Charlie Pastern said
does , but they gave me ten last year ''
tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork _RARE_ in the _RARE_ only seemed like an extension of a _RARE_ day
happy enough to take the _RARE_ and race up the hill to the _RARE_ , thinking that they might give him a drink
_RARE_ were away ; ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door
at the _RARE_ driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them
encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the _RARE_
a glass _RARE_ in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a _RARE_ woman with red hair was arranging flowers
_RARE_ '' , he shouted heartily
a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door
, please come in '' , she said
voice was nearly a whisper
not a girl , he could see
was _RARE_ , and her _RARE_ was _RARE_ , and she must have been _RARE_ forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who _RARE_ to the manners and _RARE_ of a pretty child of eight
wife just called '' , she said , _RARE_ one word from another , exactly like a child
I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my _RARE_
step into the living room , where it's _RARE_ ''
had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these _RARE_ was _RARE_
Mr. Flannagan , he wondered
on a late train

end of the room there was a desk _RARE_ with papers , and she began to _RARE_ these , making _RARE_ and and _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_

Flannagan is away '' , she said

Flannagan has been away for six weeks
I'll have a drink , then , if you'll have one with me ''
you will promise to make it weak ''

way to find things is to relax ''

_RARE_ plastic tongue _RARE_
all over the world
like to travel
her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home
her husband had _RARE_ lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr. Flannagan thought the country would be _RARE_ in case of war
rather live in danger than die of _RARE_ and boredom
no children ; ; she had made no friends
seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous _RARE_ , _RARE_ his knee
seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the _RARE_
thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her _RARE_
, he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no _RARE_ functions
merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the _RARE_
its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for _RARE_
she made about the _RARE_ of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her _RARE_ there
never done this before '' , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave
shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely
doubt her _RARE_ , although he had heard the words a hundred times
never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders
never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor
never done this before '' , they always said , _RARE_ another whiskey
never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their _RARE_
at sea , on railroad _RARE_ , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , `` I've never done this before ''

was tied up in a _RARE_ hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for _RARE_ , and luck had been running against him
_RARE_ him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window
_RARE_ he could see the trees stripped of their leaves
summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his _RARE_ tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the _RARE_ near _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth
home from school would _RARE_ through what seemed to be his _RARE_
getting back into bed , he thought _RARE_ of Mrs. Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do
, he thought , so few true means of _RARE_ in this life that why should he _RARE_ the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude
not as though she noted clearly that her _RARE_ had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey _RARE_ to witness their Uncle _RARE_ being lowered into the rocky soil ; ; that aside from due _RARE_ of certain major events in their lives ( two marriages , two _RARE_ , one divorce ) , Christmas and _RARE_ cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the _RARE_ years

and walked stiffly into the parlor to the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray

trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , _RARE_ , as _RARE_ as they would dropping from her own lips
stiffly _RARE_ look of them , she saw grimly , _RARE_ the _RARE_ of age which , _RARE_ the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged _RARE_

: `` I am afraid there is not much to _RARE_ small children here

: `` Please give my _RARE_ to Myra ''
the letters quickly , _RARE_ them , and placed them on the hall table for _RARE_ to mail in town
went back to the _RARE_ chair and _RARE_ adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water
_RARE_ will be coming down '' , she said that evening as _RARE_ brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast _RARE_ tray
at the girl _RARE_ from eyes which had _RARE_ with the years ; ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled _RARE_ to look at her in an _RARE_ way , they had faded to a _RARE_ of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them

, and the teeth _RARE_ in her _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ face

turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen
lifted her head and followed the _RARE_ figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the _RARE_ rise and fall of the rounded hips
moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; ; then she _RARE_ and groped for her fork
greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected _RARE_ , _RARE_ tender green _RARE_ on the silver fork , than the _RARE_ away of a family
expansion , _RARE_ -- these are the laws of living things , with the _RARE_ for not _RARE_ them the ultimate in _RARE_ : _RARE_
fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward _RARE_ ) , _RARE_ , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted
the young garden _RARE_ were _RARE_ in her mouth
the last living of the older generation
once been a widespread family -- at one time , she knew , there were enough _RARE_ to _RARE_ an entire county -- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark
her eyes up to the blue of the window , her _RARE_ gently _RARE_ the bitter _RARE_
lay in the _RARE_ , she asked the _RARE_ light out there , with one married to a _RARE_ woman and the other _RARE_ , having _RARE_ two girl children , with none to bear on the _RARE_ name

to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became _RARE_ at the _RARE_ empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she _RARE_ with shadows
too , she talked low , _RARE_ her head at one or another of the places , most often at _RARE_ _RARE_ which faced her across the long table
might have been the absent _RARE_ she addressed , _RARE_ playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years
again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate _RARE_
, her first , she barely remembered

boy the boy had been alive yesterday
movement in his growing was recorded on the _RARE_ film inside her
on his _RARE_ sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the _RARE_ photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat _RARE_ _RARE_ in the bottom drawer of the _RARE_
cruel _RARE_ of her memory the boy remained _RARE_ , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still _RARE_ to her
one with the _RARE_ rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea
drove down together in _RARE_ small red sports car , Mark at the wheel
spoke
and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled _RARE_ up to where the silent white houses and long _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ into the _RARE_ fields
the land with a _RARE_ eyes , all the old _RARE_ gone
presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , _RARE_ , complete in itself

the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his _RARE_ _RARE_ out in one _RARE_ moment of _RARE_
Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the _RARE_ Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer
turned his head to look at his brother
the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a _RARE_ way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come
hair was already beginning to thin and _RARE_ at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away
looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably _RARE_
traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea
didn't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , _RARE_ the car into the next _RARE_
probably getting old -- _RARE_ , I mean -- and we figured _RARE_ , better not
met , you know
wouldn't _RARE_ without an express _RARE_
kind of bad about it ''
Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this _RARE_ of _RARE_ to guilt

barely possible that his brother was right

took on a special strength now that they'd left the _RARE_ warmth of the _RARE_ behind
the smell of the coast , like a _RARE_ memory , composed of equal parts salt water , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and northern air
from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an _RARE_ boy's eye again the great _RARE_ house which , built on one of the many acres of _RARE_ land _RARE_ the west _RARE_ , had been _RARE_ _RARE_ to his _RARE_ as the last century ended
must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same _RARE_ in dirty white _RARE_ , _RARE_ out on top of the _RARE_ and coming upon the sudden _RARE_ water at the same instant

the day Uncle _RARE_ had , in an unexpected _RARE_ gesture , handed over the pretty _RARE_ to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished

climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly _RARE_ solid _RARE_ , became two parallel luminous tubes which _RARE_ out into a faint mist of light and ended

I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldn't watch , dying just to _RARE_ Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a _RARE_ hall , Pa _RARE_ under the covers at the end like _RARE_ covered with snow , snoring and _RARE_
not care about the Pedersen kid
care about getting _RARE_ so he could give up some of his whisky to a _RARE_ of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the _RARE_
make him mad enough if he was sober
hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen
all _RARE_ up like I thought he'd be
at his shoulder , calling his name
his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when I shoved him
slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , _RARE_ like a _RARE_ gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall -- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought , Well you don't look much like a _RARE_ _RARE_ now
be sure he was still asleep
a _RARE_ _RARE_

like a mean horse to come at from the rear

he was when Hans found him ''

ain't _RARE_ nothing in the _RARE_ ''
don't understand , Pa
kid
'' -- `` I goddamn well understand ''
his head up , _RARE_ , his teeth _RARE_ at the place where he'd grown a _RARE_ once
goddamn well understand
I don't want to see Pedersen

I
he come for , _RARE_
, get
come back
something
fool
and Hans


back


shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the _RARE_
long black hairs on his wrist
around the _RARE_ of his _RARE_
Hans made me come
said '' -- `` A fat hell on Big Hans
even bigger fool than you are
_RARE_
him , _RARE_ , and I'll teach you

me to drop my pot ''
about to get up so I got out , _RARE_ the door
beginning to see he was too mad to sleep
threw things
went after Hans and dumped his pot over the _RARE_
_RARE_ in that pot
an _RARE_
even bother to wipe himself off and he _RARE_ part of _RARE_ door down before he stopped
not have gone that far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house
put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it
felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their _RARE_ like a laugh or a _RARE_ , as eager as an animal to be out
Pa _RARE_ all the way downstairs
laid _RARE_ towels over the kid's chest and stomach
rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet
the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning _RARE_ , _RARE_ to the kid's back and behind
he going to wake up ''
about your _RARE_ ''
was awake when I left ''
he say
get the whisky ''
said a fat hell on Big Hans ''
be smart
ask him about the whisky ''
''
''
said a fat hell on Big Hans ''
be smart
going to do ''
back to sleep most likely ''
best get that whisky ''
go
_RARE_
to hell of axes ''
to me , _RARE_ , I've had enough to your _RARE_
_RARE_ bad
don't get some whisky down him he might die
the kid to die

get your _RARE_ and get that whisky ''
don't care about the kid ''
''
he don't
care at all , and I don't care to get my head _RARE_ neither
care , and I don't care to have his _RARE_ flung on me
care about anybody
_RARE_ about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face
-- that's what he wants
care about nothing else at all

kid neither

kid neither ''
get the spirits '' , Ma said
Big Hans up tight
ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down
went near the old man when he was sleeping it off
more
years
thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot _RARE_ , and maybe she saw him _RARE_ it again , the dirty _RARE_ _RARE_ out as it flew
have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the _RARE_ while he was still _RARE_ with _RARE_ yellow sick _RARE_
you won't '' , Big Hans said
, Hans , if they're needed '' , Ma said
his head but neither of us tried to stop her
had , then one of us would have had to go instead
the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed
get more snow '' , I said
the _RARE_ and _RARE_ and went out on the porch
know where Ma went
she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had
surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it _RARE_ by the throat
he was being _RARE_ and careful , _RARE_ about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm
awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn't thinking about that at all , not anything like that
no way of getting even
like getting _RARE_ at the fair
always trying so you got to expect it
had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable ; ; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back
the foil off finally and _RARE_ the cap
put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she'd done
found one of _RARE_ hiding places
one and she hadn't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the _RARE_ and found the first one
a _RARE_ for hiding
we were looking and he enjoyed it
Ma
it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how long ago _RARE_ been or how many other ones she'd found , saying nothing
sure to find out
didn't seem to because he _RARE_ them so well he couldn't find them himself or because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't _RARE_ one after all or had drunk it up
find out about this one because we were using it
could see what was going on
found out Ma found it -- _RARE_ be bad
pride in his hiding
all the pride he had
_RARE_ Hans and me took doing
didn't figure Ma for much
figure her at all , and if he found out a woman _RARE_ be bad
some in a _RARE_
going to put more towels on him ''
''
not
he needs , something warm to his skin , don't he ''
where he's _RARE_ good
for _RARE_
I only put towels on his chest and belly
to _RARE_ slow
to know that ''
the towels had run
her _RARE_ in the kid's clothes
are we going to do with these ''
began _RARE_ whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was _RARE_ from his chin
, help me _RARE_ him up
hold his mouth open ''
want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to
on , _RARE_ ''
right ''
, don't _RARE_ lift ''
, I'm _RARE_ ''
him by the shoulders
flopped back
fell open
on his neck was tight
cold all right
his head up
''
mouth is open ''
_RARE_ shut
''
_RARE_ anyway ''
his head up ''
can't ''
hold him like that
arms around him ''
Jesus ''
cold all right
my arm carefully around him
his fingers in the kid's mouth
he'll _RARE_ for sure ''
up
him like I told you ''
cold all right , and wet
my arm behind his back
in his _RARE_ at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be _RARE_ yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had _RARE_ off _RARE_
never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ; it was always the same _RARE_ success now
no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in _RARE_ , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same _RARE_ technique , they were such _RARE_ and sometimes even _RARE_ buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic _RARE_ about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer _RARE_ as to its other values
was _RARE_ famous , a _RARE_ of a genuine _RARE_ in foreign eyes , an original _RARE_ whose _RARE_ _RARE_ with steel and concrete was made even more _RARE_ sincere by his personality
lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ; he rose at _RARE_ six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn _RARE_ and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last _RARE_ Herald _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , then put on his _RARE_ _RARE_ shoes and walked under a _RARE_ _RARE_ to his workshop
an _RARE_ long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every _RARE_ during his six years as an oil _RARE_
of his other _RARE_ was piled everywhere ; ; a pile of wire _RARE_ for mice from his time as a _RARE_ and a _RARE_ lying on its side on the window _RARE_ , vertical steel columns _RARE_ for support to the open ceiling beams with _RARE_ steel _RARE_ _RARE_ out into the air , _RARE_ _RARE_ on the floor from the time he was _RARE_ his _RARE_ _RARE_ whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire _RARE_ on each floor
, desk , _RARE_ board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the _RARE_
his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ from his painting days , and _RARE_ a _RARE_ of _RARE_ books that looked as though their _RARE_ had been _RARE_ by a _RARE_
he had once used as the basis of the design for the _RARE_ _RARE_ Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of _RARE_ _RARE_ which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house
standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , _RARE_ with the surprised stare of one who was watching another _RARE_ hand
would _RARE_ softly to some _RARE_ _RARE_ beside him , sometimes he would look stern and _RARE_ as his pencil did what he _RARE_
seemed -- if one could have _RARE_ in at him through one of his windows -- as though this _RARE_ man with the muscular arms and _RARE_ neck was merely the _RARE_ trying his hand at the _RARE_ work
of _RARE_ carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often _RARE_ it for boredom in him or a surrender to _RARE_ routine
was not _RARE_ at all ; ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it
, after all , fortunate _RARE_ who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and _RARE_ was , as things go , a fortunate man
his home the day after New _RARE_ wearing a _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and without a hat
wear this same _RARE_ in Florida , despite his wife _RARE_ _RARE_ over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him
was too busy to hear what she was saying
_RARE_ when she was in an impatient humor
was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his _RARE_ _RARE_ for the _RARE_ key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous _RARE_ _RARE_ over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window
key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the _RARE_ fog , and said , `` _RARE_ the refrigerator ''
the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the _RARE_ expression he had ever seen
on laughing until she started laughing with him
a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ; an _RARE_ laugh which always carried everything before it
settle himself into his seat to laugh
laughed it was all he was doing
was made to fall in love with him again there in the _RARE_ dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by
_RARE_ at this time , a _RARE_ woman of _RARE_ with an _RARE_ , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some _RARE_ that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer
were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders
an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the _RARE_ look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an _RARE_ line long since _RARE_ from _RARE_ and which , besides , has kept its estate intact
personally _RARE_ , and when she had _RARE_ would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , _RARE_ from her waist , and when she _RARE_ she would eat dinner with dirt on her _RARE_
when she seemed to have _RARE_ into some _RARE_ of _RARE_ she would _RARE_ and come down _RARE_ , brushed , and taking _RARE_ of air , and even with her broken _RARE_ her hands would come to rest on a table or a _RARE_ with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how _RARE_ proud she was and _RARE_ on certain questions of personal value
spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp
drive carefully , for God's sake ''
, trying to attain a half _RARE_ _RARE_ at his departure
did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying `` _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ of a tree as he passed it , the same _RARE_ which had _RARE_ the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed
clutching her _RARE_ around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road
when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window
begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell
at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his _RARE_ hair was _RARE_ a little and his breath came hard through his _RARE_ lungs , the look of the _RARE_ youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the _RARE_ _RARE_ on a Thursday once
kept herself _RARE_ ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` _RARE_ ''
and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the _RARE_ with which it pressed the _RARE_ , just as his hand did when he worked
back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building
a death in all _RARE_ , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind
great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the _RARE_ part of life
could let out the three _RARE_ without fear they would be stepped on or that _RARE_ would let them out one of the doors ; ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ ; ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , _RARE_ nothing on her mind but letting her soul _RARE_ itself above all _RARE_ and desire
this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be
asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house _RARE_ as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their _RARE_ and the occasional _RARE_ of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of her arm
minutes she would _RARE_ for a moment to review things : _RARE_ , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and _RARE_ was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers
fell asleep again as _RARE_ as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes
up , _RARE_ her hair down , _RARE_ her clothes , feeling a _RARE_ for the _RARE_ darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of _RARE_ coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she _RARE_ a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head _RARE_ , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for _RARE_ to come with her guests
into the living room and turned on three _RARE_ , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the _RARE_ on the barn , _RARE_ the driveway
she was feeling afraid and _RARE_ laughed at herself
both so young , after all , so _RARE_ for any final _RARE_
it have been thirty years already , she wondered
, nineteen plus thirty was _RARE_ , and she was _RARE_ and she had been married at nineteen
still over the leg of _RARE_ , rubbing _RARE_ into it , quite suddenly conscious of a _RARE_ in her stomach and a feeling of _RARE_ , a sensation of violence that started her shivering
all said , `` No , your time will come
a bride while you can ''
no room for company in the tiny _RARE_ House ( where the _RARE_ boys always took their _RARE_ , till they could get a house and a farm of their own )
the Big House filled up and ran over , the _RARE_ found beds for everyone in their own homes
was still not anything that Linda Kay could do
Kay gave up asking , and accepted her _RARE_
so , she was really grateful ; ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby _RARE_ wife
made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it _RARE_ and neat , _RARE_ as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe
done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this
, she would have said , in _RARE_ , or in cars on the highway at night
was gone all day now , not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper
first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal
was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it _RARE_ , and she did not know where he went
she complained , or had any cause to
five of the cousins from East _RARE_ were about his age , so naturally they ran around together
no reason for her to ask what they did
new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny _RARE_ did not die
still on the bed , her head hardly _RARE_ the _RARE_ ; ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk or _RARE_
expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two
had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home , for she might die any time ; ; but they might as well _RARE_ their _RARE_ , for she might _RARE_ on
pattern was established
Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and _RARE_ her _RARE_ _RARE_ , she would go to the Big House
not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be
and the boys would come by , say `` How's Granny ''
on the porch a while
men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town
and children stayed at the _RARE_
, keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room , sounded like chickens shut up in a _RARE_ for the night
had to play away from the house ( in the barn _RARE_ or the _RARE_ behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper _RARE_
on , all day , someone would be _RARE_ at the _RARE_ gray dust that settled over everything
_RARE_ had been moved to _RARE_ room , and her door was kept shut ; ; so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was _RARE_ or _RARE_ that way
_RARE_ their _RARE_ , and the heat _RARE_ them , so that the women were always making ice water
cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy _RARE_ blocks of ice in town , as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the _RARE_ who ate and drank there
, as the women sat _RARE_ softly , a new _RARE_ of people pulled up at the gate
a _RARE_ , black _RARE_ with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and _RARE_
an old fat couple ( as Linda Kay described them to herself ) , a thick _RARE_ man , and a girl about ten or twelve
much _RARE_ , much _RARE_
Ada
''
_RARE_ ''
Howard ''
how is she ''
the same , John , about the same ''
women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations
were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to _RARE_ , `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home
on as soon as we could ''
the suggestion of ice water , and -- in spite of the protest `` We're not really _RARE_ '' -- Linda Kay , to escape the _RARE_ air and the _RARE_ soft voices , hurried to the kitchen
a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray
to the living room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and _RARE_ _RARE_ , a bit sophisticated in her yellow _RARE_ , with a _RARE_ _RARE_ walk that she had learned as a _RARE_ with the school band
she was ashamed of herself for feeling _RARE_ , at such a time , in such a place , and she tossed back her long yellow hair , smiling _RARE_ as she entered the room
the thick _RARE_ man ) was looking at her
the look and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed
who is this ''
, when she passed him a glass
that's Linda Kay '' , Mama _RARE_ said _RARE_
married our baby boy , Bobby Joe , this summer ''
see '' , Cousin Ada said
a right smart younger than the rest ''
yes '' , Mama laughed
ten years younger than _RARE_
expect him to come along ; ; thought for the _RARE_ he was a tumor ''
was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; ; then , hearing the muffled _RARE_ of _RARE_ laughter , blushed _RARE_
is Howard , anyway ''
Bobby Joe that night
makes me uncomfortable ''
he's a second cousin or something
in the oil business out at _RARE_ and _RARE_ into some money ''
old is he ''
, I don't know
I guess
married and got this _RARE_ kid
_RARE_ you , don't pay him any mind
a big _RARE_ ''
was thinking about something else
, did you know they're fixing to have a _RARE_ antelope season on the _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
talking about antelope again when they woke up
, I never had a chance to kill an antelope
was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the _RARE_ ''
he ever visit here when he was a kid ''
asked
''
''
, I don't know
was a kid I wasn't around ''
took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` _RARE_ now '' was gone for the day
Howard and his daughter _RARE_ drove up in the _RARE_
going after ice '' , Howard said , `` and thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company ''
really no reason to refuse , and Linda Kay had never _RARE_ in a _RARE_
the _RARE_ road to town , Howard talked
said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life
such a _RARE_ _RARE_ , having been a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and secretary of _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe , who was a _RARE_ player , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and president of _RARE_ _RARE_
easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted
would be a senior this year , and he planned to _RARE_
was no need for Linda Kay to go on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and ( _RARE_ ) raise his children

lucky kids '' , he said
give anything if I could have found a girl like you ''
told Linda Kay about himself
he couldn't say much , really , because of _RARE_ , but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got
her feel different about Howard
going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins home for supper , and all they did was talk about antelope
was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home
a whole antelope ''

, I couldn't even cook a piece of antelope _RARE_ ; ; I never even saw any ''
, you could
to _RARE_ the whole thing , and have it for the boys ''
told him he couldn't do anything like that with his Grandma dying , and he said well they had to eat , didn't they , they weren't all dying
felt like going off to the bedroom to cry ; ; but they were going up to the Big House after supper , and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little
they all went to Mama and Papa _RARE_ , and sat on the open front porch , where they could get the breeze
_RARE_ ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day
sat around and drank ice water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time
a while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other way
the older men got to talking about going _RARE_ on a moonlight night
and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been _RARE_ , and Uncle Bill _RARE_ ( from Mama _RARE_ side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then
had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit
not many chairs , so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch , resting their feet on the ground , and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall
who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting
be a _RARE_ sight more comfortable there , Howard '' , _RARE_ said , laughing , and they all laughed
felt that she was not exactly more comfortable
had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand from time to time , but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer
was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; ; but she had never been so aware of _RARE_ flesh before
was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was _RARE_
become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell
sold oil stock to _RARE_ Hope and _RARE_ _RARE_ in person ; ; he had helped fight an _RARE_ fire that raged six days and nights
tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the _RARE_ ''

will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor _RARE_ , _RARE_ Alex's _RARE_
I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help _RARE_ the hen back into the hotel ''
paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel , room number nine , to _RARE_ Alex further into these _RARE_
opened the smallest of his cases , an _RARE_ straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex's inspection
carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a _RARE_ _RARE_ was required to _RARE_ what _RARE_ valuable _RARE_ lay inside ; ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual _RARE_ eggs
little enough time to _RARE_ them , however ; ; in an instant the doctor was _RARE_ across the room with an _RARE_ _RARE_ in his hands , thoroughly _RARE_ and big as a table top
it on Alex's lap
is my hen _RARE_ '' , he informed him in an absorbed way
been going since _RARE_ when I was a junior in college
entry there is the Vermont _RARE_ , the earliest and one of the most successful of my _RARE_ _RARE_ -- great big _RARE_ and hardly any _RARE_ at all
them near a river , though , or they'd _RARE_ like a _RARE_ _RARE_ the day before Thanksgiving ''
was full of most precise information : date of _RARE_ , length of _RARE_ period , number of _RARE_ reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of _RARE_ _RARE_ and so on , all _RARE_ out in a hand that looked more _RARE_ than English , the most _RARE_ and _RARE_ Alex had ever seen
_RARE_ was a series of _RARE_ connected by arrows and _RARE_ which denoted the _RARE_ of the _RARE_
was rapid , for the doctor had to go off to the _RARE_ _RARE_ De _RARE_ to hear more speeches with only time for one _RARE_ of wine to sustain him through them all
the doctor's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its _RARE_ powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a _RARE_ hen
at Alex's door _RARE_ him at six o'clock the following morning
the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in _RARE_
stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the _RARE_ _RARE_ , past the bedroom of the _RARE_ , and so into the street
was not far and , once there , the doctor's sense of _RARE_ left him and he fell into a state of _RARE_ with the birds around him
the _RARE_ and they responded with delighted _RARE_ , he _RARE_ with the _RARE_ and they at once were all attention , he _RARE_ with the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ with a pair of exceedingly _RARE_ _RARE_
progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his _RARE_ when quite abruptly something broke his _RARE_
a fine _RARE_ hen , white , with a _RARE_ eye and a striking _RARE_ of feathers in the under region of the _RARE_
, with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex's attention to those _RARE_ which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the length and quality of neck and saddle _RARE_ , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare _RARE_ in the formation of the ear _RARE_
was ended ; ; he had found his _RARE_
was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , _RARE_ in the doctor's arms
struck _RARE_ as they approached the hotel entrance ; ; and hopes that the _RARE_ and _RARE_ would still be _RARE_ began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast
was wearing a long New England _RARE_ , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well _RARE_ to the _RARE_ of _RARE_
first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ on his left side where the hen was _RARE_
in a line across the entrance hall to the _RARE_ and up , with _RARE_ steps , towards the first landing
then that they heard the _RARE_ of one _RARE_ and , in some _RARE_ glancing up , saw the _RARE_ coming towards them as they gained the landing
, _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , she greeted them pleasantly
that they had been out for a _RARE_ before breakfast while the doctor _RARE_ around behind him , attempting to hide the _RARE_ at his left side behind Alex's arm and back

her that there was no hurry for their _RARE_ , trying at the same time to effect a _RARE_ separation of the persons before and behind him
, he noticed , was attempting a _RARE_ movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the air in the hollow of the _RARE_
in the _RARE_ head , Alex _RARE_ loudly , and the doctor , with a _RARE_ of chicken _RARE_ _RARE_ behind him , took to the stairs in _RARE_ _RARE_
''
surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , _RARE_ from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor's _RARE_ American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work
he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze
entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the _RARE_ _RARE_
no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business
appeared to have no _RARE_ as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them
of her audience was totally engaged , the _RARE_ _RARE_ a _RARE_ fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand
progressed towards a _RARE_ which was obviously still remote ; ; the audience attended
but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an _RARE_ knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature
he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went to the door
it a crack and in doing so made as much _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ noise as possible in order to _RARE_ _RARE_ from the hen who had begun to protest
_RARE_ , the fille de _RARE_ , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears _RARE_ up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the _RARE_ bird
reluctant but Alex succeeded in _RARE_ her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again
was that , young _RARE_ ''
instantly asked
was the fille de _RARE_ , the one you thought couldn't get the eggs out
mighty interested , though
coming back in five minutes to do the room ''
mind was working at a great speed ; ; he rose to put his _RARE_ on and addressed Alex in a _RARE_ voice

in my pocket ''
right

was empty and Alex _RARE_ ; ; they climbed the stairs which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor
was _RARE_ his room ; ; they passed behind him and got to Alex's room _RARE_
sat down rather wearily , _RARE_ the hen and _RARE_ that the city was not the place for a _RARE_ man , but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his _RARE_ once more
door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly _RARE_ fille de _RARE_ to return in ten minutes
evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began Alex's
three minutes and then crept out on _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door
of sheets being _RARE_ and _RARE_ being arranged indicated the fille de _RARE_ presence inside ; ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact
shot down to the _RARE_ and turned the _RARE_ , but to no effect : the _RARE_ was occupied
look of alarm passed over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the _RARE_ emerged from number nine
those expressions of relief which offered to _RARE_ in his face and escape from his throat ; ; _RARE_ they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de _RARE_ , his ears were _RARE_ by new sounds from the interior of the shower room
of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the _RARE_ life of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of _RARE_ _RARE_ , perhaps _RARE_ her nest , but briefly enjoyed
_RARE_ had not left him , however , for all his _RARE_ years , and the _RARE_ were almost immediately lost in the sound of water _RARE_ out from the _RARE_
to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room
the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their _RARE_
he opened the closet and from its _RARE_ constructed a _RARE_ around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside
the hen was _RARE_ and all seemed well
men sat for some time , _RARE_ the pleasure of escape from _RARE_ and the relief such escape brings , before they got up and left the hotel , the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office
to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an _RARE_ mood
time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most _RARE_ after the occurrences of the morning
have short _RARE_ '' , the doctor remarked , `` that's why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex
'' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those _RARE_ over at the conference house do
a big _RARE_ from _RARE_ at the _RARE_ here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only _RARE_ of their species outside Africa
she's willing , but the male just _RARE_ around all day like the _RARE_ boy who took _RARE_ May behind the barn and then didn't know what to do , and the people at the _RARE_ haven't got any _RARE_ _RARE_ to show for their trouble
with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that _RARE_ look
times it wasn't right to make a person happy , like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we don't keep _RARE_ `` butter for a _RARE_ butter sandwich
this house '' , he always told her
, Winston '' , she'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the _RARE_ ''
knew how important it was for her to keep her figure
kitchen , _RARE_ , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper
hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool
'' , Winston said gently , `` what's these dishes doing not washed ''
plates which had held Mr. Jack's four _RARE_ eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink
me alone '' , _RARE_ said
you see I'm busy ''
at him _RARE_ over the corner of the paper
is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made

had _RARE_ on her leg ; ; _RARE_ , he touched her knee
I catch you one more time down here without _RARE_ '' -- She _RARE_ her leg away

an _RARE_ _RARE_ manners
Miss _RARE_ thin pink dishes in the sink
spread out the last list on the counter
Be _RARE_ Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss Ada ; ; fine hand
out a pencil , admired the point , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ dropped the paper and stood up

her _RARE_ to _RARE_ her apron
''
he _RARE_ the bow
come your _RARE_ is always _RARE_ ''
and put her arms around his neck
don't want to leave here , Winston ''
listen to that ''
back , embarrassed and pleased
thought you was sick to death of this big house
wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms ''
least there is room here '' , she said
room is there going to be in an apartment for any child ''
told you what Miss _RARE_ doctor said ''
don't mean Miss Ada
think I care about that
our children ''
as though they already existed
of the hundred things he had on his mind , Winston went and put his arm around her waist
got plenty of time to think about that
time in the world

years ''

a long time , waiting ''
many times have I told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times ''
_RARE_ to the sink , where she began _RARE_ to wash her hands
times was the truth of it , Winston thought
believed his reason himself any more
had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children
you going to work with a child hanging on you ''
_RARE_
want to keep this job , don't you ''
whether she heard him , over the running water
for a while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things -- a _RARE_ , a bottle of _RARE_ -- to take upstairs and pack
him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; ; it was something to do with her back , the _RARE_ of it , and the quick , _RARE_ way she bent
too young , that was all ; ; too young and thin and straight
''
Mr. Jack , _RARE_ out in the hall
through the swinging door
been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained
standing in front of the mirror , _RARE_ his tie
on his gray _RARE_ _RARE_ and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench
don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' , he said
coat looks like a _RARE_ heap ''
a few _RARE_ of _RARE_ on the shoulder
the _RARE_ out of the closet and went to work
Mr. Jack a real _RARE_ ; ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm _RARE_
''
cried when the brush _RARE_ his hat down over his eyes
and quickly set the hat right
stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his _RARE_ _RARE_
seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style
was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a _RARE_ of _RARE_ on his _RARE_
, he wouldn't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of _RARE_ old _RARE_
smoking _RARE_ , _RARE_ , wine , and blue , which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and _RARE_ in the closet
, Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat
out for those _RARE_ ''
him hurry down the drive to his car ; ; a handsome , _RARE_ man it made him proud to see
Jack drove away , Winston went on looking out the window
a _RARE_ of dirt on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ at it with his finger
looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy _RARE_ and the thick _RARE_ he used like a knife to _RARE_ up , _RARE_ , and open
first time , he be sad about the move
was ten years off his life let himself
handle and _RARE_ _RARE_ for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the _RARE_ flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the _RARE_
the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and _RARE_ and _RARE_ he had spent on keeping it up
ago , he had come to the house to be _RARE_
and the big pink _RARE_ had been _RARE_ along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing
had been out back , in a straw hat , _RARE_ flowers
talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed
been surprised at her for that
he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- _RARE_ yellow , if he remembered
had a dignity about her , even _RARE_ and almost too tan
, the flowers she had _RARE_ had spread all over the hill
_RARE_ were _RARE_ in a _RARE_ by the front gate , and the _RARE_ were coming on , blue by the porch steps
week the _RARE_ would _RARE_ out
_RARE_ in early May , for Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ party ; ; and after that the Japanese _RARE_
yard looked wet and _RARE_ , the trees bare under their _RARE_ , but in a while Miss _RARE_ flowers would _RARE_ like a marching parade
dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a _RARE_ with her writing on it ; ; where would she go for her _RARE_ now
didn't think she'd take to window _RARE_
he hurried to the living room
a thousand things to see to
he couldn't help thinking , we're all getting old , getting small ; ; the _RARE_ is pulling in her _RARE_
living room , Miss Ada was standing by the window with a _RARE_ of lists in her hand
looking out at the garden
'' , she said , `` get the basket for the _RARE_ ''
the big straw basket ready in the hall
it in and put it down beside her
was looking fine ; ; she had on her _RARE_ suit , blue , with _RARE_ binding
the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume
in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face
Miss Ada studied the list
, let's see
lemon tree
_RARE_ ''
her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and _RARE_ them in tissue paper
them trusted the _RARE_
came to Mr. Jack's photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a _RARE_ silver frame , Miss Ada said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won't take my _RARE_ ''
at Winston , and he saw the _RARE_ hard _RARE_ in her eyes
up the photograph and began to _RARE_ it
least you could leave it for the _RARE_ '' , Miss Ada said
possessed you to tell me a _RARE_ would be a good idea ''
the tissue paper carefully
used it every day ; ; every morning , I lay out his clothes on it ''
, that's over now
was his main present
fool picture out '' , she added sharply
it in the basket
Jack sets store by that ''
, Winston
meant to be my present ''
went on down the list
relieved ; ; those presents had been on his mind
only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the _RARE_ , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack
know what she _RARE_ , Winston '' , he had said wearily , one evening in November when Winston was pulling off his _RARE_
me what to get her for Christmas ''
been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him

picture of me ''
had persuaded him
night , they had had a _RARE_ about it
heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room
door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada
had come down ; ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown
do you like it ''
asked
had said , `` You look about fifteen years old ''
that a _RARE_ ''
don't know ''
stood at a little distance , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head
, you make me feel naked ''
had _RARE_ , and she went _RARE_ and rustling to the couch and sank down
look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started
a line , not a _RARE_
like an old man , compared '' , and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it
, an old man
wear pink when you're sixty ''
, I love that photograph
to put it on my _RARE_ ''
guess it's children make a woman old
gets old anyhow ''
minute he went on , `` People must think the _RARE_ is on me , seeing you fresh as an _RARE_ and me old and gray ''
give you a medical _RARE_ , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said

want is a picture -- with a few lines
man put them in if he has to ''
they had sat for five minutes without saying a word
Ada had stood up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs
love
no doubt that it was
rest of the summer my _RARE_ _RARE_ for making plaster _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ flowers and leaves was all but _RARE_ by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for _RARE_ and delight
all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound _RARE_ than the _RARE_ of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the _RARE_ of _RARE_ with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world
separation from them , in the railroad terminal across the river from New York , I would nearly cry
_RARE_ arms would seem _RARE_ , inadequate , _RARE_
year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had _RARE_ upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere _RARE_ or _RARE_ kitchen but by the _RARE_ obstacle of _RARE_ in _RARE_ distant _RARE_ , had agreed to _RARE_
became the center of my existence
to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to _RARE_ her letter for the _RARE_ time and finally prepare an answer
has _RARE_ for easy reference and _RARE_ the image of her pink , _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ , almost printed _RARE_ of her neat , _RARE_ _RARE_ with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when ; ; '' and others concerning camp friends who _RARE_ in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her _RARE_ again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her _RARE_ and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on _RARE_ , wounded , from the war in Europe
letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life
me was a foreign _RARE_ _RARE_ exciting _RARE_ and _RARE_ , full of _RARE_ and wit and _RARE_ , _RARE_ from the books I read , _RARE_ the grand _RARE_ of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , _RARE_ class I was enrolled
took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ -- he of the porch steps _RARE_ -- who smoked cigarettes , performed the _RARE_ , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do _RARE_ things with them
, in my _RARE_ , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely _RARE_ , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my _RARE_ _RARE_ , would guide her gently to the night's _RARE_ which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost _RARE_ one another to death with deep , moist _RARE_ burning with love
after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The _RARE_ , nearly dying , my head _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and Jessica _RARE_ over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life
nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ to fall into a deep sleep
went by , and the longer our separation grew , the more _RARE_ and almost unbearable my _RARE_ became
my love for Jessica to become _RARE_ and at the same time more _RARE_ , as if my _RARE_ self knew that only _RARE_ would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again
turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands
permission to give a camp _RARE_ party , she asked that I come and be her date
and , _RARE_ and nervous , all but made a fool of myself
those _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , I was shy with _RARE_ and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our _RARE_ , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance
standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft drinks to her guests
wearing her dark hair in two , thick _RARE_ to attain an `` American _RARE_ '' effect she thought was appropriate to _RARE_
her look sweet and _RARE_ , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it
moment did come that night when the _RARE_ letter writer and _RARE_ seemed to stride off my _RARE_ pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality
late , we were playing _RARE_ games , and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others
and were _RARE_ , and it turned out to be the _RARE_ brush of lips upon cheek
_RARE_ our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting _RARE_ of _RARE_ , all the mysterious _RARE_ that I had imagined a truly _RARE_ kiss would _RARE_ to me
at that party that , finally _RARE_ my _RARE_ , _RARE_ by _RARE_ only _RARE_ and _RARE_ among older boys , I asked _RARE_ to spend New _RARE_ _RARE_ with me
she accepted , and so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was , `` You're amazing , you know ''
we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night
write to one another and make a definite plan
terribly pleased
school and neighborhood friends , during the next months , I _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ described my _RARE_ date
I _RARE_ and gave off a _RARE_ front , I was beneath it all frightened
be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved
no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl , or how one behaved : Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street
bring along a _RARE_ or send one to her
_RARE_ to meet her at home or in the city
accompany her to the door of her home , or should I ask to be invited in
out , should I kiss her _RARE_
was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year
one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New _RARE_ _RARE_ , I knew for a moment an _RARE_ relief ; ; but the letter went on : she had cried , she had _RARE_ , she had been miserable at his refusal , and finally he had _RARE_ -- and now how happy she was , how _RARE_
gave me heart
confidence into myself
inquiries , I read a book of _RARE_
I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel _RARE_ , a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated
attend a film and , later on , I stated , we might go to the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ or _RARE_ or _RARE_ for _RARE_
the hour of our meeting for seven
o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a _RARE_
a new _RARE_ brown _RARE_ suit with a faint _RARE_ design and wide _RARE_ like a _RARE_ ears
leather _RARE_ , bulky with twisted , raised _RARE_ around the edges , I _RARE_ with money I had been saving
in an _RARE_ of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set out into the _RARE_ still streets of _RARE_
superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind , felt older than my years , and was full of _RARE_ for myself as I headed into the _RARE_ that was carrying its _RARE_ of _RARE_ out of that dull _RARE_ and into the unstable , _RARE_ excitement of Manhattan
, when I _RARE_ to it with my fellow _RARE_ _RARE_ ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ , with _RARE_ up _RARE_ and soldiers already hugging their girls and their _RARE_ bottles of whiskey
_RARE_ _RARE_ sat _RARE_ noble horses along the _RARE_ to prevent the _RARE_ from _RARE_ out in front of the crawling traffic
was cold but the crowd kept one warm
electric signs and _RARE_ were lit up for the first time since _RARE_ regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner
, _RARE_ for the _RARE_ tin models , were being _RARE_ and bought at _RARE_ stands every few yards along Broadway , and one's ears were continually _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
gentlemen next to me held a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to his lips and _RARE_ away at every fourth step and during the _RARE_ shouted out , `` V for _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ him on
a great sense of _RARE_
one join them
they all walking to
supposed to buy a funny hat and a _RARE_ for Jessica
a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other _RARE_ who had established the _RARE_ steps as the _RARE_ from which to _RARE_ their night of _RARE_
over their faces and felt a _RARE_ : they all looked so much more knowing than I
away
for Jessica to _RARE_ out of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a _RARE_ came to life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to _RARE_ Jessica
would we go after the movie
lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we couldn't get in
hadn't brought along enough money
for my _RARE_
, substantial _RARE_ _RARE_ me
I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong
father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave
this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to _RARE_ the plans
uneasy
me there was a _RARE_ _RARE_ of meetings taking place , like abrupt , _RARE_ scenes in old silent movies , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , enthusiastic _RARE_ into the _RARE_ night
were taking up new positions on the steps , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , while I stayed glued , like a _RARE_ , to one spot
two hotel _RARE_ came _RARE_ down the steps , carrying a _RARE_ to be set up as a _RARE_ in front of the _RARE_ store window next to the _RARE_ , and as I watched them in their _RARE_ red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd
almost stopped beating
_RARE_ patients on the bus the morning I left for Hanover , most of them disturbed and _RARE_
, a nurse and two _RARE_ were in charge of us
lonely and _RARE_ as I stared out the bus window at _RARE_ grim , dirty West _RARE_
incredible , as I listened to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of voices and smelled the _RARE_ _RARE_ coming from the patients , that _RARE_ I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the _RARE_ ill
thought of Mary Jane _RARE_ , the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger , her quiet competence , the _RARE_ and _RARE_ that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses
become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital
told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the _RARE_ stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in _RARE_ Field & Co.
that I lived at a good address on the _RARE_ Coast , that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies
also that I was _RARE_ and without a single known relative
quite sure that I felt enough _RARE_ about my drinking , or that I would not return to it once I was out and on my own again
worried her
read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had said
must have loved that girl very much , but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her ''
do you say that ''

wouldn't have gone into nursing if I didn't care about people
in every patient I've helped take care of

are young , intelligent , have a whole _RARE_ before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess it up with whiskey , indifference , _RARE_ attitudes
blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you
pretty ''
, yes '' , I said , feeling annoyed , `` she was very pretty
believe that I'm going back to medical school and finish , do you ''
should I
this ward for three months now
getting the same ones back again and again
mean well , have great promises to make when they are about to go home , but drinking is their _RARE_
seemed like them , but maybe you are
your stay here like a big joke
a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover
to go to college , too '' -- `` Why didn't you ''

has some of the best '' -- Her eyes flashed _RARE_
what I mean about you , _RARE_ '' , she said
don't seem to know much about reality
you why I didn't go to college ; ; I'm the _RARE_ of six children
a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year
no money for _RARE_ , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take for granted
here doesn't cost anything
pay me six dollars a month
it's a good deal
to become a good nurse , and I've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if I have to work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give it to them ''
you have a boy friend ''

none of your business '' , she said , then changed the subject
about your father and mother , don't you think of them when you're in a place like this ''
father and mother died when I was two years old '' , I said
_RARE_ raised me
died when I was doing my military service
no one but myself to worry about ''
my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly , and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face
sorry '' , she said
don't know what I'd do without my family
been so close ''
me more about them ''
became bright as she talked about her father and mother , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , cousins
I felt _RARE_ and lonely as only an _RARE_ can
had finished I said : `` Your _RARE_ sounds like a good father and a good policeman
he wouldn't be pleased if a _RARE_ like me were to ask his daughter for a date -- I mean , after I'm out of the hospital , a month or so from now ''
father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to _RARE_ for five years
pretty good judge of character , _RARE_
think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a _RARE_ in the future ''
about you
you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get through at Hanover ''
I thought you were serious about going back to school , that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover -- well , I might consider such an offer
your that girl you were going to kill ''
seemed very important to me that Mary Jane _RARE_ should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , _RARE_ person she believed me to be
are things about me that I can't tell you now , Mary Jane '' , I said , `` but if you'll go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover , I'd like to tell you the whole story
say this : I'm dead serious about going back to school
that other girl , let's just say that I never want to see her again
get to come home on long _RARE_ from Hanover , won't you ''
, I'll get one _RARE_ a month ''
go up to the _RARE_ Beach Hotel for dinner '' , I said
you like to dance
have a good orchestra ''
like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away
been anything really personal in her interest in me
that
just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there
riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before
the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me
a fantastic story
people in the state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name , or why
unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane _RARE_ would believe it without proof
had the proof , all _RARE_ in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so
bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order
suddenly as I listened to the _RARE_ _RARE_ coming from the patient behind me , if I had not perhaps imagined it all
was reality and _RARE_ Nelson , the actor , was _RARE_ ; ; a _RARE_ of Carl _RARE_ imagination
had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called _RARE_ Tony
a bad play , real _RARE_ _RARE_ , which only a _RARE_ of angels with _RARE_ dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into _RARE_
, not even the _RARE_ , had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway
it was a suspense _RARE_ story of the _RARE_ era , many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago , continue as a road company , and eventually become a movie
was completely _RARE_
literally screamed their indignation
was _RARE_ from the moment _RARE_ leveled on it in his _RARE_ column
on Friday and closed the following Monday
the entire cast I alone received good notices for my _RARE_ of a _RARE_ killer
me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company , two members of which were native _RARE_
paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York
lonely and _RARE_ as I packed my _RARE_ at the _RARE_ Hotel
to me that my life was _RARE_ to be one brilliant failure after another
been among the top third in my class at _RARE_ , had wanted desperately to go to medical school , but I'd run out of money and energy at the same time
I had quit my safe , secure _RARE_ spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play
to me that I was not only _RARE_ but quite stupid as well
that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a _RARE_ at Union News or _RARE_ while waiting for another acting job to open
occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting , that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life
the last bag and stood all three at the door for the _RARE_ to pick up , then went to the bathroom for a drink of water
rang
answered it a voice too _RARE_ and British to be real said , `` Is this Mr. _RARE_ Nelson , the actor ''
right '' , I said
don't you bastards lay off for a while ''
beg your _RARE_ , sir ''
right
_RARE_ Nelson the actor ''

you , Mr. Nelson , at the request of Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_
possibly have lunch with him today
could pick you up at your hotel at twelve ''

send the _RARE_ , of course ''
, of course , Mr. Nelson ''
to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung up
went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were _RARE_ their _RARE_ over the _RARE_ passing of _RARE_ Tony
_RARE_ low as I approached them
right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink ''
a _RARE_ on the bar and _RARE_ to the bartender to serve a round
just returned my change when the _RARE_ came in off the street to page me
over to him
Mr. Nelson ''

right ''
_RARE_ car is waiting for you at the east entrance ''
him out through the lobby to the street
_RARE_ , as _RARE_ impressive as the day it came off the ship , was parked at the curb
_RARE_ , _RARE_ in a dark uniform , stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car
giving the parked cars the _RARE_
with the license number _RARE_ _RARE_ was in stall number five
'' , I said to the attendant , `` I'll let you know if I close the deal on the office in this building ''
with him back to the entrance
me a ticket on the agency car and parked it
back in ten minutes
to get something out of the car '' , I told him , showing him my ticket
to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and said , `` Oh , yes
one I was talking to about a monthly _RARE_
right '' , I told him
the parking ticket , then looked at a _RARE_ and said , `` You're in the third row back toward the rear
find it all right ''
'' , I told him
back to the agency car and got out an electric _RARE_ , one of the _RARE_ devices for electronic _RARE_
keep a set in the car
in new _RARE_ so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking _RARE_ and stood looking at them thoughtfully
until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , then slipped around the back of the car with license number _RARE_ _RARE_ , attached the electronic _RARE_ to the rear _RARE_ and walked out
waved me on
the _RARE_ _RARE_ a detective has is hanging around on a city street , trying to make himself _RARE_ , keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting
first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window _RARE_ , then in people passing by
while , however , a _RARE_ mind gets fed up and that _RARE_ all of the _RARE_ physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment
to sit down
muscles and back muscles feel weary
of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city _RARE_ are hard
a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building
out alone
far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car
recognized me once more and said , `` What did you do about that office ''
haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said
a _RARE_
a couple of them I'm _RARE_ on ; ; one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking ''
curb parking is _RARE_ and _RARE_ , particularly when it _RARE_ '' , he said
trying to get him to take my money
'' , I told him
in a rush right now
where the car is
to drive it out ''
have one of the boys get it '' , he said
one of the rules on _RARE_
out their own cars ''
it as _RARE_ as you can , will you ''

, that's all right '' , he said
going to be a regular
in the office building here
want to _RARE_ a place way out in the sticks
business where the business is , not where it isn't ''
at him , handed him a couple of dollars and said , `` By the time you get the parking charge figured up , there should be a cigar in it for you ''
over to the agency heap , jumped in , started the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left
held up a bit trying to make a left turn
time I'd made it he was gone
pretty heavy
on the electric _RARE_ , and the signal came in loud and clear
time and picked him up within ten blocks
half a block behind him , letting lots of cars keep in between us , listening to the steady _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left
see him , but the electric _RARE_ device gave steady _RARE_ when it was straight ahead , short half _RARE_ when the car I was following was to the left , and long _RARE_ _RARE_ when it turned to the right
ever got behind me , the _RARE_ turned to a _RARE_
left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right
while the signal became a _RARE_ and I knew he was behind me
he'd parked _RARE_
a big circle until I located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house
a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited
was in the apartment house for two hours
came out and started driving toward the beach
time it was dark
get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic
would have been a _RARE_ if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner
I'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic _RARE_ device
was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a _RARE_
the block and found he was in the parking lot of a _RARE_ restaurant
where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry
there with the faint odor of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ my _RARE_ and occasionally _RARE_ the _RARE_ of coffee
came out an hour later , drove to the beach , turned right and after half a mile went to the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front
it was the _RARE_ Tom place
until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register
the man I was _RARE_ had filled out was still on the counter
that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of _RARE_ L. _RARE_ and wife , giving a San Francisco address
written out the license number of his car but had _RARE_ the last two figures , an old _RARE_ which is still good
out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't check the license number on the plates against the license number the _RARE_ _RARE_ out
does , it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the _RARE_ of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake
the _RARE_ of Robert C. _RARE_ , gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap , but a couple of phony numbers in between
have written anything
of the motel was a woman who apparently didn't care
_RARE_ with the law in regard to _RARE_ but she certainly wasn't _RARE_ license numbers or bothering the tenants
mean you're all alone , Mr. _RARE_ ''
right ''
wife isn't going to join you -- later ''
don't think so ''
you expect her to show up '' , she said , `` you'd better put ' and wife ' on there
_RARE_ , you know ''
difference in the rate ''

to you '' , she said smiling
ten dollars either way
ice _RARE_ in a container at the far end and in another by the office
three _RARE_ _RARE_ machines , and if you should be joined by -- anybody -- try to keep things quiet , if you will
to run a nice quiet place ''
you '' , I told her
another _RARE_ glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car
was reasonably solid ; ; not like the _RARE_ construction of so many of the motel units that have _RARE_ all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the _RARE_ apartment
a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side I wanted to case
aid of that I could hear my man moving around , heard him cough a couple of times , heard the toilet flush , heard the sound of water running
companion was going to be , she was going to join him later
where to come
have to telephone
so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been _RARE_
thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply _RARE_ a meal , but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's _RARE_ down for the night , hunger can be a _RARE_ _RARE_
noticed a _RARE_ down the road a quarter of a mile
on the _RARE_ device I had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals
_RARE_ I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation , and I was _RARE_ _RARE_ I was so hungry
in the car , drove down to the _RARE_ and ordered a couple of _RARE_ with everything included , a cup of coffee and the _RARE_ service possible
wasn't particularly busy at that time of night , and the girl who was waiting on me , who was _RARE_ in the _RARE_ pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be _RARE_
really in a hurry , _RARE_ ''

in a hurry , _RARE_ ''
early in the evening to be in a hurry
of time left ''
may not be any women left '' , I said
a little _RARE_ and said , `` I don't get off work until eleven o'clock
my evening _RARE_ ''
be here at _RARE_ '' , I said
, you
announced
what they all say
thing going _RARE_ in your car ''
`` _RARE_ it , that's the automatic signal that shows when the _RARE_ key is on
turn it off ''
over and switched off the electronic _RARE_ device
in to get the _RARE_ , and I switched on the device again and kept the signal from _RARE_ car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the _RARE_
shut off the device again
to hang around while I was eating
you think it's _RARE_ to have dinner before you go to pick her up ''
'' , I said
a _RARE_ to her
, she's on a diet
just a _RARE_ and cottage cheese _RARE_ and I'm to have one with her so she won't feel out of place ''
can be terrible '' , the girl said
much _RARE_ is she ''
a bit '' , I said , `` but she's keeping her figure in hand ''
at me _RARE_
figures should be kept in hand '' , she said , and walked away with an exaggerated _RARE_
on the device again , half _RARE_ that I might find silence , but the _RARE_ came in loud and clear
switched on the lights for her to come and get the check , I had the exact change plus a dollar tip
man said , `` All we _RARE_ do is go around the corner ''
moved
man said , `` _RARE_ ''
second building on the right ''
it says police right on the door ''
so even if we was as dumb as you take us for , we could still find it ''
Dave began to back toward the door
man waved the gun again
, `` Right around the corner ''
says water works , but there is a policeman on duty , too ''
night policeman just like in the States
''
doesn't have much of this here _RARE_ _RARE_ problem , but we keep a night policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists ''
door , Dave paused to feel for the _RARE_
up at her husband
going to be _RARE_ and not try to do anything _RARE_ with that gun pointed at him
the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun , measured the distance from the men to the back room
to risk it
something phony about all this gun waving -- something not quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police
the _RARE_ under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open
flash she was away to the back , paying no attention to three angry _RARE_ from the male _RARE_
open the back door
dark inside the room but enough light _RARE_ from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top
a small _RARE_ with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs
turned to face the men again
the counter was on his feet
between where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles
frightened gaze on the men at the counter , she began to feel her way to the door
along the _RARE_ one step at a time
followed her
reached Dave and felt his arm go around her , felt him pull her to the safety of his person , she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to Lauren
men watched as Dave closed the door behind them , watched them cross the sidewalk to their car
getting light
man removed his apron , put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket , and _RARE_ it over his _RARE_
man moved swiftly to the phone and _RARE_ a number
was answered , he said , `` Albert

you a couple of customers -- yeah -- just get them out of my hair and keep them out -- I don't give a damn what you tell them -- only don't believe a word they say -- they're out to make trouble for me and it is up to you to stop them -- I don't care how -- and one more thing -- _RARE_ _RARE_ closed at eleven like always last night and Rose and _RARE_ _RARE_ left for _RARE_ yesterday -- some _RARE_ or other -- I think it was called _RARE_ _RARE_ -- yeah , yesterday
''
from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant
_RARE_ hadn't moved away yet

of worry formed , a _RARE_ pulled his mouth over to one side
, `` Grosse
kidding me -- the kid don't know the name of this town ''
ain't kidding you , Vince
she
been walking in her sleep -- you seen her yourself in here ''
I know ''
how she looked when Barney held the door for her
a _RARE_
just waking up when we found her at the garage ''

_RARE_ -- ain't got enough brains between the two of you '' -- Grosse muttered , his head down , one hand playing with the _RARE_ on his jacket
had enough brains to call _RARE_ up so as _RARE_ could do _RARE_ about it when the parents -- I _RARE_ let her go go '' -- His eyes were lowered , so he couldn't have seen the narrow , pointed face of his companion suddenly _RARE_ with fury ; ; but he was aware of it just the same
Vince _RARE_ was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be
_RARE_ , Vince seized the thing nearest , a glass sugar container with a _RARE_ metal top , and threw it against the wall opposite
glass didn't break , but the top flew off ; ; sugar _RARE_ with a _RARE_ that was loud in the silence
startled , but careful to appear so , Grosse _RARE_ _RARE_ on his pipe
steadily
does everything have to happen to me ''
got a _RARE_ and started to _RARE_ up the sugar
him
worked over the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ in his vocabulary
said , `` _RARE_ hell didn't you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off
and Barney ever use your brains ''
man didn't answer
one of the _RARE_ and brushed the _RARE_ sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter
the _RARE_ to its place between _RARE_ bottle and paper _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_
don't know nothing about them cars
she's in a ordinary garage ''
do you know , stupid
_RARE_ gun back ''
know ''
the gun under the counter
one word of this gets to _RARE_ '' -- `` Who's telling _RARE_ ''
again
get that kid over to _RARE_ house ''
man _RARE_
a finger down his cheek , tracing the scratch there
can't I leave her locked up in the tool _RARE_ ''
man stopped his _RARE_ long enough to glance at the clock
and Barney get her over to _RARE_ before it gets too light
left , we'll _RARE_ the kid somewhere near the _RARE_ where she _RARE_ get home
you if she knows where she's been ''
his hands
am I going to do with her all day
tool _RARE_ she can't get away ''
the hell do I care what you do with her all day
her where _RARE_ won't see her and start asking questions ''
now
all , Vince
no baby _RARE_ ''
finally , `` Get her over to _RARE_ and I'll come by and see that she _RARE_ put ''
the bridge of his nose where it was swollen
_RARE_
don't _RARE_ get _RARE_
you luck when you try _RARE_ that kid ''
grinned
lost its sullen tones and he chuckled
got one question ''
is it ''

you a poor dumb _RARE_ or a smart _RARE_ from the States ''
his hand as if to strike , but his thin lips spread in a smile
and _RARE_
you say you was born ''
a Chicago _RARE_ just like you
ain't going back there on account of one lousy kid ''
rubbed her face against the blanket
cried a little because she was frightened
easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car ( she had figured that out ) , but she couldn't understand their subsequent actions
because she had shown panic
blame her for that
one thing to _RARE_ outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to _RARE_ in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you
glad the fat man had left
not really _RARE_
as the little man now appeared at the window and , reaching through the opening , offered her a bottle of _RARE_
at him _RARE_
found she was _RARE_ , she was about to refuse ( never , never take _RARE_ from a strange man ) when she saw the bottle was _RARE_
a bottle _RARE_ on the counter
he understood her panic
her nose on a tissue and opened the _RARE_ bottle
icy cold and tasted _RARE_
a lift in spirit
was finished she pushed it back
was busy doing something to the inside of the _RARE_ on the _RARE_ side of a car
softly , `` Barney ''
in her direction but he didn't answer
, `` Barney , why is he keeping me here ''
answer
to be looking at a point above the little window
, `` Why can't I call my home
some money from someone and go home by bus
send the money right back ''
the cigarette he had been smoking
it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe
looked at her
, `` I only work here ''
, `` Please ''
was back at work on a car
her head on her arms on the counter
he be kind one moment and cruel the next
know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her
he afraid to do anything as definite as _RARE_ her
was _RARE_ painfully ; ; the unknown was so much worse than -- what _RARE_ lay ahead for her
thing had she to face in the next few hours
and hot was _RARE_ on her _RARE_

sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself ; ; as long as she could do nothing _RARE_ about the situation she was in , she would think about something else
and father , for instance
they now
mind she followed the white _RARE_ along the road somewhere between here and the _RARE_ River
attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldn't _RARE_ an inch until he crossed the bridge at the _RARE_ and took the River Road to _RARE_ and , finally , turned in at their own driveway at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
would _RARE_ and stretch and shout , `` All out
the end of the line ''
would her mother be doing right now
would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful , big , safe , solid shoulder next to her on the front seat
was in trouble and she was alone
put her hand on her husband's arm as he slid in the _RARE_ seat beside her
were _RARE_ calling , were answered
_RARE_ so that she made three attempts at speech before she became _RARE_

that woman's apron behind the door
a wet spot -- she couldn't have been gone long ''
some sound meant to _RARE_ agreement
the car key in the lock
violently trembling
, `` You heard what he said about police
we drive around the corner ''
door crashed shut
_RARE_ into life
, `` I got the message
''
, `` no


comes looking for us
sit here in the car while you walk around the corner ''
car sprang away from the curb like something alive
, `` I'm not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those '' -- Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling
were _RARE_ by _RARE_ of _RARE_ beard
, mean eyes regarded Marty steadily , _RARE_
were _RARE_ by little _RARE_ of red as if tiny _RARE_ had burst and _RARE_ blood into them
_RARE_ his _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ breath , Marty _RARE_ the _RARE_ of bad whiskey
the man
driven the car that passed them on the road outside _RARE_ place
_RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ joint
at _RARE_ pleasantly and said , `` There was a cab waiting for me here
know where it might have gone ''
his _RARE_ , his jaw moving in a steady rhythm
straight at Marty
not answer
the faces of the others nearest him , looked into their staring eyes
anyone see my cab ''
, keeping his voice casual
showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him
have to get back to Jarrodsville '' , he went on
see there are some cars here
if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town
happy to pay for the favor , of course ''
men stood and stared at him for a moment longer
a startling thing occurred
so utterly unexpected that Marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open _RARE_ after it had happened
no word spoken , no apparent signal given
men all moved at the same instant
into the waiting cars , _RARE_ roared , the cars sped off
wagon and the old Plymouth headed east toward Jarrodsville
and the pickup truck sped west toward _RARE_ _RARE_
all four cars were out of sight
stood alone on a _RARE_ road as storm clouds gathered _RARE_ in the sky again
great distance thunder _RARE_ and broke the silence
back toward the _RARE_ house
he saw a pale face at a window
was _RARE_ May
would be glad that they hadn't hurt him
other _RARE_ nearby
road there was one no more than a hundred yards away
another on this side , a little further down
many more between here and Jarrodsville
lined the road
tall and _RARE_
stretched out into _RARE_
single _RARE_ of wire reached into the silent houses beside the _RARE_ road
nothing he could do but walk
was more than three miles away , down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a _RARE_
east and started walking down the left side of the road
had proceeded a few feet , he paused and turned up the _RARE_ of his trousers , which were already damp and _RARE_
mud was _RARE_ , and in places great _RARE_ spread across the road and reflected the _RARE_ light
approached the first farmhouse , thunder sounded behind him again , closer now and louder , like a steadily _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
several people on the porch of the farmhouse
a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from _RARE_ to _RARE_
an instant he thought of _RARE_ to them for help
had a car or truck and would drive him into town
realized the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the idea
staring at him in the same blank and _RARE_ way that the men outside the gate had stared
eyes of the smallest children seemed _RARE_
side of the road there were two farm hands , well back in a field , leaning against a plow
too , stared at him
of thunder were right behind him now
thought came into his head
a story he had read as a youth
probably one of _RARE_ _RARE_ of the British Army
an officer who had been _RARE_ and _RARE_ out
roll of the _RARE_ had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded , and each man _RARE_ and turned his back as the officer approached
these poor farm people would turn their backs
by the _RARE_ ended
dirt highway was _RARE_ on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch , too broad to _RARE_ over unless you were an _RARE_ star
rain had been added to the _RARE_ water
_RARE_ on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car
coming toward him
was now in sight
skipped a beat when he recognized it
the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road , the station wagon that had been parked at the _RARE_ farm
station wagon
headed back toward Jarrodsville
only been a _RARE_ to _RARE_ him out on the deserted road
and his friends were returning to seek him out
wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him , beside a _RARE_ field
was another sound
car was coming from the west , from the direction of _RARE_ _RARE_
the Ford that had been outside _RARE_ farm
_RARE_ in both directions
a narrow road , barely wide enough for two cars to pass
not leave the road because of the _RARE_ drainage ditch
two cars were _RARE_ from him , the station wagon started up again and the Ford gathered speed
down on him
nothing he could do except jump into the ditch
, and sank to his knees in muddy water
two cars roared by , there was a _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ sound
how the Union soldiers must have felt at _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ when the ragged gray ranks charged at them , screaming the wild _RARE_ _RARE_ they called the Rebel yell
he stood in water , shivering and _RARE_ for breath
turned his ankle slightly , and it _RARE_ him
, with their load of _RARE_ men , had disappeared in the distance
been two more cars parked at the farm , a Plymouth and a pickup truck
be coming for him next , bearing down on him from both directions
the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again
be _RARE_ repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time , all the way to Jarrodsville
had three miles to go
the more _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , who could afford _RARE_ _RARE_ instead of switch _RARE_ as _RARE_ weapons , played this same game and called it `` _RARE_ ''
not go through the fields
was _RARE_ on both sides of the road by a high _RARE_ fence
to make for the section of road just ahead that was _RARE_ by the rail fence , the section by the farmhouse
he could climb up on the fence when his _RARE_ roared by again
place could not be far now
go in there , climb through the window , and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest
even a bare chance that the phone had not been _RARE_
not dare climb back up to the road
deep in water , but at least they could not reach him there
on , mud sucking at his feet with each step , until he reached the end of the drainage ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm
back to the road , and he felt utterly exhausted
, panting , for a moment
he saw something that he had not seen before , and panic gripped him again
, his only _RARE_ when the metal death came _RARE_ at him , was made of rails , all right , but the rails were protected by a thick _RARE_ of barbed wire that would _RARE_ his flesh if he pressed against it
on down the road _RARE_ , because there was no place else to go
all sense of dignity
not stand on dignity when you were _RARE_ and _RARE_ and your life was at stake
were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse , too , but he did not bother to look
into a _RARE_ , breathing heavily , _RARE_ with sweat
to reach _RARE_ place
his only _RARE_
on both sides of the road _RARE_ with the barbed wire
stretched on _RARE_
he heard them
he saw them
was coming at him from the east , the pickup truck from the west
timed it better this time
reach him at almost exactly the same instant
_RARE_
backed against the fence , one of the cars would brush him as it passed , and he would be _RARE_ _RARE_ by the wire
to the middle of the road and simply stood there , waiting for them , a perfect target
must have had their gas _RARE_ pushed down to the floor boards
coming on at _RARE_ speed for such old vehicles
at him
his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible
Plymouth _RARE_ , it _RARE_ toward him and seemed about to run him down
himself to stay frozen there
moved , he would be in the path of the other car
the _RARE_ of the Plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by
fraction of a second the pickup truck _RARE_ by on the other side
, insane sound of the Rebel yell _RARE_ again and _RARE_ from the distant hills
not leave the middle of the road
not try to run
on , his _RARE_ eyes focused straight ahead
_RARE_ the _RARE_ house
going to make it , he told himself
he heard a car coming from the east , and he felt as if he would break down and weep
, no , not again '' , he said aloud
again so soon ''
a new sound , a sound as _RARE_ as the Rebel yell , yet different
the sound of a _RARE_
saw that the approaching car was painted white , and he began to wave his arms frantically
the _RARE_ car from the _RARE_ office
drew up alongside him and stopped
in '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ said _RARE_
into the back seat and lay back , fighting for breath
someone in front with the sheriff
Pete _RARE_ , the _RARE_
around and said to Marty , `` I guess you think I'm a _RARE_ _RARE_
wasn't no use in me _RARE_ there
fight a dozen or so of 'em
stayed , all that I'd have got was four _RARE_ tires and one _RARE_ head
you wait at the _RARE_ house
known I'd gone to get the sheriff
lucky they let me go , I guess ''
was occupied with _RARE_ the car around in a very narrow space
was finally pointed east , he said , `` You should never have come out here alone
_RARE_ country
in every one of these houses is a Night _RARE_
turned the telephone over to Rourke , and went into the bedroom to change his _RARE_ for dry _RARE_ and shoes
talking on the phone when he came back
an hour , _RARE_
positive ''
a moment and then said , `` Hold it ''
his head and said , `` _RARE_ will definitely be in a back room at the _RARE_ _RARE_ Club on South Beach within an hour
try and meet him there ''
at his watch
too far from Fifth Street , and should allow him to make Scotty's Bar by midnight
with satisfaction , `` That's fine , Tim
there ''
the appointment over the phone and hung up
don't know what you're getting into , Mike '' , he said _RARE_
hope to Christ
said _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ another drink if you want it
one other call to make before I meet _RARE_ ''
''
out in the _RARE_ section
got my car here ''
parked in front ''
_RARE_ whiskey into his glass on top of _RARE_ _RARE_
better keep on driving yours '' , Shayne decided , `` because I'll be going on over to the Beach
drop you back here to pick mine up ''
to a closet to get a light jacket , and took his hat from beside the door
_RARE_ down the whiskey hastily and joined him , asking , `` Who are we going to call on in the _RARE_ section ''
lady
, maybe not too much of a lady
, I want to find out whether she's home yet or not ''
the door and followed Rourke out
car , Shayne drove east to _RARE_ Boulevard and north toward _RARE_ _RARE_ address which had been given to him by the _RARE_ _RARE_
drove , he filled in _RARE_ Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the _RARE_ house , and on his own _RARE_
want to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when _RARE_ makes her phone call there '' , he ended grimly
don't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not , but I want to see who takes the call ''
deal at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ where the two _RARE_ jumped you '' , said Rourke with interest , `` that sounds like it was set up with _RARE_ _RARE_ by the _RARE_ Mrs. _RARE_ , doesn't it ''
does '' , Shayne grunted _RARE_ , still able to taste her mouth on his in the Green _RARE_ parking lot
story of hers about an _RARE_ note _RARE_ her to be there tonight sounds completely phony
was designed to put me on the spot , it would have to have been written before _RARE_ ever called me in on the case ''
you think Laura did have the _RARE_ _RARE_ made without her husband's knowledge ''
haven't the _RARE_ idea
her husband strongly _RARE_ so , and that's why he called me in on the thing in direct _RARE_ of his _RARE_ and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so
_RARE_ street ''
, peering ahead at the partially _RARE_ street sign
see it better out the _RARE_ side , and he said , `` yes
the left , I think , for that number you gave me
than a block or so ''
in the _RARE_ _RARE_ and cut across the Boulevard _RARE_
a small , _RARE_ restaurant and _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet , _RARE_ street where most of the houses on both sides were older _RARE_ _RARE_ , now cut up into furnished rooms and _RARE_ apartments
_RARE_ from the Boulevard slowly , letting Rourke _RARE_ his head out the window and watch for street numbers
automobile was parked _RARE_ up the block on the _RARE_ side
_RARE_ that it carried _RARE_ Beach license plates as he approached , and then saw the _RARE_ of a match in the front seat as they passed , indicating that it was occupied
to see the _RARE_ faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke said , `` It's the next house , Mike
right ''
pulling into the curb , Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left
around the corner and parked , turning off his lights and motor
told you , Mike '' , said Rourke in an _RARE_ voice
was back there
said , `` I know it was , Tim ''
was _RARE_ and cold
you see the car parked across the street ''
didn't notice it
watching for numbers
It has a Beach license , Tim
in the front seat
a quick look at their faces as we went past
crazy as hell , they're two of _RARE_ _RARE_
named Harris and Geely
mean anything to you ''
a minute , Mike

nodded grimly

_RARE_ , I suppose

out and walk around the block back to the _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_
on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there

show their hands
are Beach cops on a _RARE_ , they'll admit it to a reporter
no official standing on this side of the Bay
as you find out if they are Geely and Harris , come on around to the _RARE_ where I'll be waiting ''
the door on his side and stepped out
_RARE_ _RARE_ as he slid under the wheel
things you talk me into , Mike
chuckled
often do they add up to _RARE_
_RARE_ ''
the street and walked swiftly _RARE_ to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant
standing at the end of the bar enjoying a _RARE_ of _RARE_ when Rourke came in six or eight minutes later
nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar
the bartender , `` _RARE_ and water '' , and Rourke told him , `` It's those two , all right
Geely
them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on _RARE_ Perrin ''
_RARE_ , `` I've got it all worked out , Tim
time with your drink
it
three minutes , go in that phone _RARE_ behind you and call Police _RARE_
and don't identify yourself
that a couple of _RARE_ are having a hell of a fight down the street , and they better send a patrol car
up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address
waiting for you there ''
brought _RARE_ drink and Shayne laid a _RARE_ bill on the bar
in a low voice , `` I've got a date with a lady , Mister
pay for a pint I can take with me
how it is '' , he added with a _RARE_ wink
is _RARE_ , but liquor is _RARE_ and you don't have any _RARE_ for sale here anyhow ''
sure don't ''
winked back at him and _RARE_ the bill
away and returned in a moment with a pint of _RARE_ in a small paper _RARE_ which he slid over the counter to Shayne
detective slid it into his pocket , Rourke asked sadly , `` What in hell are you going to do , Mike ''
a couple of _RARE_ detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God they'd stayed out of my way this afternoon
, Tim ''
out _RARE_ , and Rourke checked his watch and _RARE_ his drink , getting a _RARE_ ready to make the telephone call to the police
Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his _RARE_ directly in front of the bar headed south
over to the _RARE_ door , opened it and got the _RARE_ automatic out of the _RARE_ compartment and put it in his _RARE_ pocket
he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives , but its weight was comforting at his _RARE_
side of the Bay , _RARE_ Beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen , and _RARE_ pistol permit was just as good as theirs
swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat
the _RARE_ of his hat low as he approached , stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the _RARE_ side
, _RARE_ man named Geely was on that side , _RARE_ in the seat toward his _RARE_ companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door
the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night
and slid partly out , and _RARE_ left arm _RARE_ in around his neck to help him , while he set himself solidly on the _RARE_ and swung his right fist to the big , _RARE_ jaw before Geely could _RARE_ up
back to let him _RARE_ to the ground , and then _RARE_ over him through the open door into Harris who was _RARE_ loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster , somewhat _RARE_ by the steering wheel
his big hands around _RARE_ thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the _RARE_
him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp
him into the street a couple of feet away from _RARE_ _RARE_ figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side
_RARE_
both breathing heavily , out cold , and Shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him
the pint of liquor out of his pocket and _RARE_ the top , _RARE_ the _RARE_ stuff _RARE_ over both men , and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat
, then , to look toward the lighted Boulevard , and saw _RARE_ tall , _RARE_ figure come out of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ start to angle across the street toward the opposite side
across to _RARE_ the reporter in front of the _RARE_ house where _RARE_ Perrin lived , and asked casually , `` Get the police okay ''

have a patrol car here fast
inside
with you ''
the two damned _RARE_ got all excited when they saw the bottle , and knocked each other out cold '' , Shayne said _RARE_
have fun explaining that to the _RARE_ cops
business over here on a _RARE_ anyway ''
up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling
of _RARE_ along the wall had numbers and names on them
one marked Perrin Aj
on the right was dark , but there was a _RARE_ at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top , and they went up
two front rooms , both dark behind their _RARE_ , and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the _RARE_ were awake
nine steps above him , Roberts had paused
with him , waiting , no longer impatient , trying now to think it out , do a little planning
down over the _RARE_ at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set
could call in , they could check the story while we were on our way
have to tell them I had Roberts -- Then he heard it , like a muffled _RARE_ , felt a subtle change in air pressure
up in time to see Roberts _RARE_ down on him from above , literally flying through the air , his _RARE_ face twisted
to _RARE_ against the _RARE_ , gripped it with one hand , but Roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the _RARE_
for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail
with Roberts , helpless and in agony , over and over , down the steps
_RARE_ effort , he managed to hunch and draw in , to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head
_RARE_ in his mind and , for a moment , helpless on the lobby floor , but he was conscious , and free of the weight of Roberts' body
vision cleared he saw the taller one _RARE_ upward , reaching
on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand
his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand
fixed on the _RARE_ feet , which would first _RARE_ the moment and direction of an attack
stiffly , forcing his knees to lock
pain in his _RARE_ nearly brought him down again
himself back off slowly , his eyes _RARE_ on Roberts , who now had no more to lose than he
_RARE_ as he moved , and he _RARE_ inside
moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled
on '' , he said
want to be that big a fool -- I was hoping for this ''
at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps
the razor well out to one side
_RARE_ to attack , but he could be handled , Mickey knew , if he could be brought to make the first move
eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step
with _RARE_ arms
time , Roberts '' , he said
would it be easier if I put my hands in my pockets ''
was lost on Roberts
slowly , directly , giving no hint of a _RARE_ to either side
just short of _RARE_ reach when he stopped
off two steps , forcing him to come on again
a fixed grin on Roberts' face , made hideous by the swollen nose and the _RARE_ blood
off again and Roberts hesitated , then came along
in a series of _RARE_ _RARE_ and starts , a _RARE_ dance -- two steps back , two steps forward , two steps back
his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door
going to be it now , any second , and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor , no matter what , even if Roberts should _RARE_ with a kick to the _RARE_ , the deadly hand was his exclusive concern
came , sudden and vicious but short
twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon
in a silver arc toward his throat , then _RARE_ downward
his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' _RARE_ with his own , felt the blade slide off his sleeve
could move inside to cut upward toward his face , he slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly
and slashed at him wildly
Mickey _RARE_ and fell to one side , landing heavily on the wood floor
was on him , _RARE_ for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade
it _RARE_ at the side of his jacket and a _RARE_ _RARE_ under his left ribs
a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and _RARE_ him clear , then scrambled to his feet
in the center of the lobby now
the razor , Roberts came up into a _RARE_ , shaking his head
charged Mickey was ready
Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him _RARE_ , then _RARE_ in _RARE_
right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smashed at the _RARE_ face
backward , his back _RARE_ , fought for balance and , failing , stumbled against the _RARE_ post at the foot of the stairs
of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , _RARE_ sound
on his side across the lowest step , rolled over once , then lay still
himself leaning against the desk , with stiff hands , panting for breath
minute he went to Roberts , looked at one of his eyes and felt for a _RARE_
feel any
to be dead ; ; if not yet , then soon , very soon
was cold in the lobby
seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do
was no more than eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning came to this : There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two -- _RARE_ and the one who hired the two of them -- from finding out about Roberts and _RARE_ out
law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more than that
have to
they could never catch up with the others
other way ; ; I'll have to do it myself
at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step
sure now he was dead
, he thought , nobody knows about it yet

the stairs , went into Roberts' room , found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could
a few things
have to be perfect
a _RARE_
on impulse , he might logically leave behind what it was _RARE_ to carry
had closed the suitcase he found a _RARE_ and moved about the room , _RARE_ carefully everything he might have touched
him nearly an hour
to the room he had _RARE_ and got into his _RARE_
the rest of his things and returned to the lobby
Roberts' suitcase near the front door , went outside and walked back to the garage
_RARE_ surprised to find it was _RARE_
softly , silently , an _RARE_ _RARE_ of his vision against the night sky
feel it on his face and in his hair
the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes
backed out and swung around to the front drive
into the hotel and _RARE_ till he found the razor
it in his own pocket for _RARE_
the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat
went back for Roberts
was heavier than he had anticipated
it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep
it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out , then returned to the porch and closed the front door , making sure it was unlocked
carefully in the direction of the brief _RARE_ they had taken earlier
continuously , but quietly , _RARE_
reached the _RARE_ in the woods , he saw that already the earlier _RARE_ were barely _RARE_
fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground
in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the _RARE_ mine
facing it and left the headlights on , but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase , he found the _RARE_ extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage
back and got the flashlight , returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier
the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it
dust settled , he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder
like carrying the suitcase
snow was _RARE_ _RARE_
nearly fell
passage , he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his _RARE_ burden
time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back _RARE_ under the drag of the dead weight
looking down for a few seconds , then backed up two or three _RARE_ from the edge
too much weight casually to _RARE_ it away
feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out
be a bad place to die
a bad place for Roberts to wind up , but Roberts had asked for it
too late to worry about that
slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel
a relief to get rid of the weight
shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down
got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge
_RARE_ on the point of dropping off
it a strong push , heard it slide , then _RARE_ _RARE_ into the hole
to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit
lay in an awkward _RARE_ twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor
, he decided
little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter
signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow , probably by the next day
cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact
it would be a _RARE_
his way back to the Jeep
started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket
down , went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit
on Roberts' sprawled right _RARE_ , poised _RARE_ , then slid off to the ground
back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel
garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it
_RARE_ here and there and he cleaned them off , using an _RARE_ _RARE_ he found on a _RARE_
the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep
the flashlight where it had been _RARE_ , got into his own car and backed it out of the garage
tire marks where it had been , but they were _RARE_ by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny
, he thought , might spend some time _RARE_ for her lost _RARE_ , but he doubted that she would _RARE_ an investigation
her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense
would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run away
in a call to _RARE_ from his hotel room
answered and he decided _RARE_ must be at work
him not to be too hopeful and then , _RARE_ his own advice , said excitedly , `` But it does sound good
named _RARE_ who tells nobody anything about herself
picture with the same _RARE_ ''
not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm
you in a day or so ''
highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake _RARE_ and along the coast
was ten miles _RARE_ -- more of a _RARE_ old coast town than those along the beach made _RARE_ by tourist _RARE_
into a motel and drove downtown
was a _RARE_ building _RARE_ the customary _RARE_
the usual _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and patches of bare dirt in most _RARE_ squares , the building was _RARE_ in by a _RARE_ growth of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and a smooth lawn the _RARE_ _RARE_ shade of _RARE_ grass
his best bet was a call on the sheriff
in the outer office took him in to _RARE_ _RARE_ , a big , _RARE_ man with thick , white hair and a voice with a _RARE_ resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office
front of the desk , Hank said , `` I'm looking for some information with very little to go on , _RARE_ ''
the background of the case , ending with the _RARE_ clue which had brought him to Gulf _RARE_
_RARE_ chair tilted back
you're looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been _RARE_
was such a person , I'm afraid she got away with it
don't know more about him
the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the _RARE_ match with the _RARE_ a little later
a _RARE_ job , but if you want to try it , the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county _RARE_ office ''
the society editor would remember a _RARE_ _RARE_ bride ''
an idea
has been society editor here for twenty-five years
says that marriages may be made in heaven , but _RARE_ are made in Mrs. _RARE_ columns
one who _RARE_ which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper and all that ''

, when the editor was just out of the hospital from a _RARE_ operation , Mrs. Calhoun and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out beside his bed
sure to remember any bride who was vague about background
made a great _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ down _RARE_ and environment
remember if the _RARE_ died later ''
up
wish you good luck , but please don't dig up too tough a case for me this close to election
find out anything , come on back here and we'll get started on it ''
Mrs. Calhoun was like trying to catch up with _RARE_ _RARE_ between _RARE_ and _RARE_
out that she also sold real estate , _RARE_ , and hospital insurance
_RARE_ stretched into the afternoon -- from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper , where he found her at five o'clock
a large woman with a _RARE_ gray _RARE_ cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and _RARE_ on an old typewriter
a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted
year
I do remember one
_RARE_
man named _RARE_ Black
her because she didn't want her picture in the paper
like that I've seen in twenty-five years ''
reason did she give ''
she had a _RARE_ on her face -- some sort of _RARE_ -- and none of her old pictures was good enough
see her till several days later at the wedding , and her face looked like it had never had a _RARE_ on it
of course , you couldn't see too well through the _RARE_ ''
her name _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
how in hell would I remember that ''
mind
look it up
still live here ''
think they moved away shortly after they were married
a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred
it'll be in the files
run a social note when somebody moves away ''
up and _RARE_ her
they inherited some money or something ''
with a _RARE_ _RARE_ in her eye
vaguely , `` Well , it is a little legal matter , but nothing like that ''
across to the _RARE_ and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving
like what you're after '' , he said when Hank had finished
on , let's hurry down before they lock up for the day ''
basement the sheriff took him to a small , _RARE_ office occupied by a tall , thin man _RARE_ in _RARE_ shirt _RARE_
_RARE_ Hirey _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the board of _RARE_
is a private detective , Hirey
look up something in the newspaper files , so don't lock him in here ''

built the new jail , we used to keep prisoners in here _RARE_ sometimes when the old jail got too crowded
himself a lot better than we do prisoners
a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from _RARE_ air _RARE_ coming through the _RARE_ ''
past the sheriff into a _RARE_ room with _RARE_ full of big , _RARE_ volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls
table and four chairs stood in the center
all here , back to _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ told him
all right to smoke , but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave
of course , you know not to take _RARE_ ''
leave the air _RARE_ on for you , Mr. _RARE_ '' , said Hirey

them and promised to observe the rules
had gone , he stood for a minute breathing in the _RARE_ of old paper and leather which the _RARE_ _RARE_ air _RARE_ couldn't quite _RARE_
In a _RARE_ around the _RARE_ , he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed _RARE_ around the room
weakness for _RARE_ in records rose up to _RARE_ him
, indeed , all here -- almost a century
to moon _RARE_
pulled away from the _RARE_ old volumes and walked around to the newer ones
volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling
was a metal ladder on _RARE_ attached to the top shelf
it over , climbed up , and lifted out the big volume , almost losing his balance from the weight of it
over and dropped it on the table
Calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring , he started to _RARE_ through several months
to turn right to the society page in each one , but interesting stories kept _RARE_ up to _RARE_ him
he found it in the paper of April 2
him little more than Mrs. Calhoun had remembered , stating that it had been a small , modest wedding compared to some of the others
a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and _RARE_
life was an open book , so to speak , from his birth in Jackson , _RARE_ , through his _RARE_ days at _RARE_ and his _RARE_ of a _RARE_ degree , which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
line on the bride said she was Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_
of New _RARE_
beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr. Black
Black was who he thought she was , Mr. Black's _RARE_ selling days might well be over
their _RARE_ from Gulf _RARE_
the search took twice as long , cutting down on his extra reading , for he had to pick through several columns of _RARE_ and _RARE_ social notes in each issue
it in the edition of May 15
said Mr. and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson , his home town -- so the lovely _RARE_ had been with him a year ago
his program was a call to the Jackson office of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to find out if _RARE_ Black was still with them -- or , more specifically , still with us
at his watch , saw it was only seven , and decided to _RARE_ his weakness now
next hour he scrambled _RARE_ up and down the ladder , sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ fire in Chicago , and the _RARE_ trial
middle of the stock market crash , he heard a slight noise in the outer office
around , saw nothing , and decided it must be a mouse
_RARE_ him , yet there was no sound , only _RARE_ silence
knew it was not sound , but lack of it
_RARE_ was no longer running
up and turned around to see the metal door closing
shut as he sprang toward it
his face against the _RARE_
there ''
shining through the _RARE_ dimly _RARE_ the office beyond -- enough for him to see there was no one there
heard the outer door closing
, come back '' , he shouted
it must be some damn _RARE_ or cleaning woman _RARE_ around , _RARE_ that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up
faint _RARE_ of fear _RARE_ in his mind
was _RARE_ , the person who'd just left couldn't have missed seeing Hank through the open door of the _RARE_ lighted room
if he'd somehow missed seeing him , he wouldn't have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room
was had meant to shut him up in here , had followed him and waited till the _RARE_ and square were deserted

his room at the motel
back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left
they could kill him just as easy right now
hear what was going on in this underground _RARE_
heard it and smelled it -- the steady _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , familiar _RARE_ of gas _RARE_
be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the _RARE_ office
, _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ had been like an _RARE_ which he could _RARE_ at his own pace and _RARE_
those minutes in her room , he had lost touch with her as a reality
and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ had _RARE_ him into thinking of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , separately or together , as a _RARE_
_RARE_ apart and _RARE_ again in his mind like some minute form of life on a _RARE_ slide
'' -- said Mr. Skyros
take a little time to think it over ''
awkward : very awkward
be all the _RARE_ of _RARE_ someone else to take over
_RARE_
would hear about it
knew -- `` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros
too much time , because I'll be _RARE_ some more myself pretty much right away
done favors for you , big favor not so long back , didn't I , and I'm right here to take on where Pretty left off

want no trouble , you don't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros ''
, no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in
his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; ; the _RARE_ smile seemed painted on his face
-- _RARE_ of dangerous information
too much entirely already
had Mr. Skyros at bay `` Big favor I done you
this deal o' _RARE_ -- and _RARE_ -- _RARE_ _RARE_ fire , ain't it , maybe you've been _RARE_ _RARE_ over that
say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully
deal with the ace o' _RARE_
do with an ace o' _RARE_ , bad luck ''
_RARE_ -- a widow , that was what they called a widow , these _RARE_ _RARE_ remembered Mr. Skyros _RARE_
that Angie knew , too
got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand -- it seemed to be a general rule
by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank , all of it , because naturally -- brothers , living together -- and Angie -- Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on _RARE_ _RARE_ , almost _RARE_ _RARE_ face -- or indeed anything about _RARE_
was not a man who thought very much about moral principles ; ; he found money much more interesting ; ; but all the same he thought now , _RARE_ , of the way in which _RARE_ _RARE_ his living -- and paid for his own stuff -- and eyed the soft smile , and the _RARE_ dark eyes , and he felt a little ill
, my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the _RARE_ says , better an _RARE_ of prevention to a pound of cure
in business so long because I'm careful
, a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , isn't it ''
a long while '' , said Angie
tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it
over to Castro and get fixed up there
wait no two weeks ''
Skyros didn't like Angie , but what with _RARE_ and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come out -- And Angie such a valuable salesman , _RARE_ said -- All the _RARE_ and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys -- Why did everything have to happen at once
_RARE_ , `` Why , you ain't turning Angie down , are you , Mr. Skyros
, we all figured -- I guess _RARE_ figure -- Angie '' -- _RARE_ gave him an _RARE_ smile
Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said
O.K. , _RARE_ , _RARE_ O.K. _RARE_ it , Mr. Skyros ''
God , the name repeated over and over , anybody to hear -- Not being a fool , Mr. Skyros knew why
from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have _RARE_ with one who was _RARE_ an _RARE_ and actually held -- you could say -- the whip hand
because of _RARE_
Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause -- Of course , there was another factor
his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast
, Angie might not last long
broke out on Mr. _RARE_ forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking -- hoping -- planning -- perhaps -- Good God above , had not _RARE_ been enough
_RARE_ thin shoulder _RARE_
you don't want to go talking that way '' , he said
, sure , you're the one take over for Pretty , soon as I get the supply , get started up again , isn't it
need worry , _RARE_
you , I know how it is with you , my friend , I _RARE_ , and I'll make it a special point -- a special favor -- get in touch , and get some stuff just for you
know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I'll try my best , my friend
, you got to remember , we all got _RARE_ , like any business
, he won't be around a little while , he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the _RARE_
, you see that , isn't it ''
, that's your business , Mr. Skyros '' , said Angie , and his _RARE_ eyes moved past Mr. _RARE_ shoulder to gaze vaguely out the _RARE_ window
appreciate it , you do that

none of us want no trouble
a room over the _RARE_ Club on San _RARE_ , you just ask for me there , you want see me
I call you -- tonight
o'clock , I call and see if you got any
_RARE_ for me , Mr. Skyros -- and _RARE_ to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash ''
, now , I don't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros
you know , _RARE_ , Pretty , he always keeps it a _RARE_ cash basis , like they say '' -- `` Sure '' , said Angie
, Mr. Skyros
throw , that the deal

you the cash , say five hundred for ten _RARE_
how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again
deal , Mr. Skyros
_RARE_ have a look round for it ''
do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend
awkward for everybody , isn't it , we all got to put up with _RARE_ sometimes
do my best for you ''
out of there in a hurry , _RARE_ past another man in the door , _RARE_ his _RARE_
thing -- yes , very true , one must make do as one could , in some situations
all be straightened out later
much later , but when things had settled down a little
deal with the _RARE_ woman went through
of _RARE_
not a _RARE_ man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that , indeed
wished he had never got into the business , and still -- scarcely to be _RARE_ , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy money _RARE_ _RARE_ , who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now , rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change
not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks
marked the few who did thank you , you didn't get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself , seeing how _RARE_ _RARE_ she could act to the others , before they'd take _RARE_ , _RARE_ to call the manager
seldom they did : used to it , probably
who came into a cheap store like this
_RARE_ , I saw that first
Here , I'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I don't bother with it , see
of place She'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing _RARE_ behind
noon , and she'd never come back
to
a lot of money , enough
smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills _RARE_ nobody would suspect -- maybe couldn't get it until Monday account of that , the banks -- But that wasn't really long to wait
she'd waited so long already
say anything at all to the old woman
it all planned out , how she'd do
she didn't feel good on Sunday , couldn't go to church -- _RARE_ be a little argument , but she could be stubborn -- and when the old woman had gone , quick pack the things she'd need to take , all but the dress she'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker _RARE_ , for a _RARE_
Monday morning -- or it might have to be Tuesday -- get up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer
be going to get that for an hour or so after _RARE_ had left , go do the daily shopping
leave a note with it , either -- or maybe just something like , Don't worry about me , I'm going away to make a better life
life

as if she wanted much
mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft -- all she wanted was a chance , where she wasn't marked as what she was
Katharine Ross , and work in a _RARE_ shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have _RARE_ clothes , and learn _RARE_ manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with _RARE_ names , the ones went to the same church and -- _RARE_ place , different job , different people , she'd be all different too
she'd do her hair another way ; ; _RARE_ , and wear different kinds of clothes -- she'd be Katharine Ross , just what that sounded like
give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply
I can't count ''
up the amount in _RARE_ silence
listening to other voices , out of the future
those _RARE_ new , different people
_RARE_ awfully nice , and pretty too , I like Katharine -- Let's ask Katharine to go with us , she's always lots of fun -- Katharine -- Soon , very soon now sixteen _RARE_ didn't wake until nearly _RARE_
going to be another hot day ; ; already the thermometer stood close to _RARE_
still sound asleep ; ; he made fresh coffee and _RARE_ through all the desk _RARE_ for more cigarettes before thinking of her _RARE_ , and found a _RARE_ stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted _RARE_ of face powder
a note _RARE_ on the desk asking her to call him _RARE_ today , and drove home
got out fresh liver for _RARE_ , he paused to look at her crouched _RARE_ over her _RARE_
was just a trifle _RARE_ around the middle
to remember reading somewhere that _RARE_ had large _RARE_ , and suffered a _RARE_ vision of the apartment _RARE_ with a dozen _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
then ''
her severely
lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats , it's not the _RARE_ thing in the world to find good homes for _RARE_ -- and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away
suppose now that you've finally grown up , if a little late , you'd go on producing _RARE_ every six months or so
well , it's a pity to _RARE_ your _RARE_ figure -- which all those _RARE_ would do anyway -- but I think when you've raised these we'll just have the _RARE_ fix it so there won't be any more
if the _RARE_ would take one
no good looking at me like that '' , as she wound _RARE_ around his _RARE_
nose unexpectedly wrinkled up
to be in the hall
hear you quarrel about her
well , you can't really blame Lolotte
her _RARE_ to you ''
was talking of _RARE_ when she saw the black line of the open door ; ; Sarah remembered it clearly
on
got to get busy
taken to her bed , with the door locked
it an inch and _RARE_ out the keys for me to give you
-- She thrust a bundle of keys _RARE_ on a thick red cord into _RARE_ hand
that there's much use in _RARE_ up the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ now
coffee '' -- coffee
-- cold ''
looked quite capable of _RARE_ it down her throat
don't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly

I'll take it down with me as I go ''
up the cup and _RARE_ up her top _RARE_ as if about to take off with a racing start
door she turned back , her Roman nose looking very long now and _RARE_
forgot
Lucien have gone after them
like that book your _RARE_ friend wrote -- except there aren't any ice _RARE_ to cross and no _RARE_ ''
don't know Mrs. _RARE_
they do if they find them ''
can't do anything
, childish , running after them like that
Ben so
course the _RARE_ won't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that _RARE_ _RARE_ outfit they say is running around , God knows where ''
_RARE_ away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , _RARE_ out the coffee , so no one would drink it
the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but _RARE_ -- especially that cup
deeply , _RARE_ sure that Lucien had filled it with opium
_RARE_ with Lucien , she had _RARE_ his demands for money -- and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage contract , Lucien would _RARE_ _RARE_ not only the immediate sum of gold under the _RARE_ in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father's entire estate
cold and hot , sticky and _RARE_ at the same time
a minute , she told herself , think about it ; ; Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee
lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New _RARE_
had taken it during her first day at _RARE_
she had missed it after her talk with _RARE_ , after dinner , just before _RARE_ was shot
Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes
else could have come in , too -- then or later while she was out of the room
have been easy to identify as opium by its odor
not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had _RARE_ _RARE_ opium and come back to _RARE_ with a formed plan to murder her
even know that she was there
certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the _RARE_ -- yes , and _RARE_ fool he had every right to expect
he had been surprised , _RARE_ surprised , but surprised
else
, Rev had said , don't _RARE_ danger
crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open
begun to tell Lucien of _RARE_ , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a _RARE_ of _RARE_ in the hall
-- or anybody -- could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium
not reasonable either
had disappeared before _RARE_ death and _RARE_ shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen _RARE_ own _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and questions
to doubt whether there had been in fact a _RARE_ dose of opium in the cup
somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave _RARE_
a certain amount of logic
the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste

merely an attempt to frighten her
go back to New York as Maude suggested ; ; she wouldn't run like a scared cat
well , she'd be very careful
and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life
she left her room she dug into her big _RARE_ bag , took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken
else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died
known all along
need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find out
_RARE_ have wished to make sure ; ; Rev loved _RARE_ , it was like a part of his breath and body ; ; Rev had stressed the need for money
never have tried to give her _RARE_
the envelope back in the bag ; ; there was no point in _RARE_ it up in the _RARE_ now , it was like _RARE_ the barn after the horse was stolen
all _RARE_ , by now , there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract
no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been
downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora _RARE_ into the dining room in her _RARE_ _RARE_ , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she hadn't
much work this morning , Miss Sarah -- everybody gone like that '' -- Sarah swallowed past another kind of _RARE_ in her throat
, then who brought it ''
Maude
to the kitchen and say she take it up to you ''
down a _RARE_ of _RARE_ rice
much breakfast this morning
know what we're going to do , Miss Sarah ''
got to eat '' , Sarah said , _RARE_ , because a chill crawled over her again

away
wasn't _RARE_ with opium , indeed it had no taste at all , not a grain of salt
what she could and went out along the covered _RARE_ , with the rain _RARE_ from the _RARE_
kitchen Glendora was _RARE_ picking chickens
a basket '' , Sarah told her
go to the _RARE_ ''
a chicken and a _RARE_ of feathers , and went with her through the _RARE_ , to the _RARE_
the right key and unlocked the door
a long , low room , like a root cellar , for it was _RARE_ up with soil , and _RARE_ had run _RARE_ over that , too
dark but dry and cool
out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried _RARE_ , eggs , _RARE_ , a little salt
looked _RARE_ than when Miss _RARE_ had shown her the _RARE_ , and since the men from the _RARE_ had called ; ; there were certainly now _RARE_ mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with
Glendora to the _RARE_ , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of _RARE_ and sides of bacon , hanging from the _RARE_ _RARE_
go hungry , not yet
fields were green and growing
you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here ''
said

Glendora back to the house , her basket and her apron _RARE_
for a moment , rain _RARE_ from the trees over her head , thinking of Maude
the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from _RARE_ room
the cool _RARE_ to do whatever she made up her mind to do
see how her death could affect Maude
see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her
there was something _RARE_ and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her
neither _RARE_ nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish
had suggested that Sarah return to New York
have shot _RARE_ -- if she'd had a reason to kill him
no use in standing there in the _RARE_ , trying to find a link between _RARE_ murder and opium in a cup of coffee
back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder
George and Lolotte were _RARE_ shoes
lamp stood on the table that _RARE_ , _RARE_ day
all three bent over a _RARE_ riding boot ; ; George had a _RARE_ hammer
a patch of leather , Rev _RARE_ something , a tiny _RARE_ , waiting for _RARE_ poised hammer
, `` First thing I do when I get to _RARE_ again , is get me a _RARE_ '' -- `` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly
up and saw her
up and stiffened
look up at all
no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at _RARE_ appearance , _RARE_ her to be _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and just possibly dead
, `` Come in , Sarah
know the news ''
news , Sarah thought as _RARE_ as Maude might have said it
was suddenly a little fixed and questioning
to George and Lolotte
your _RARE_ shop somewhere else
to talk to Sarah ''
the office , the spreading circle of _RARE_ , the patch of leather in _RARE_ hands
with the _RARE_ hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder
of panic caught Sarah


I've got to -- to see to the kitchen
-- Her words _RARE_ together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in _RARE_ face
did I do that
as warm , _RARE_ rain touched her face
no _RARE_ , _RARE_ to bear _RARE_
reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; ; if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien , her husband
be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love , but it was marriage
couldn't choose Rev as a _RARE_ ; ; it must be Lucien
that Lucien himself had not _RARE_ her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it
at the kitchen door , caught her breath , told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen , where Glendora was _RARE_ the chickens _RARE_ and Maude was cleaning lamp _RARE_
a _RARE_
Sarah , I can't cut up no chicken
say she won't ''
homely , everyday details of daily living _RARE_ a vicious attempt to frighten her -- or to murder her
everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate _RARE_
what had happened or hadn't happened , somebody had to see about dinner
the chickens with , if she had known it , something of _RARE_ _RARE_ look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs
since last night
think there was any reason to ''
there isn't
him again anyway
to some of the fellows he works with , friends , anyone
find out how happy he is with his wife , whether he plays around with women
try looking into his wife too
have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been having any trouble ''
think Black's the one we're looking for ''

he might be '' , Conrad said grimly
again he might not ''
a _RARE_ world '' , Rourke said
is _RARE_ best friend ''
know ''
you be coming back soon ''
think so
my way to see the _RARE_ woman ''
secretary

think Gilborn is the -- ''
don't think anything
don't want to go off _RARE_ before picking up Black , that's all ''

says he was in his office all day with her yesterday
to make sure
it's just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn ''

you later ''
you ever going to go home ''
sure as hell doesn't look like it , does it
you , if these _RARE_ ever knew the trouble they put us to , they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off ''
to tell that to the next corpse you meet ''
up and sat on the small _RARE_ bench , _RARE_ his right leg
at his watch
ten minutes before eleven
how long it would be before they had a signed confession from _RARE_ Black
experience let him know , even at this early stage , that Black was his man
still wanted to know why
a cold , _RARE_ day , the day after _RARE_ death , but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the _RARE_ October wind
Conrad , Gilborn had no destination
walked , not _RARE_ where he was , not caring
automatically at the street corners , waiting for the traffic lights to change , _RARE_ of other people , his coat open and _RARE_
walked , he tried to think


what Conrad had tried to make him believe
nothing _RARE_ about his thinking
a succession of _RARE_ passing through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession
of what Conrad had told him made it impossible for Gilborn to accept , with any degree of _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of it
had intellectual meaning for him only
they _RARE_ him not at all
was and your wife were intimate
_RARE_ exact words
sense and yet they didn't
Conrad had told him the truth
so
wasn't so
so because it couldn't be so
was alive -- and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm -- she had been the center of his life
the sun , he the _RARE_ planet _RARE_ around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed
years he had lived , _RARE_ towards a _RARE_ , eating , working , breathing without plan , without reason
come along to justify everything
his goal , she was his reason
lived all his life waiting for her
, in the time that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility , not once , not for one _RARE_ of a second , of her _RARE_
not consider it now

he walked , _RARE_ again
ended , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building
began to nod his head automatically , then remembered who Gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before
at Gilborn with _RARE_ curiosity
by him without seeing him
the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts
apartment itself , all was still
were no longer there
no evidence that anything was different than it had been
Kitti wasn't there
off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door
, sitting there , in the familiar _RARE_ , the truth began to sink in

no anger towards Kitti , no sense that she had betrayed him

all he had , everything he had , everything he wanted
taken her away from him

is a _RARE_ entry in the _RARE_ , there is a _RARE_ one , he remembered from his school days
is a _RARE_ , there is a killer

was and your wife were intimate
from the chair , took off his coat
he went into the bedroom
still showed signs of where Kitti had _RARE_
there for a long time
at the bed _RARE_
was empty now
lie in it no more
lie in it no more
whether Kitti had _RARE_ in that same bed with Who
minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there
end of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ his brains , thinking over and over again of Kitti , her friends , her past , he left the bedroom

think of no answer
on his coat again
, he took one last , _RARE_ look at the apartment
he would never see it again
street , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley Gilborn was a _RARE_ figure
_RARE_ , Kitti _RARE_ death had a quite different effect
, _RARE_ death was a source of guilty , but _RARE_ _RARE_ , happy hope
defense , it must be said she was unaware of the _RARE_ hope
had asked her , she would have described herself only as nervous and worried
on the _RARE_ paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter
whether Stanley would call
to be with him , to give him the comfort and _RARE_ she knew he needed
skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out

she was feeling sick , both from concern about Stanley and hunger
he called
she reflected , even men like Stanley , are _RARE_
to think of his _RARE_ actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't so many after all
was quite _RARE_
one of the things she liked about Stanley
like so many other men
last night , for instance
the movies had been fine
taken her upstairs to say good night
invited him in for coffee
in the kitchen , as she was watching the _RARE_ , waiting for the water to _RARE_ , that he had grabbed for her
, without giving her a chance to prepare for it
, he had put his arms on her shoulders , turned her around , and pressed her to him , so close she couldn't _RARE_
she _RARE_ for the long scratch across his face , tried to explain she couldn't help herself , that the panic arose in her _RARE_
hadn't understood
left , she knew she would never see him again
like that
always _RARE_ what Stanley was going to do , ever since she first met him
that one morning
he walked in to announce to her , _RARE_ , that he was married
she was going to die
assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him
remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion
it was _RARE_ during the second week she worked for Stanley
nothing that he said or did , but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him , looking forward to his eventual proposal
_RARE_ years old then
was already considerably concerned over her _RARE_ future
had been able to maintain a _RARE_ and assured _RARE_ in the face of her _RARE_ mother's continued _RARE_ , had been able to resist her _RARE_ to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of _RARE_
, it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose
to be expected that Stanley would be shy , slow in taking such a _RARE_ step
along in life , she knew , convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman
result , he never looked for it
day , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; ; a woman who was willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband
there was a woman who , _RARE_ , had already given him love
Blanche loved Stanley
, unexpectedly , Stanley made his _RARE_
first day , Blanche literally thought she was going to die , or , at the very least , go out of her mind
have been easier for her if Kitti Walker hadn't been everything that Blanche was not
thirty years younger than Stanley , taller than Stanley , _RARE_ than Stanley had any right to hope for , much less expect
have married a score of men
no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley Gilborn , there was no need for her to marry Stanley
come into the office , on _RARE_ recommendation , because she needed help in preparing her income tax return
filled out the return and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely asked Kitti to join him , never expecting her to accept
all this because the door to _RARE_ office was open and , without straining too hard , she could hear everything that was said
gone out , saying he would be back in an hour
come back for over two
day , Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened
mornings when Stanley came in late , afternoons when he left early , days when he didn't come in at all
something must be causing _RARE_ new , strange behavior but she never once connected it with Kitti Walker
too _RARE_
six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office , Stanley announced he and Kitti were married
Blanche managed to cover the _RARE_ surprise and offer her _RARE_
the two of them left for a _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_
were away Blanche came into the office every morning , running things as she had always run them for Stanley , going through the week in a _RARE_ _RARE_ , getting things done automatically , out of habit
one week , she was able to continue in this manner
morning of _RARE_ return , however , her strength left her
of watching his _RARE_ happy face , listening to his soft humming as he bent over his _RARE_ figures , and Blanche had to leave
away for ten days
days were like no others that Blanche had known
she stayed in bed
tell anyone , even her mother , what was wrong
to have a doctor , _RARE_ there was nothing a doctor could do for her
'' , said the fingerprint man
, if you're going to believe those _RARE_ , you'll have to look for a killer who's a _RARE_ piano player ''
by playing an imaginary piano , doing a _RARE_ passage with a _RARE_ exaggerated attack
it _RARE_ he shifted to acting out , but with no change of manner , the killing of Rose _RARE_
snatched at an imaginary _RARE_ , _RARE_ down hard to _RARE_ it and coming away with equal snap like a ball that's been bounced hard
same way he _RARE_ _RARE_ a _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ off that , pressing his hands against the floor and _RARE_ _RARE_ off that
moving like a ballet _RARE_ , playing for _RARE_
_RARE_ killer acted this way , _RARE_ up with him was going to be a _RARE_
him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear _RARE_ in his hair
Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not _RARE_ so _RARE_ up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment , we might have had less trouble _RARE_ Felix of our _RARE_
you will remember , was still New _RARE_ Day
time Felix turned up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children and a few _RARE_ _RARE_ who had not yet _RARE_ up , it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's _RARE_ and paper hats
the exception
retained his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be going , he was ready to join it
_RARE_ , might give you some idea of what Felix was like
, he hadn't happened upon us in that _RARE_ hall without warning
boys had finished their _RARE_ examination and the body had been removed for _RARE_
wagon , therefore , was not out in front of the house any more , but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any _RARE_ and _RARE_
, _RARE_ , the crowd of curious _RARE_ gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance
yourself in _RARE_ place for a moment
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , landlord
away from home for the New _RARE_ _RARE_ , but now the party is over and you come home
in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol _RARE_ and not yet eliminated from the system , you are sober
have your paper hat and you're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in addition to anything else you may be , you are also the _RARE_ who created that most peculiar _RARE_ out in the back yard
too much to assume that you will have a more _RARE_ interest in paper hats than will Mr. _RARE_ _RARE_
your paper horn clutched in your big , _RARE_ fist , and for your entrance you have planned a _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ to your friends and tenants
your house a focus of public and police attention
imagine yourself _RARE_ under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so _RARE_ _RARE_ and armed with a paper horn
could be startled into _RARE_
your way through the cluster of the curious and you _RARE_ up to the cop on the door
yourself and ask him what's going on
answering you , he sticks his head in the door and _RARE_ up the stairs
the upstairs guy '' , he _RARE_
owner
send him up ''
turns back to you
on in '' , he says
tell you what's cooking ''
, as you go into the house _RARE_ by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this _RARE_ , official control , could you go on _RARE_ that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand
getting at is that we were fully prepared for _RARE_ being an odd one
his _RARE_ out in the back yard , and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a little special
not , however , prepared for anything like the _RARE_ that confronted us as Felix came up the stairs
of course , must have been equally _RARE_ for what confronted him , but , _RARE_ , I did find his reaction startling
was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he'd forgotten about them , he now remembered
_RARE_ up the stairs and joined the dance
the hat , lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a _RARE_ , and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to _RARE_ with him
stopped dead and _RARE_ at Felix
his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the _RARE_ of even that solidly built old house
a _RARE_ of a man
_RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_
was _RARE_ and heavy and _RARE_ , and when he laughed he showed his teeth , which were big and white and strong and _RARE_ _RARE_
remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so _RARE_ not _RARE_
had _RARE_ most of the way to the back of his neck
only a _RARE_ of hair and he wore it _RARE_ short
almost as white as his teeth
man of his mass he was curiously short
a _RARE_ but he was a bit of a _RARE_ figure
with so big and so _RARE_ developed a _RARE_ and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five
it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement
was just this side of being a _RARE_
till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him
dressed in a manner _RARE_ might suggest for the _RARE_ man's country weekend
sports jacket , _RARE_ gray slacks , pink _RARE_ shirt , black silk _RARE_
were clear
_RARE_ shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed _RARE_ some _RARE_ of it on the massive _RARE_ of his laughter
a _RARE_
_RARE_
''

'' , he said _RARE_
, the happy one ''
much Latin we remember '' , Gibby said _RARE_
always live up to your name , always like this , always making happy ''
try '' , Felix said _RARE_
world is full of _RARE_ who put their hearts into making the _RARE_ scene
noticed that it _RARE_ things any ''
for you '' , Gibby said
the rest of your name ''
rest of it
all there is ''
there ever was ''
past I leave to _RARE_ '' , Felix _RARE_ , _RARE_ that he could be _RARE_ as well as happy
live in the present ''
the present '' , Felix proclaimed
the future
any other time in which a man can live ''
'' , Gibby announced , `` are not _RARE_
_RARE_ District _RARE_
is a police officer
a fingerprint _RARE_
future , your immediate future , be made to include taking us upstairs , giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work , and making available to him your finger tips ''
one could never have looked _RARE_
more than joy
_RARE_
lovely _RARE_ '' , he _RARE_
_RARE_ , so beautiful
along
_RARE_ ''
_RARE_ along the hall , heading for the next flight of stairs
him back
here because of what happened last night '' , he said
, yes , but important
is important , for the record let's have the full name ''
important ''

important ''
'' , Felix whispered
_RARE_ ''
, not bothering to whisper
'' , Felix _RARE_
can't see what would make it necessary for you to know
make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world ''
lowered his voice
_RARE_ ''


but not for years
it's been just Felix
I did after my _RARE_ birthday was go into court and have it officially changed , and this is something I don't tell everybody
almost forty years ago ''
that he was a man of about sixty , he bounded up the stairs and with each _RARE_ rendered the number less _RARE_
a _RARE_ of a boy , our Felix , and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in _RARE_ how _RARE_ he was and how full of juice and spirit
him up the stairs
would gather up _RARE_ and the _RARE_ on the third floor and bring us those of them who would _RARE_ submit to _RARE_
think we didn't need _RARE_ and Jean , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no _RARE_ that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were through with this case
if we had _RARE_ the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood
, if in our present group , would certainly be interested in knowing that much , and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way
can possibly avoid it , you don't hand out any extra chances
us into his studio
that _RARE_ _RARE_ space at the very top of the house , where ceiling _RARE_ had to _RARE_ themselves to the varying angles of roof slope
angle of its pitch a big _RARE_ had been fitted into the roof and all these _RARE_ were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades
first opened the door on it , all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night
fixed that , rolling back the shades on some of the _RARE_ and adjusting screens on the others
about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience
his movements was tentative
no process of trial and error
the room completely _RARE_ out , as it was when we came in , he _RARE_ fixed things so that the whole place was _RARE_ in the maximum of light without at any point _RARE_ even so much as a crack of glare
_RARE_ _RARE_ , I was surprised by what we found
no display of either works in progress or of finished work
there on work table or _RARE_ stood a shape with a sheet or a _RARE_ _RARE_ over it
might have been mad , but there was no telling
all completely _RARE_
was solid and heavy and in good condition
orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the _RARE_ comfort , convenience and efficiency
tools about but they were neatly kept
no confusion and no _RARE_
sheet metal were neatly stacked in _RARE_
not see the newspapers the next day
his staff -- he suspected it was Ed Thornburg -- _RARE_ them and for this Andy was grateful
fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping _RARE_ , a _RARE_ he rarely used , and didn't _RARE_ until early afternoon
him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling _RARE_ his stomach
window _RARE_ a beautiful summer day
same sun was shining upon little _RARE_ also , and those who had _RARE_ him

still a very big world , despite all the modern _RARE_ to the contrary
sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door
_RARE_ , perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten
to _RARE_ at _RARE_ entrance
, Mr. Paxton

people waiting to see you , though ''
''
own people
the show tonight ''
up the telephone
I let them know you're awake ''
suppose
, do you know ''

better
plenty of guts , Mr. Paxton
me to call her ''
expecting me to ''
his head so Andy told him not to bother
reason for _RARE_ _RARE_ was to comfort or to be _RARE_
not manage the former or expect the latter ; ; they had nothing to give to each other
might look peculiar to _RARE_ , but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of _RARE_
little time to himself , anyway
afternoon sped toward evening , the suite saw a steady _RARE_ of Paxton _RARE_ pass in and out , each with his own special problem
with the writers
spent the morning _RARE_ the act , _RARE_ all the gay songs , _RARE_ and dancing with a view of the best public relations
_RARE_ the original _RARE_ but it was at least _RARE_ , as _RARE_ the _RARE_ circumstances
reported that the orchestra had hastily _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' in case it was needed
was back and forth on several occasions , first to _RARE_ with Andy on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ engagement -- they decided it was wise -- and later to announce that a prominent _RARE_ , also an agency _RARE_ , had agreed to fill the _RARE_ open date
Bake slipped in , pale and drawn , last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it
if there was anything he could do
a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ last minute arrangements
_RARE_ Vecchio , they heard nothing
it was time to _RARE_
_RARE_ about , spotted reporters in the lobby , so Andy was _RARE_ away quietly through the _RARE_ service entrance in a strange car which Hub had _RARE_ somewhere
in _RARE_ the curious at the hotel , but there was no chance of avoiding them at the _RARE_
was surrounded by a _RARE_
the parking lot , making progress by automobile difficult
he reached the protection of the stage door , Andy was recognized
his arrival spread through the crowd like a _RARE_
around him , fingers pointing , eyes _RARE_
not a _RARE_ gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night's _RARE_
come not to _RARE_ but to observe
worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy
_RARE_ in every table he could find
heading of it's an ill wind , et _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ by contrast
kept their distance , _RARE_ by the _RARE_
his dressing room was a large _RARE_ and a card that read , `` We're with you all the way ''
signed by everyone in the _RARE_
help but be touched
_RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ a note of thanks to be _RARE_ on the call board
waiting to report that Lou _RARE_ had been _RARE_ up to the point where he could function efficiently
that this had been no small _RARE_
looked better ; ; any kind of job was better than brooding
him , `` Bake , I wish you'd talk to _RARE_ , see if some kind of p. _RARE_ system can be _RARE_ up outside
barely possible with this crowd that the _RARE_ wasn't able to get a table
want him to miss the message ''
try
going to like it much , though , giving away what he should be selling ''
the only one who didn't care for _RARE_ scheme
time later , Lieutenant Bonner _RARE_ into the dressing room
got a bone to pick with you , Mr. Paxton
damn _RARE_ ''
up the revised _RARE_ he had been studying
about them ''
going to _RARE_ me up good
have been here all afternoon , setting up for this thing ''
that , with the _RARE_ cooperation , the police had occupied _RARE_ _RARE_ like a _RARE_
_RARE_ had been installed to film the audience , the _RARE_ list was being checked out name by name , and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot _RARE_ automobiles for a possible lead
it was virtually impossible to screen the _RARE_ outside , even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose
want you to have the _RARE_ taken out ''

like we're never going to see eye to eye , Lieutenant
tell you what I wanted the p. _RARE_ system for ''
, I know
such a long shot '' -- `` No longer than yours
you expect to get tonight , anyway
somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces
a sign on his car that says , ' Here _RARE_ the Paxton _RARE_ ' ''
the _RARE_ in his fist
can't stop you from doing what you think is right
try to stop me , either ''
'' , Bonner said , `` you're going to ask us for help
hardly wait ''
you don't understand is that I'm asking for it now ''
_RARE_ , still full of ill will
gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination ; ; he had to _RARE_ to routine , tested procedures
otherwise would be to admit his _RARE_
admit or not , Bonner was helpless
showed too much planning , the _RARE_ appeared too _RARE_ to be caught by a _RARE_
was scheduled for eleven o'clock
for a _RARE_ longer , hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the _RARE_ money
_RARE_ _RARE_ , on separate _RARE_ , could not reach him at any _RARE_ location in Los Angeles , nor could they secure any _RARE_ information regarding his efforts

_RARE_ _RARE_ probably halfway to _RARE_ with our money by now ''
one smiled , he felt _RARE_ to add , `` Just kidding , _RARE_ ''
in to _RARE_ , `` Andy , _RARE_ sending up smoke signals
ready ''
he _RARE_ about ''

drinking , aren't they ''

a bunch of _RARE_ out there tonight
nobody wants to pass out and miss anything ''
in a lower voice but Andy _RARE_ , `` They act more like a jury than an audience ''
, `` Well , I guess we can't wait any longer
you stick by the stage door
shows up during the number -- or you hear anything -- give me the signal ''
said , `` I'll stay on the phone , Mr. Paxton
couple of _RARE_ I can work on ''
a _RARE_ -- but leave one line open
try to phone us ''
into the corridor , their `` good _RARE_ ''

what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different , as if he really needed it
right
, cut to _RARE_ and hastily _RARE_ together during the afternoon , had not been _RARE_ sufficiently by anyone
had nothing of the _RARE_ , pace or _RARE_ of the previous night
luck would normally step in
was no ordinary show and Andy knew it
_RARE_ well or badly had nothing to do with it
had come not to be _RARE_ but to judge
had changed him from a _RARE_ to a _RARE_
framework , what followed was strained , even _RARE_
_RARE_ and the _RARE_ numbers left little but _RARE_ and other songs of equal _RARE_
was as _RARE_ as a _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ ahead , _RARE_ the _RARE_ words as if they possessed real meaning , and gradually his listeners warmed to him
grew more _RARE_ ; ; the evening was still not beyond _RARE_ , not as a show but for him as a person
was yet to come
reached the _RARE_ of his act , a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ drew his attention to the wings
-- a _RARE_ , _RARE_ Vecchio -- was standing there , _RARE_ by two men in the uniforms of _RARE_ transport guards
_RARE_ and pointing at the large suitcase he held
his heart _RARE_ heavily with relief
at _RARE_ to cut off the _RARE_ introduction
died away _RARE_
a deep breath
and gentlemen , in place of my regular closing number tonight , I'd like to sing something of a different nature for you
if you please -- the ' _RARE_ _RARE_ ' ''
rather than heard the _RARE_ that swept across the audience
he blame them
song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste , _RARE_ _RARE_ beyond the _RARE_ of _RARE_
choice , he plunged into it , anyway , holding onto the _RARE_ for support
and _RARE_
voice shook
first time in his life he forgot the _RARE_ _RARE_ through and had to cover up by humming the rest
if the audience would let him finish
; ; though _RARE_ , they were still _RARE_
he was finally through , their _RARE_ was made apparent
_RARE_ then quickly stopped
the silence was complete
lights came up , Andy could see that a number of _RARE_ were already on their way toward the exit
_RARE_
God '' , he muttered
God ''
there to support him
okay , Mr. Paxton
here , all of it ''
moment , all he could think of was what he'd been forced to _RARE_
you hear them
know what they think of me ''
of damn _RARE_ '' , Hub _RARE_
needs them ''
his arm
, Andy , it'll be all right
that can't be _RARE_ ''
were hollow
, better than any of them , that a public image was as _RARE_ as _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ horses and all the _RARE_ men Vecchio _RARE_ in
got it , Andy
how , but I got it
believe the places I've been today
had to sign your life away , you'll probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go for , but '' -- Andy nodded _RARE_
doesn't matter , Rock
our part ''
that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room
_RARE_ crowd was _RARE_ absent ; ; the place had the air of a _RARE_
no desire to _RARE_ himself but Hub reported that the _RARE_ outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to _RARE_ them
watched until he got as far as the hall , almost out of sight , then hurried after

wait ''
up with the old man in the living room
Arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door
this one favor , Dad
tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours ''
not ''
man gave the room a stare in leaving ; ; under the _RARE_ _RARE_ the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory
the truth ''
_RARE_ girl was killed by Mr. _RARE_ son
Ferguson have been across the street , talking to the kid
some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime
you accept facts
kids were together a lot , they were having some kind of _RARE_ affair -- God knows how far that had gone -- and the kid's _RARE_
, and the man who hit you and took the cane , he _RARE_
, how much more do you want ''
looked him over closely
sound like an old woman
have gone to work today , _RARE_ of _RARE_ around _RARE_ on the _RARE_ house ''
, see here '' -- `` The trouble with you '' , old man Arthur began , and then checked himself
Arthur had opened the _RARE_ and there was a _RARE_ odor of hot _RARE_
man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight
enough time to go into it '' , he finished , and slammed the door in his _RARE_ face
turned from the window _RARE_
found something else up there '' , she said _RARE_ to the empty room
took it away , _RARE_ or something ''
_RARE_ across the room , then back to the windows
they've gone , they didn't come back , and they didn't arrest that _RARE_ boy ''
frowning and _RARE_ her lip
wearing a brown cotton dress , cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look _RARE_ , a _RARE_ set into the skirt and _RARE_ _RARE_ below
the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows
on earth did I send him off to work
excuse enough to keep him home that young Mr. _RARE_ still over there ''
energy , she went to the phone and rang _RARE_ office and asked for him
think you had better come home ''
, we're so busy
been on _RARE_ neck , an order he expected didn't come through and he's '' -- `` I don't care
you here
alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous
someone to go out and find out what's happening ''
I couldn't do that , even if I were home ''
grew high and trembling
can't be _RARE_ every time those cops turn around
think I did something ''
see the grin that split her mouth ; ; the teeth that _RARE_ into the phone were like a _RARE_
just have to risk it
_RARE_ along in the dark , can you
that you even more than I would be wondering what they're up to
some clothes '' , she tossed in
''
she ignored the _RARE_
, that Mr. Ferguson was here
he wants to ask you some questions
him off
expect you until five ''
I'd better wait until five ''

right away ''
the receiver into its holder and stepped away
were bright with anticipation
office , Mr. Holden replaced the phone slowly
from his chair
to cough then ; ; he went to the window and _RARE_ there with the fresh breeze on his face
his hat out of the closet
moment he thought of going into _RARE_ office to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a _RARE_ in his head , that he decided to let it go
the _RARE_ in the outer office , muttering , `` I've got to go out for a little while ''
call _RARE_ if she wanted to , let _RARE_ raise the roof or even can him , he didn't care
into the car
key into the switch , pressing the _RARE_ with his foot , putting the car into reverse , seemed vast _RARE_ almost beyond the ability of his shaking body
in the street , the traffic was a _RARE_ _RARE_ in which he wandered _RARE_
turned into the highway that led to the _RARE_ of the city and then rose toward home , he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes , sucking in air and _RARE_ and _RARE_ his eyes to clear them of tears
earth was in _RARE_ mind , that she wanted him up there _RARE_ on what the cops were doing
she think he could do
to ignore what his own common sense told him , but it wasn't possible ; ; her motives were too _RARE_
him to get into trouble
the police to notice him , suspect him
going to keep on _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , suggesting , and _RARE_ until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions
knew in that moment , with a cold _RARE_ of despair , a dying of old hopes , that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors
, open ; ; but enough
some _RARE_ to repeat to the police
inner thoughts _RARE_ at it , he forced himself to think back , _RARE_ the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him _RARE_ the child
_RARE_ to anything
been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions
scene flashed before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young _RARE_ girl turning startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light
cops somehow got hold of that
it hadn't been what it seemed , he'd had no idea the girl was in there
touched her
he came to examine the scene , there was a certain _RARE_ to it , it had the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion darted into his mind
, of course
have plotted a thing like that
just that little _RARE_ played into her hands
murder
on the wheel , clutching it , staring into the sunlight , and tried to bring order into his thoughts
_RARE_ and sick
no use _RARE_ off into a territory of _RARE_ nightmare
his wife
married to him for better or for worse
be _RARE_ planning his destruction
was

the conviction of truth roared through him , _RARE_ his last hope of safety , he was reaching to release the hand _RARE_ , to head up the road for home , doing her bidding
, and the road _RARE_ , familiar scenes crept past on either side
to a stretch of old orange _RARE_ , the trees dead , some of them _RARE_ , and then there was an _RARE_ shopping area , and tract houses
the feeling that he should _RARE_ the car and run off somewhere to hide
couldn't imagine where
really no place to go , finally , except home to Mae
gate he slowed , looking around
beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there _RARE_ ; ; he didn't even look up
on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur ; ; he was straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be waiting to report something
on the gas
idea _RARE_ in from nowhere
go to the police
tell them his fears of being involved , he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how Mae had _RARE_ and how she had held it over him -- the scene was complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and _RARE_ silent patience
throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department
what Mae would want him to do , though
sure of this
had _RARE_ himself to the very worst , once he had _RARE_ all the _RARE_ of worry and suspense , there wouldn't be very much for Mae to do
moment , Holden almost slammed on the _RARE_ to go back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about
be such a relief
that old sign , supposed to be painted over a door somewhere , _RARE_ hope , all _RARE_ who enter here
Holden said to himself , surprised at his own sudden _RARE_ , I'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be
, they've _RARE_ awake nights , they've shook at the slightest _RARE_ , they've _RARE_ their own destruction , and now it's all over and they can give up
they're giving up hope
hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension

a hand at the empty street
see you go
into the _RARE_ space before the garage and got out , _RARE_ the car door
up and down the street
car had been in sight , Holden would have walked directly to it
to the front door and opened it and looked in
the room from the hallway to the kitchen
a cup of something _RARE_ , coffee perhaps , in one hand , a fresh piece of toast in the other
there , watching Holden come in , and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge _RARE_ of her white teeth
'' -- `` I've been thinking '' , she said , _RARE_ the toast
you have an old pair of painting _RARE_ in the garage
them that time you painted the porch at our other house
you wiped up some _RARE_ ''
caught him off guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of _RARE_

minute
you '' -- `` I've been looking for them , and they're gone
they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago
yesterday
to paint in them , and then you just took them for _RARE_
have them now ''
don't remember any _RARE_ at all ''
were all faded
at the knees ''
_RARE_ and _RARE_ and watching
paint , wasn't it
I'm not sure of the color
had them ''
, sit down
the cup of coffee
what this is all about ''
her head
another _RARE_ of toast
almost absently how she _RARE_ , how the whole side of her cheek moved , a slab of fat that extended down into her neck
goodness , you ought to remember if I do
to have to go to the police and explain what happened
the truth or something before they come here ''
_RARE_ entered _RARE_ being ; ; his nerves seemed _RARE_ down to the tips of his _RARE_ fingers and his _RARE_ felt stiff and _RARE_ , _RARE_ to break like an _RARE_ at any moment
never owned any painting _RARE_
with a _RARE_ pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs. _RARE_
the eyebrows more like this ''
had finished with that , he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else , most probably a _RARE_
to look like him now , would you say
the mouth , _RARE_
this , maybe ''
dust on objects in a room on the _RARE_ floor of the Hotel Dumont and blew it off again , and did the same in a tiny , almost _RARE_ room in a _RARE_ in the West _RARE_
also used vacuum _RARE_ in both rooms , sucking dust up once more
the Third _RARE_ District , _RARE_ _RARE_ , had the _RARE_ , the most _RARE_ , job
Hotel Dumont there had , at the time in issue , been twenty-three _RARE_ , counting couples as singular
, as one , Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne , who had checked in a little after noon the day before , and had not checked out together
Willings was not included ; ; he had been at the Dumont for almost a week
, of course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only _RARE_ at the hotel
( or _RARE_ with the _RARE_ themselves omitted ) provided merely a place to start , and their identification was the _RARE_ of starts
and addresses listed , _RARE_ came next
take time ; ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble some water
I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been
Boston
he's in '' -- ) The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems
Arthur offered respectable and convenient _RARE_ to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want -- heaven knew didn't want
_RARE_ anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller stations to distant homes , probably through rain or , in November , something worse
Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont
Arthur had _RARE_ _RARE_ , again counting rooms rather than people
_RARE_ out
find what was wanted , as was most likely , check out other guests , with special -- but not exclusive -- attention to those with rooms on the street
active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be
know , while all this went on , that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel
not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel
other _RARE_ , less convenient but not impossible
dull business , _RARE_ , and hard on feet
also the one _RARE_ question to ask , and ask widely : Did you notice anything out of the way
for example , a man carrying a _RARE_ rifle , probably with a _RARE_ sight attached
, of course , no hope it really would be that simple
, whether _RARE_ marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walked to his _RARE_ point with rifle over shoulder , _RARE_ a marching tune
anything that might hide a rifle
suitcase
fat suitcase , for that matter
that , from room _RARE_ , from _RARE_

, it appeared , long enough to _RARE_ attention
say , for musical instruments
at the Dumont
the King Arthur
was _RARE_ there
been for a week

all
that
Pearson , _RARE_ _RARE_ , thought for a time he might be on to something
_RARE_ at the Dumont turned up a _RARE_ box -- a very long box for very _RARE_ flowers
oil on green tissue
to check
: sorry

at all strange
a man had tried , at the King Arthur , to register with an _RARE_
Dumont , a guest had come in a _RARE_ wheel chair
King Arthur one guest had had his head heavily _RARE_ , and another had a _RARE_ foot and had walked with _RARE_
also been a man who must have had St. _RARE_ or something , because he kept _RARE_ his head
_RARE_ in , William _RARE_ tossed them into the _RARE_ which had become his head
in
no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at her house on _RARE_ Road , _RARE_ , _RARE_
was modern , large , on five acres
cost plenty
cops would check from time to time ; ; pass word when there was word to pass
this news into the _RARE_
out , damn it
the next move
forget motive for the moment

actually with Payne when he was shot , or who had left the party within not more than five minutes ( make five arbitrary ) _RARE_ had none
; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ publicity director ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ of _RARE_
been with Payne when he was shot , could not therefore have shot him from above
Willings
left after the _RARE_ ; ; had been seen to leave
have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his _RARE_
seriously , therefore
, then -- _RARE_ which felt like facts
ambush , certainly ; ; Willings undoubtedly had
, presumably , a better than average shot
hunch , now -- Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four
if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , _RARE_ , than anything else that went on two legs
laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a _RARE_
had had to `` go on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone on
checked out further

motive is a part of fact
his right mind _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_
do not keep that well in a _RARE_ mind
had accomplished much in a quarter of a century
now to correct so old a wrong
his head
he thought , I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a _RARE_

left the party early , pleading a _RARE_
of opportunity , _RARE_ she had a gun
, _RARE_ , have brought one in in a _RARE_ suitcase
on the Payne luggage
might now have taken it away again
her husband _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_
it happened and hell knew it too
it happened , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young
it _RARE_ young ; ; call it _RARE_
was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was primitive
not move in primitive circles
young , but not that young
to Bill _RARE_ that he was , on a hunch basis , _RARE_ a good many
himself that all _RARE_ were tentative
reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities
, mother or son , or mother and son
obvious

too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years
had more cause to remain , even increasingly to _RARE_
boy , particularly
had , apparently -- if Mrs. _RARE_ was right in what she had told Mullins -- only in recent months been forced to give up college , to work as a _RARE_
man he _RARE_ for this made much of -- youth and bitterness and -- Bill picked up the telephone ; ; got Mullins
out a pickup on Mrs. _RARE_ and the boy when you've got enough to go on '' , Bill said

say , of course , that he had not really had any such wish ; ; that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say , lightly , meaning nothing
would turn out to be true ; ; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say
named _RARE_ _RARE_ , with `` _RARE_ '' and `` _RARE_ '' but pronounced without them , had been fired at _RARE_ insistence
also , if Pam North was right , a closer _RARE_ of Lauren _RARE_ than she , now , was inclined to admit
deny the latter ; ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder
have to be given the opportunity

evident that Mullins was the man to go
evident that a captain should remain at his desk , _RARE_ with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat
was good and tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster
keep the firm seat ; ; let _RARE_
cats are _RARE_ it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins
_RARE_ , on _RARE_ bed , appeared to be one cat -- rather large , as _RARE_ cats go , and , to be sure , having two heads and two _RARE_
other hand , they , or it , seemed to have no legs whatever
said , `` _RARE_ '' , to her cats , and added that proper cats met their _RARE_ at the door
dark brown ears , one _RARE_ slightly at this
right '' , Pam said
know it isn't _RARE_ ''
this the one _RARE_ cat suddenly became two cats , stretching
the more _RARE_ , began at once to talk , her voice _RARE_
a more direct cat , leaped from the bed and _RARE_ _RARE_ toward the kitchen
surprised , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ after her
it isn't _RARE_ , two waving _RARE_ told Pam North
not , whatever tale was told by _RARE_
would _RARE_
be firm
most unlikely that she would be firm
to be fat cats , Pam thought , and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a _RARE_ and considered pulling her thoughts together
time , it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble
feeling that Anthony Payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was , in any event , _RARE_
_RARE_ explanation of her confidence , so _RARE_ , been a little thin
more like a thought , but not a great deal more
tall dark boy , carrying _RARE_ too heavy for him , found what he might have considered _RARE_ of a man he probably hated more than he could bear
himself -- how
a rifle and killed
she had no answers ; ; had only a hope
kid -- the poor , frail kid
have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , is the size of it
, _RARE_ -- The telephone rang
, to her surprise , that she had been almost _RARE_
o'clock in the afternoon
for lunch -- that was the trouble
to remember

remember
-- `` Hello
this is she

had music in it
words coming too fast , they came on the music of the voice
said I would '' , Pam said
won't talk about who gave the information
they have to
, Mrs. _RARE_
they have '' -- She was interrupted
this a cry for help '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ said
a door _RARE_ unlocked '' , Madden _RARE_
damn door '' , said the police chief
gift horse to be viewed with suspicion ''
face wore a _RARE_ look
there was _RARE_ between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary _RARE_ to check on the door later
makes a very poor red _RARE_ for an inside job
to break a cellar window ''
forget , there was the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , Pauling reminded him
, with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation ''

_RARE_ of glass isn't hard to '' -- The telephone interrupted him
up the receiver and said , `` Police chief '' , into the _RARE_ , and then , `` Oh yes , Mr. Benson
hoping I'd hear from you today ''
free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened , saying , `` _RARE_ '' and `` I see '' at intervals
he said , `` Well , thank you for calling , Mr. Benson
was no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one I'm glad to have it made official ''
up
'' , he said to Madden
just heard from the _RARE_ who says Mrs. Meeker apparently died from _RARE_ ''
at his notes
minute _RARE_ in the lungs ; ; particles of _RARE_ and thread in the mouth and _RARE_
the bed _RARE_ identical with the _RARE_ and thread found in the _RARE_ and oral _RARE_
cause of death apparent
of _RARE_ and foreign objects
for _RARE_ , _RARE_ or _RARE_
of these , no gross _RARE_ of lungs , heart , brain or stomach ''

about it
the time of death
of the _RARE_ process varies , the _RARE_ says , but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper _RARE_ tract indicate that Mrs. Meeker died several hours after her _RARE_ dinner
midnight , give or take an hour either way ''
again
there it is '' , he said
your problem , of course , unless Johnston and the murderer are one and the same ''
this possibility
it was , Pauling said , he couldn't limit himself to it
to look for other prospects , other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston came to light
with his investigation centered on the _RARE_ , said that tomorrow he would go to the _RARE_ bank through which Mrs. Meeker's checks to Johnston had cleared
had to be located , they agreed
have been in _RARE_ with Johnston on the _RARE_ ; ; he might be Mrs. Meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death
_RARE_ suggestion ; ; the police chief shook his head over it
Williams was involved in the _RARE_ or the murder , then he too had another identity
the _RARE_ police had questioned _RARE_ to know any more about him than about Johnston

doubtful
that he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs. Meeker
asked to use the phone and called _RARE_ Thayer , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o'clock
that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to Mrs. Meeker's lawyers
was out for the day , but Mr. Garth would be free at _RARE_
tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a _RARE_ for which Madden should be duly grateful
that Hohlbein and Garth were _RARE_ lawyers
lunch with Pauling
_RARE_ he entered Hohlbein and _RARE_ _RARE_ suite of offices in _RARE_ _RARE_ professional building
Garth on sight , conservative clothes and _RARE_ , smile a shade too earnestly _RARE_ for a man who must be well into his _RARE_ , _RARE_ too _RARE_ quick and firm
on the make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political _RARE_ ; ; that Mrs. Garth would be _RARE_ suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; ; that she was active in the _RARE_ Club and he in _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ ; ; and finally , that neither of them had _RARE_ an _RARE_ opinion since their wedding day
that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on _RARE_ Garth
prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with _RARE_ _RARE_ as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to _RARE_ Mr. Hohlbein or him about it
not being able to find fault with so true a statement
to see a copy of Mrs. Meeker's will
one out
, October 8 , 1957 , immediately caught the _RARE_ eye
recent '' , he remarked
she in the habit of making new _RARE_ ''
no
reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death
had grown considerably
to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most ; ; particularly the scholarship fund
time the will was drawn Mr. Hohlbein mentioned to me how _RARE_ alert she seemed for her age , knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth ''

Hohlbein and I have noticed some _RARE_ since , though
them this past year , I'd say
or three years ago I doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair
consulted us , you see
did before , and showed the _RARE_ confidence in whatever we advised ''
nodded , _RARE_ this
hadn't struck him as ready to seek _RARE_ advice , least of all _RARE_
sharp tongue she'd have cut his _RARE_ to _RARE_
have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs
back to read the will
over the millions that went to Meeker _RARE_ , _RARE_ Hospital , the civic center , the Public _RARE_ _RARE_ Association , the library , and so on , _RARE_ when he came to the scholarship fund
were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker's _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ made that as long as _RARE_ Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees ( _RARE_ appointed by the bank _RARE_ the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary _RARE_ with the increased responsibilities _RARE_ of the fund would _RARE_
vote of confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected
too
for him
on to personal _RARE_ , a list of names largely unknown to him
to each of the _RARE_ in _RARE_ ( not much to blood relatives out of millions ) ten thousand to this friend and that , five thousand to another ; ; to _RARE_ Thayer , the sum of ten thousand dollars ; ; to the _RARE_ , ten thousand each ; ; to _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in Mrs. Meeker's _RARE_ at the time of the _RARE_ death
additional five thousand for each year after _RARE_ _RARE_ birthday ; ; Mrs. Meeker hadn't got around to taking care of that
bad , Madden thought
had _RARE_ the larger _RARE_
was left twenty thousand , Garth ten
no other names Madden recognized
might well have been included , he felt
had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death , and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers
up this point with Garth , who shrugged it off
people have their _RARE_ ''
one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more
, she had a number of them where money was concerned '' , Garth said
we'd have trouble _RARE_ her to make _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and I've known her to quarrel with a _RARE_ over a bill for fixing a _RARE_ ; ; the next moment she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as _RARE_ as this unfortunate Johnston affair
no telling how she'd react to spending money ''
next about the _RARE_ of the scholarship fund
an annual _RARE_ , Garth informed him
or _RARE_ had ever been found
was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator
had reached the ten thousand mark
ran another four or five thousand
didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party -- Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so _RARE_ by _RARE_ -- and found him easy enough to talk to
didn't play golf , didn't seem to belong to any local _RARE_ -- his work took him away a lot , of course -- which probably _RARE_ for his tendency to keep to himself
began to _RARE_ to his watch
that he had already told the police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs. Meeker
offer no theory to account for her murder
thing , his manner _RARE_ , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug
Mrs. Meeker had _RARE_ him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing
, _RARE_ dislike of the _RARE_ , correct lawyer _RARE_
be all right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the _RARE_ , with its probable _RARE_ of murder , led to _RARE_ door


glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; ; but for all his air of _RARE_ , who could tell what his private financial picture was
knew as he left that this was _RARE_ thinking
he made a mental note to look into _RARE_ financial background
had a downtown address
in an apartment house not over three or four years old , a _RARE_ island of _RARE_ brick and glass on the _RARE_ of the business district
a _RARE_ apartment on the fourth floor , using the second bedroom as his office
bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
a professional _RARE_ , Madden thought , and somehow as _RARE_ , as _RARE_ as its _RARE_
the rent would run close to two hundred a month ; ; in _RARE_ , perhaps twenty-five less , not all of it paid by Thayer , who could charge off one room on his expense account
Madden into the room he used as an office
a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather _RARE_
open at _RARE_ reports lay on one of them
it up and offered a drink
_RARE_
the interview , he asked if Thayer , with more time to think it over , could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston
his head
all I think about , too
her death
_RARE_ that it was murder
her _RARE_ ways , I can't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy ''
, Phil , are you trying to _RARE_ my career
what you're doing -- _RARE_ it , _RARE_ it , _RARE_ it ''
confronted Hoag on the _RARE_ front steps -- Hoag had been permitted no further -- and backed him against a _RARE_ _RARE_
had built up as he made his way here from the second floor , helped by the quantity of champagne he had _RARE_
, `` I didn't send for you , _RARE_
the captain in charge
he ''
, for God's sake , go away
in there
you there's nothing between _RARE_ and me , nothing
in your mind ''
of _RARE_ escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state
, I'm not fit to touch the _RARE_ of her garment ''
, get a grip on yourself
about you or _RARE_
some security information about the prime minister ''
at him _RARE_ through _RARE_ eyes

doesn't matter
back to the captain and tell him this : _RARE_ going to take a shot at the prime minister , and Mahzeer is in on the plot
under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with Mahzeer ''
, `` That's impossible
_RARE_ ''
it's true ''
''
trying to clear his head of the champagne _RARE_ that _RARE_ it

triumphantly
that _RARE_ it ''

us , two flights up
old man , you can't go up
even let you in the front door

to me , _RARE_

out the words
you know I can do it ''
_RARE_ hands
does it , Phil
just going
my way ''
and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back
second landing he paused to look for Docherty , didn't see him , and accepted a glass of champagne
several large _RARE_ , _RARE_ that Docherty had gone up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him
Hoag was , no telling what he might say or do
his champagne and climbed _RARE_ to the next landing
top a _RARE_ officer blocked further progress
, what is it ''

want Captain Docherty ''
Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him
, `` It's okay , _RARE_ , let him by ''
toward each other
''
, `` Hoag told me to tell you '' -- he waited until they were close ; ; it was _RARE_ _RARE_ -- `` not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer ''
_RARE_ to the captain ; ; it would be just like him
not ''
claims _RARE_ in a plot to kill the _RARE_ ''
taut : was it possible
_RARE_ himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared
, he thought ; ; the prime minister knew who his enemy was here ; ; he wasn't going to allow himself to be led _RARE_ to the _RARE_
by some wild chance Mahzeer was the man , he wouldn't dare try anything now -- not after Docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well
damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the _RARE_ truck
_RARE_ play like that one and they'd be leading him away
this had to be checked out
your friend Hoag get his information ''

the _RARE_ , Captain ''
you mind sending him up here
to talk to him ''
he continued along the corridor , _RARE_ his head into the next office for a careful look around
had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building
_RARE_ to rely on _RARE_ carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act on it
was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in the _RARE_ street
have to do something on his own

opened and three men and a woman in a _RARE_ swept past him and down the stairs
lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their _RARE_
the early _RARE_ ; ; in half an hour the reception would be over
was planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes

the prime minister would be back from the window , seated at _RARE_ desk ; ; they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting

direct the prime _RARE_ attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side

of course , would be _RARE_

side he could see farther into the _RARE_ _RARE_ window , but he saw no faces ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an _RARE_ police captain
the latter were true
rapidly along the buildings _RARE_ their _RARE_ : one was a club -- that was out ; ; two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted

closed it again
assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall _RARE_ , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; ; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance
on to the next building and found what he expected -- the _RARE_ cooking _RARE_ of a public _RARE_
wall was the brass front of a row of _RARE_ ; ; there were six apartments

on the _RARE_ meant nothing to him
_RARE_ -- he had no idea what to look for

was certain : the lock had not yielded to _RARE_ collection of keys ; ; fresh scars showed that the door had been _RARE_ open

thought no further than finding Muller

his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , _RARE_ Hoag for the moment with the same _RARE_ he had shown in their encounter at _RARE_ apartment
his left hand to the wall and _RARE_ for the switch : evil _RARE_ in the dark
was _RARE_ in light at the instant _RARE_ second shot came
_RARE_ exposed at the bright window like a _RARE_ _RARE_ in a _RARE_ headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ; his face wore a look of _RARE_
caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ; a following _RARE_ of shots shattered glass , _RARE_ the ceiling , and sent him _RARE_ heavily from the table

Docherty sent _RARE_ Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned , _RARE_ up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne

up to the _RARE_ office , leaned wearily against the gun rack that _RARE_ four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a _RARE_ gun that was occasionally tried out on the _RARE_ _RARE_
at the clerk who sat at a _RARE_ and ancient _RARE_ desk _RARE_ _RARE_

_RARE_ his head toward the _RARE_ office
to the _RARE_ door , which was open , and stood at attention while _RARE_ _RARE_ Killpath , in full uniform , finished _RARE_ his hair
_RARE_ brown hair was heavily _RARE_ , and as Killpath _RARE_ the _RARE_ through it , it stuck together in _RARE_ so that it looked like _RARE_ ribs _RARE_ to his pink _RARE_
eyed _RARE_ reflection in the mirror over the _RARE_ and then glanced back at his own face , moving the _RARE_ _RARE_ around his head
alone , Gun thought
Sam _RARE_ , fight with the whole damned Bureau
me alone
looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man , and I'm going to get him
just leave me to hell alone , Lieutenant
through _RARE_ _RARE_ at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and _RARE_
for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window
_RARE_ in a chair that did not _RARE_ , though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly _RARE_ a _RARE_ chair
before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room , including wooden file _RARE_ with some of their pulls _RARE_ off and a _RARE_ stained with the roof _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_
one thin leg up , _RARE_ his arms around the _RARE_ to press his knee into an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
the _RARE_ which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath _RARE_ his _RARE_
his chin on his _RARE_ , stretching his neck like that of a _RARE_ on a _RARE_ block , and stared _RARE_ at his sergeant

bell rang and he could hear the outside doors _RARE_ shut , closing in the assembled day watch
_RARE_ _RARE_ through his hawk nose , `` We can't have people running in any time they please , Sergeant ''
, sir ''
in , running out
it
confusion and _RARE_ ''
back in the chair , knee locked against stomach , his _RARE_ eyes fixed on Matson
silent again , possibly listening to the sounds in the _RARE_
being called
his throat
, `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , Sergeant
getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it ''
, sir ''
smiled
that nothing but _RARE_ back to back would give the lieutenant an _RARE_ and a smile at the same time
_RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , was calling out the beat assignments , but Matson couldn't make the names mean anything
called the station at three this morning '' , Killpath's _RARE_ voice pronounced
you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time ''
_RARE_ , sir ''
, now , you're just _RARE_ , Sergeant ''
_RARE_ , _RARE_ his joke

forward ; ; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again , frowning now
not taking one's command with a responsible attitude , Matson ''
himself that the old bastard was a fool
was no _RARE_ when it had rank
was out in the district , sir ''
, yes
have heard ''
a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk
might point out that your _RARE_ to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not _RARE_ limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped ''
up a white sheet of paper , dark with _RARE_ data
pulled into the driveway outside the window
it was _RARE_ 12 , the wagon , returned from _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to the City _RARE_
some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail
at the report in Killpath's hand , sure it was written by _RARE_ -- just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his _RARE_ _RARE_
in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the _RARE_ stems of his glasses around his ears and then , _RARE_ the report as it lay before him on the desk , _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ Lieutenant _RARE_ Matson one failed to see that the station _RARE_ was properly relieved two _RARE_ himself throughout the entire watch without _RARE_ on the _RARE_ activities or the _RARE_ of his section _RARE_ three permitted members of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Bureau to _RARE_ for their own convenience a _RARE_ who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station _RARE_ _RARE_ Captain O. _RARE_ Killpath of a _RARE_ occurring in the district five _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ known as _RARE_ spots for purposes of an _RARE_ and _RARE_ social nature and six '' -- he leaned back and _RARE_ off his glasses `` -- failed to _RARE_ with the _RARE_ Captain by returning promptly when so ordered

''
didn't think _RARE_ knew so many big words , Lieutenant ''
his lips
_RARE_ is an alert and _RARE_ _RARE_ officer
think his _RARE_ _RARE_ your _RARE_ , Matson ''
, hell ''
his breath a moment , pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the _RARE_ in his throat

have been _RARE_ and a _RARE_ lousy cop to boot , if I'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district
bad I didn't call you , and it's too bad I let _RARE_ use _RARE_ when he could have had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of _RARE_ procedure
not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around , and '' -- `` Let's not push our patience beyond the danger line , Sergeant '' , Killpath _RARE_
shouldn't like to have to write you up for _RARE_ as well as _RARE_ of duty ''
, his hands _RARE_ into fists at his sides
his _RARE_ to keep the fury from _RARE_ out
with _RARE_ _RARE_ Killpath was as _RARE_ and as _RARE_ as a cap pistol on a firing range
forward again , _RARE_ comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee
just remember , Sergeant , that we must all carry our own _RARE_
station can't run _RARE_ , unless '' -- He interrupted himself , looking around Gun at the doorway
, Lieutenant _RARE_ ''
, _RARE_
you hadn't come in yet ''
been here for some time ''
up , _RARE_ his head and eyed Gun coldly
sergeant is just leaving ''
come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the _RARE_ didn't work , that _RARE_ _RARE_ had thrown up all over the stairs , or that some _RARE_ bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes
the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath's office
as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office , he nodded and said good night to the station _RARE_ and his _RARE_ , not stopping to hear the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his _RARE_ out
he gave a damn what the _RARE_ sent out about Killpath's little speech on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_
didn't want to talk about it
acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his _RARE_ around the station all night , Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour ; ; because he'd be damned if he was going to be a _RARE_ _RARE_ just to please his _RARE_ _RARE_ captain
doorway he _RARE_ up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering then that he'd left them at the _RARE_
pick up another pack on his way home , if he were going home
before he started across the _RARE_ road to his Plymouth , parked in the lot under the _RARE_ trees across from the station , he knew that he wasn't going home

nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a _RARE_ turning _RARE_ of earth , exposed to the day a _RARE_ of busy creatures that had _RARE_ _RARE_ in the quiet night
at this hour was _RARE_ by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his _RARE_ of duty -- the neighborhood that had known _RARE_ _RARE_ by day
_RARE_ had purchased the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ seventeen years ago
_RARE_ worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will , and the name was written in gold in _RARE_ letters across each of the two display windows
right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and under that , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
took a razor to _RARE_ , _RARE_ , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish _RARE_ would be welcome
no problem anyway ; ; Mr. _RARE_ had only to signal from his doorway to _RARE_ aid from the _RARE_ _RARE_ children who played on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ Street
the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one _RARE_ was not the most _RARE_ , Mr. _RARE_ had no worries at all , and he said as much to Gun Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ special
honest as the day '' , Mr. _RARE_ said , and added , `` Mr. _RARE_ , I can say this to you : _RARE_ is a little too honest
tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to _RARE_ his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down
plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' -- He interrupted himself , smiling
put her in _RARE_
I don't lose so much ''
don't you just hire somebody else ''
says she has to finish a story ''

asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow , but it seems the _RARE_ is working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go ''
some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man
was George _RARE_ and he , too , had come from a good family
perhaps _RARE_ , _RARE_ set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave
always well _RARE_ and well _RARE_ , and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good _RARE_ schools and a proper university
child , he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father _RARE_ him by dying broke
he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling
went through _RARE_ mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all
had understood that _RARE_ had been engaged to a boy named _RARE_ _RARE_
grown up with young _RARE_ , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice
to ask her about _RARE_ now , but he knew he couldn't do so in _RARE_ presence
, still wondering and a little _RARE_ , he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding
did you pick him up ''
, I've known him quite a while ''
at her companion _RARE_
I , George ''
been after her for years '' , _RARE_ said , `` but I've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days ''
eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched _RARE_ hand
I tell you a secret
to get married
_RARE_ ''
his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about _RARE_ , who was eight or ten years older than the girl
whether _RARE_ was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from _RARE_ estate to _RARE_ him
this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his _RARE_ in hand
a point of frowning , of acting out the part of the fond _RARE_
have to give it some thought '' , he said
wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are _RARE_ , would you ''
a face at him and then she laughed
course not ''
get my references in order '' , _RARE_ said , and though he spoke with a smile , Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused
by any time , Casey ''
up and touched the girl's arm
on , darling
really serious about working on that story , I'd better take you home ''
them go , still frowning absently and then _RARE_ the matter as he called for his check
went out he told _RARE_ the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from _RARE_ _RARE_ and put a _RARE_ piece in the _RARE_ , he told her to be sure that it went toward her _RARE_
took him back to the bar and _RARE_ where he had left his car , and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment
mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if _RARE_ _RARE_ car was still there
, he did not think about _RARE_ Burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him
, when his glance focused on the _RARE_ and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem
where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over Burton , the _RARE_ , the sheet of paper on top of it
was _RARE_ across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note
Look in the _RARE_
the only way I could beat you was to play _RARE_ , but it was a good try , kid , and I appreciate it
stood near the wall next to the _RARE_ , and the instant Casey picked it up he knew what had happened
papers inside were _RARE_ , there was a _RARE_ of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct
the basket down _RARE_ , muttering softly and thoroughly _RARE_ with himself and his plan that had seemed so _RARE_
remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned to the kitchen to get _RARE_ drinks for himself
second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; ; then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications _RARE_ him
longer _RARE_ that Burton had _RARE_ him
thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a _RARE_ with a gun in his pocket
gun was empty
his mind had rounded out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six _RARE_ he had taken from the revolver
them with brooding eyes , _RARE_ _RARE_ as his brain _RARE_ with the problem and tried to find some solution
: `` The crazy fool '' , half aloud
the shells on the table , as though he could no longer bear to hold them
: Where the hell could he have gone
I find him
no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room , his imagination out of control
to tell himself that maybe Burton had _RARE_ up enough to get some sense
only intended to _RARE_ the _RARE_ , _RARE_ he was , in which case an _RARE_ gun would be good enough
of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton
as he turned toward the telephone , it rang _RARE_ to _RARE_ the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly
'' , he said
''
''
_RARE_ ''
the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental _RARE_ and control the disturbance inside his head
heard _RARE_ say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon ''
took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank _RARE_
picture ''

took a picture of me at the corner of Washington and _RARE_ about three thirty this afternoon ''
says so ''
of my boys ''
that much
not the sort who walked around without one of his `` boys '' close at hand
''
my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I wouldn't want that picture published ''
says it's going to be published ''
wouldn't even want it to get around ''
circumstances Casey was a little _RARE_ when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken
, he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who _RARE_ their objections properly
, however , he was still too worried about _RARE_ Burton , and the gun that had no bullets , and the story Burton had told him , to care too much about Tony _RARE_
were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice
'' , he said
was hired to take a picture
it
I know about it and that's all I care ''
you'd better tell the guy who hired you what I said ''
tell him ''
right '' , _RARE_ said , his voice still quiet
I meant what I said , Casey
picture gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it , I'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you ''
do that '' , Casey said
be sure to send your two best boys , Tony ''
up with a _RARE_ , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create
as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone _RARE_ and found _RARE_ _RARE_ home number
it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up
the bar and _RARE_ where he had picked Burton up that afternoon
was told that no one had seen Burton since then , he thought of three other places that were possibilities
he got the same answer and in the end he gave up
time he had smoked three cigarettes he had _RARE_ down
done all he could and that was that
Burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk
Casey , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible
have stayed here and watched Burton

made a mistake

telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink
did he decide he didn't want one
opening a can of beer but _RARE_ that idea too
went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes
just finished _RARE_ the right one when the telephone rang again
snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent

know me but I know you
want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can
hurry you might beat the headquarters boys ''
the _RARE_ of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision
the years he had received many such calls
them came from people who identified themselves
because he had done them a favor in the past
they expected some sort of reward for the information
passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break
occasional tip turned out to be a phony , and , like the police , Casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not _RARE_ this time
in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from _RARE_ Avenue
a district of small factories and _RARE_ buildings and occasional _RARE_ , and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the _RARE_
not bother with his radio -- there would be time for that later -- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone _RARE_ and knew instantly how he had been _RARE_
car had pulled up behind a small _RARE_ , its headlights still on
pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl , and watched Elaine rapidly _RARE_ from one station to another , tune in the null , then draw in a line on the chart
out just a little too far
_RARE_ degree straight for shore ''
in , raising his eyebrows _RARE_ as he saw Elaine
''

quick '' , she replied
you drop the _RARE_ ''
, swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward _RARE_ where he picked up the _RARE_
and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat _RARE_ into the null on the Aj
'' , Elaine said , then peered through the loop of the _RARE_ and waved to Poet
later she came behind the wheel and backed off the _RARE_ line until it was set in the ocean floor
the _RARE_ and slowly the _RARE_ swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the _RARE_ faced toward the shore
her somewhat _RARE_ as she efficiently cut the _RARE_ , and started the _RARE_ motor
up from below , wearing new bathing _RARE_
_RARE_ hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the _RARE_ and looked at it curiously
if Elaine had bought them , but he said nothing
he suddenly realized , was saying anything
as if they were all under a spell
be an excited conversation , for somewhere , directly below them , was a _RARE_ lost for more than four hundred years
of _RARE_ there was a null , like on the radio direction _RARE_
in New York , he had gone flying with some friends in a small private _RARE_ with a single engine
all been laughing , _RARE_ , when suddenly the engine had failed
had screamed
had prayed
fallen into a complete silence , listening to the wind _RARE_ over the wings
had been good
the plane on a small _RARE_ in _RARE_ and as soon as the aircraft had _RARE_ to a stop , everyone had burst into _RARE_ at the same moment
been tension in the plane during the silent _RARE_ ; ; a tension similar to the one now
the plane there was a concrete reason for it
at this moment , there should be none unless skin _RARE_ was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe
existed
_RARE_ relationship as there had been between the _RARE_ on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat
over them like a cloud , its arrival as sudden as a cloud _RARE_ over the sun
Elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the _RARE_ , Poet behind her , Nick _RARE_ behind him
back a cushion over one of the _RARE_ , unlocked a _RARE_ on the chest beneath it , then presently straightened , holding a long knife and a _RARE_ looking _RARE_ gun in her hand
softly as he looked at the gun
''


are the best ''
the locker _RARE_ shut and replaced the cushion
are the most efficient ''
the _RARE_ '' , Poet _RARE_ as he _RARE_ on his tank harness
do you need an _RARE_ ''
, _RARE_ , staring at the weapon
quite possible there's more than _RARE_ down there , man '' , Poet replied with a short , nervous laugh as he held the harness for Elaine
later , moving _RARE_ because of the swimming _RARE_ , she picked up the gun , handed the knife to Poet , then rolled off the _RARE_ of the boat , back first
to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion
and they were out of sight , leaving behind only a _RARE_ of bubbles as a clue to their _RARE_
while Nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles , wondering which set came from Elaine
close together , their air trail _RARE_ like _RARE_ traveling side by side
bubbles became lost in the _RARE_ of the ocean surface , and he rolled over on his back
hands behind his head , he stared at the blue sky
nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean
must have enjoyed being alone
the ocean , probably the _RARE_ spot was the _RARE_
uncle had stuck to this desire for _RARE_ , he probably would still be alive
wanted money wanted money to _RARE_ through the _RARE_
wanted money probably to _RARE_ among the dice tables in _RARE_ _RARE_
an odd combination a strange pair to _RARE_ upon the _RARE_ of the _RARE_
hadn't stumbled on it
three weeks prior to the _RARE_ of the Virginia , _RARE_ had been _RARE_ around the San Luis _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ with its two steel _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and Nick raised up to watch it heading south
a hell of a note , he thought
couldn't even find a _RARE_ spot anywhere on a beach to neck _RARE_ without someone _RARE_ down upon them
character flying that thing had gone over San _RARE_ Island yesterday he would have had an _RARE_
the west a beautiful _RARE_ slowly beat its way into the wind , headed on a _RARE_ toward San _RARE_
a cabin _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in the small _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ in the chair _RARE_
was right in the middle of the _RARE_
stories that the two best fishing spots in Southern California were over the La _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ , two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the _RARE_
_RARE_ had warned , the land on both sides of these _RARE_ would fall into the ocean and no more La _RARE_ or _RARE_ Beach
_RARE_ took advantage of them to pull up _RARE_
fish _RARE_ as they _RARE_ the surface because of the difference in pressure
he wondered , had Elaine wanted him along on this trip
_RARE_ , he couldn't run a boat , except on the open sea
up , stretched , looked around for the bubbles , but could see none
to the _RARE_ , he lit the _RARE_ under the coffee pot and when the _RARE_ was heated , poured himself a cup and went up to the _RARE_
the _RARE_ , he went back to the _RARE_ , stretched out on the _RARE_ and listened to the music
Poet returned together , _RARE_ up over the _RARE_ almost like _RARE_ breaking water
up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern
luck ''

his head , sliding his face mask up on his forehead
right on the edge of the _RARE_ '' , Elaine said
her face mask , she carefully placed the _RARE_ gun across the stern , then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water
is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile '' , she added as she swung her legs over the _RARE_
news ''
a thing ''
her a _RARE_ , then repeated the service for Poet
''
her head as she slipped out of her harness , but Poet nodded
still hung over the stern of the _RARE_ , but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in
on his foot caught on the _RARE_ , throwing him off balance
smashed painfully into the narrow _RARE_ and he _RARE_ as he grabbed his _RARE_ _RARE_ with his other hand and rolled into the boat
''
_RARE_ distinctly from _RARE_ lips as he struggled to his feet
became rigid
he saw Poet in a brilliant glare of horror

was still _RARE_ in pain as he studied the _RARE_ of his arm
murderer
toward Elaine , Nick saw that she , too , stood in shocked surprise
silence was too silent
of the charged atmosphere , Poet raised his head slowly , looking first at Elaine
caught the implication of the _RARE_
was frozen into the mask of a _RARE_ , her body absolutely _RARE_
Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine , himself and Poet
first , so quickly that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction
you need a _RARE_ ''
steadily
his arm
like _RARE_ a _RARE_ '' , he said , his eyes _RARE_ on Nick's face , then moved back to Elaine
like hell for a second , then it _RARE_ ''
get some _RARE_ ''
and started toward the _RARE_
walk was too steady , too slow , _RARE_ her fear
it
Poet
a cat , he leaped back , _RARE_ up the spring gun and , _RARE_ , pointed it toward the cabin
same instant , Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man
fired next to his ear with a vicious _RARE_ like the first _RARE_ of an old steam engine
same instant , Elaine screamed wildly , the sound ending abruptly as Nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic , struggling Poet
the sea closed over Nick , some _RARE_ sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic
murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage
_RARE_ on _RARE_ feet gave his legs incredible power , driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over
the _RARE_ , arms _RARE_ to his side , and he twisted _RARE_ trying to escape
escape , Nick thought grimly , because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water
would not let go
and glass face mask slipped from _RARE_ forehead , bounced _RARE_ off Nick's chin , then disappeared
again and Nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank , _RARE_ off the skin
split second , Nick relaxed his grip and _RARE_ _RARE_ body spun completely around before Nick could stop him , holding him now from the rear
at the side of Nick's head as they rolled around and around
stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water , not rising , not _RARE_
pain _RARE_ across Nick's chest and a bubble of air escaped from his _RARE_ lungs , _RARE_ _RARE_ of others that _RARE_ _RARE_ toward the surface like helium _RARE_ rising into the sky
, _RARE_ object swayed _RARE_ in front of him , _RARE_ bubbles from its flat _RARE_ head
hose was free
struck Nick like a blow
Nick flashed one hand up , _RARE_ _RARE_ neck in the bend of his elbow
same instant , he grabbed the loose , _RARE_ hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber _RARE_
_RARE_ through his nose then _RARE_ in the air from the hose
the _RARE_ pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden , wild _RARE_
this was a signal , Poet abruptly began to _RARE_ the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water
Nick held on , sucking on the hose , _RARE_ the air that belonged to Poet
not fighting Nick now
sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a _RARE_ _RARE_
rich village but not much for action -- too many solid _RARE_ , not enough tourists or working _RARE_
the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run _RARE_ -- about seven months ago
Moore looked his same _RARE_ ; ; a man mountain running to _RARE_ in his _RARE_
he said with real surprise , `` Well , well , ain't we _RARE_
the head of County _RARE_ up for this murder
climbed fast , Jed
last summer and now it's _RARE_ Jed
19 years to become Chief of our three man police force

was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth
guess it helps '' , I said , paying no attention to his _RARE_
could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop , Jed
only young but well , you don't even look like a police officer
with narrow shoulders and that brush _RARE_ hell , you'd pass for a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ set
day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law , big and tough
when my _RARE_ pounds and _RARE_ comes along , why it's the same as another _RARE_
say move , a guy moves ''
worry about my being tough , Moore
it's far too early in the day for _RARE_ lines like the bigger they come You've had your _RARE_ lecture , let's get to work
the murdered woman Mrs. Buck ''
, nice sort of woman

_RARE_ farm
the _RARE_ as a bride and Don't worry Jed , this one is in the bag
the killer , have the only road off the _RARE_ covered ''
, passed your road block as I drove in '' , I said , sitting on his polished desk
dressed like a _RARE_ , he kept a neat office
, what happened ''
nine this morning Mrs. Buck _RARE_ me she's having trouble with one of her farm hands -- money trouble
named Tim Williams -- only hand she has working for her now
with the _RARE_ workers that follow the _RARE_ up from the South last year , but Tim and his wife settled here
no trouble with him before , thought he was a hard worker , _RARE_ around to get a full _RARE_ work
Julia asks me to
Julia ''
on , _RARE_ , look alive
, the deceased '' , Moore said , _RARE_ me his _RARE_ , _RARE_ again
asks me to come out at once
didn't sound real _RARE_ you know , like there was any immediate danger
there at _RARE_ A.M. , found her _RARE_
have come sooner if I'd known
about Tim being the killer -- I have a witness
why the County had to send anybody up here
I can handle this ''
, seems you have a nice package , with all the _RARE_ tied

collar Tim before night ''
your witness ''
had -- has -- an old Indian woman cooking for her -- Nellie Harris
last of the original Island _RARE_
in the kitchen , had just come to work , when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room
recognized his voice , that Tim yelled , ' It's my money and I want it '
rushed out of the house
heard Julia phone me
on with her house work -- until I found Julia dead
you say it , Nellie ain't near strong enough to have _RARE_ Julia
doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck
: _RARE_ disappeared -- on the run
no way off the Point except through my road block
want to see the body -- have her up the street in Doc _RARE_ office ''
see it ''
up Main Street to this big white house , then around to the back
_RARE_ sole doctor , Abel was also its Medical _RARE_
was on a table , covered by a sheet
was busy up front with some of his live patients
the sheet , I examined the _RARE_ around Julia _RARE_ once slender throat
had killed her
any _RARE_ ''
shook his big head , seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body
said , `` Never noticed it before I mean , when she was dressed but for a woman her age , Julia had a real fine figure ''
the sheet , glanced at my watch
almost one and I hadn't had lunch
I wanted to get this over with , had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office
him , `` I want to go see the Buck house ''
''
down Main Street , I said , `` I saw the _RARE_ one squad car at the road block , we'll ride out in my car ''
, we'll use mine '' , Moore said , opening the door of a _RARE_ white _RARE_ _RARE_
slid in beside him he said , `` Some heap , _RARE_
_RARE_ of a buy on this , dirt cheap ''
, it's a real load '' , I told him , looking up the street at my _RARE_ Ford
minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical _RARE_ house , and when the _RARE_ stopped I managed to _RARE_
a garage and a modern barn in the rear , all of it standing between two large flat fields _RARE_ in early _RARE_
gentleman _RARE_ , the kind of _RARE_ _RARE_ money the Point is known for
of a _RARE_ were _RARE_ out of the garage , while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture
wasn't old , she was ancient -- a tiny _RARE_ woman with a face like a tan _RARE_
also stone _RARE_ in her right ear
repeated what Moore had told me
asked , `` Why didn't you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was ''
_RARE_ stared at me with her hard eyes , said , `` She didn't call
the living room last
up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom -- way I always do in the morning ''
you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about ''
wages
was a hard woman with a dollar
when I asked her to put me in Social Security , _RARE_ I wouldn't have to be working now , Miss Julia threatened to fire me -- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her ''
you hear Tim return ''
sir
until Chief Moore ''
on the kitchen table with my pencil

never see none
I wasn't her social secretary ''
she on friendly terms with other members of her family ''

a son -- killed in the war ''
into the living room
seem to be any signs of a struggle
Moore , `` Where does _RARE_ wife live ''
take you there
, this is an open and shut case and I have to _RARE_ my men at the road block soon
come on ''
80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of _RARE_
summer _RARE_ workers lived five and six to a room in these
were empty , except for a cottage across the road
Williams was about 21 , with skin the color of bitter _RARE_ , and if you _RARE_ the plain dress and worn _RARE_ , she was _RARE_ pretty
of their place was full of new furniture , five _RARE_ down and a _RARE_ a week stuff , but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home
was both sullen and frightened
she didn't know a thing -- Tim had left the house at six in the morning , as usual
seen him since
Mrs. Buck owe him any wages ''

, for this week , but they wasn't due _RARE_ Saturday
Mr. _RARE_ , no matter what anybody say , my Tim didn't kill that woman
a good man , hard working
as a _RARE_ but gentle as a baby
he angry , Tim wouldn't hurt a woman
in his life took a hand to a woman or '' `` We'll get him soon , see what he says '' , Chief Moore cut in
your husband have a car ''

us an old station wagon
for the job ''
a silly question : `` You've no idea where your husband could be , now ''
her head
she was lying
there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty
, `` Come on , Jed , I have to get to my men ''
way out I told her , `` If you should _RARE_ just happen to see your husband , get him to give himself up
a fair trial
like this won't get him anything , except more trouble , or a bullet ''

him -- if I see him ''
it back to the _RARE_ in less than four minutes
not to act scared
could really barrel along
Moore I was going to eat , get some forms filled out by Doc Abel
said , `` If I don't see you when I return , see you for certain at my road block , _RARE_ ''
a bowl of decent _RARE_ , _RARE_ the Doc and he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl -- in a half hour
pipe , I took a walk
is a big _RARE_ _RARE_ in the summer
, there were several slick _RARE_ tied to the _RARE_ , an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ inside the _RARE_
a 34 foot _RARE_ with Chief _RARE_ in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the _RARE_
a new boat , about five years old , but fitted with fishing _RARE_ and chairs
an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was _RARE_
, `` You bet
is _RARE_ crazy about blue fishing ''
into the doctor's office , picked up my forms
was walking back to the Police _RARE_ , which was in the same building with the City Hall and Post Office , I saw Mrs. Tim Williams _RARE_ into the back of my car
moved gracefully , she was _RARE_ at it
into the front seat
' hiding ' on the floor of the back seat , the soft curves of her back and hips -- _RARE_ lines
out of the _RARE_ , turned off into a dirt road among the _RARE_ pine trees and stopped
a few minutes and she sat up
moment we didn't talk , then she began to weep
, `` I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim ''

saw him so anxious before '' , I said , lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette
course , it could be because this is his first murder case
where Tim is , don't you , Mrs. Williams ''
on the cigarette slowly , sitting slumped against the back seat ; ; didn't answer
police have dropped the case
you to go to Pearson City and find out why -- _RARE_ stuff for your modern crime series
same train _RARE_ Beauclerk took and get there at the same time
the same hotel and _RARE_ the same suite -- 1105 ''
the hotel rent it so soon after the crime ''
not
have finished with it
the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper
hotel people , you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite ''
, they may not want to rent it ''
your _RARE_
, keep your eyes open ''
what ''
growing more and more _RARE_
police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a _RARE_ _RARE_
people will have _RARE_ and _RARE_ it
one , it's even been _RARE_ ''
always a chance they may have _RARE_ something '' , returned the chief
_RARE_ on that chance
_RARE_ and _RARE_ who waited on Beauclerk
_RARE_ of the suite
local color
Beauclerk did
imagine you're going to be murdered yourself -- between eleven p.m. and one _RARE_ the night you arrive ''

way to spend an evening ''
thought wiped the _RARE_ from his face
the murderer should return to the scene of the crime ''
eyes _RARE_
softly
is exactly what I'm hoping for
, the murderer is still at large
key to the suite is still missing ''
train Alec _RARE_ his memory of the Beauclerk case by reading _RARE_ _RARE_ -- _RARE_ stories about the crime sent out by the Pearson City _RARE_ , a member of the _RARE_ _RARE_
was a _RARE_ _RARE_ living in New York
ago she had gone west to Pearson City
, her _RARE_ husband , lived there
the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce , _RARE_ and Stacy
Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight to the Hotel _RARE_
the junior partner of her law firm , Martin Stacy , and asked him to call at her hotel that evening
time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in _RARE_ of further _RARE_ if she _RARE_
Stacy , she told him she was planning to _RARE_ and she wanted him to ask Forbes for the lump sum
that it would _RARE_ Forbes , who had just _RARE_ all his money in a real estate venture
he left her suite at nine _RARE_ p.m.
in good health and spirits , but still determined to get the money from Forbes
saw Stacy leave
_RARE_ inquired for her that evening
she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a _RARE_ revolver in her brain
the medical _RARE_ , she was shot between eleven p.m. and one _RARE_
was locked and the key was missing
the gun
finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed _RARE_ Beauclerk
motive and Stacy had opportunity
motive for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case would be solved
_RARE_ proved to be one of the older hotels in Pearson City , and definitely _RARE_
impression of the lobby was _RARE_ , _RARE_ dignity -- black _RARE_ and red _RARE_ , a black and white _RARE_ floor , and _RARE_ _RARE_
the night clerk as a man measures an _RARE_
like the room I had the last time ''
, sir ''
was young and limp , with a tired smile
you recall the number ''
was 1105 ''
smile _RARE_
suite is taken ''
went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk
number 1105 stood one word : _RARE_
glance followed _RARE_
have better rooms vacant now '' , he _RARE_
and more comfortable
same rate ''
was dark , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
looked _RARE_ and he could look dangerous
looking dangerous now
his voice
wrong with the _RARE_ in 1105 ''
a sudden stillness in the lobby
, who had been _RARE_ like _RARE_ , were struck dumb
, lighting a match for his cigar , paused until the flame burned his fingers
_RARE_ on their bench were listening
eyes _RARE_
course not ''
with a _RARE_ disease been in there ''
''
was almost _RARE_
just that -- well , 1105 is being _RARE_ ''
don't believe it ''
on the desk , holding the _RARE_ eyes with his
you tell me the real reason '' , he _RARE_
might be a story in it ''
''
with the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ Service
get the story -- or I get the suite ''
_RARE_ and the clerk knew it
is no story '' , he _RARE_ _RARE_

gentleman to 1105 ''
_RARE_ as Alec followed a _RARE_ across the lobby to the elevator
feel eyes on his back
it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly
on the _RARE_ floor was dimly lighted by electric _RARE_ at intervals of thirty feet
, _RARE_ carpet muffled every _RARE_
end of the corridor Alec noticed a door marked : Fire _RARE_
a neat _RARE_ for murder
unlocked a white door _RARE_ 1105
was dark but a _RARE_ sign flashed and faded beyond the window
_RARE_ _RARE_ down through that _RARE_ red glow , _RARE_ as falling feathers
boy switched on a ceiling light
looked normal and even _RARE_
no hint of a violent struggle now
with a _RARE_ finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store
rug was _RARE_ bright and new
never been stained with blood
and towels were clean , _RARE_ empty and supplied with fresh matches
over the bureau was a blank eye , round and innocent
the part of an innocent tourist
there anything wrong with this room ''
''
dropped his eyes
you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut ''
raised his eyes
, _RARE_
want my advice , pack up and take the next train back to New York ''
you on duty here two weeks ago ''
hesitated
`` I'm not talking
wouldn't spend a night in here for a million _RARE_ ''
in a hurry to get out of the room
him a tip and let him go
Alec examined the doors
three -- one leading to a bathroom , one to the hall , and one to the room next door which was _RARE_ -- locked or _RARE_ on the other side
the hall door and put the key with his watch on the _RARE_ table
just quarter of nine
ranged his _RARE_ on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the _RARE_ cover
like the dust that _RARE_ in an _RARE_ room , but white
use white face powder _RARE_ , he recalled
pink , tan , or _RARE_ powder
into the bathroom
the _RARE_ where the murderer appears to have washed his hands
clean now , but Alec decided against a bath
into bed and switched off the light
darkness he could see the _RARE_ reflection of the _RARE_ sign on the wall opposite the window
as steadily as a _RARE_ -- on , off -- on , off
than five minutes Alec was asleep
knew just what woke him
he was _RARE_
no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the red light on the wall
still , listening to the silence , watching the light
the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes -- midnight
the medical _RARE_ she was shot between eleven p.m. and one _RARE_
a faint sound
seemed to _RARE_ and knock against the wall of his chest
sound was inside the room
his _RARE_ _RARE_ and breathed heavily , _RARE_ sleep
was coming nearer
shadow fell across the illuminated wall , _RARE_ and _RARE_
_RARE_ sign faded out , the shadow disappeared
_RARE_ sign flashed on , the shadow was still there
to an impossible height , climbing the wall to the ceiling
that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light -- in this case , the window
_RARE_ his muscles , ready to jump
betrayed him with a _RARE_
vanished
moved beyond the range of the light from the window
, Alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch
could snap it on , a _RARE_ blow caught him in the ribs
out _RARE_ with his right
a thick , _RARE_ crack of fist on flesh
_RARE_ his knuckles
everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be
_RARE_ his fist
a _RARE_ , curiously _RARE_ , like that of an animal in pain
shook the floor as it dropped
a moment , on guard

groped for the light switch
rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room
bare _RARE_ a man lay face down
a short , heavy , powerful body
him over and discovered a round , _RARE_ face with narrow , _RARE_ eyes -- a primitive _RARE_ face from Russia or the _RARE_
shoes were too pointed , his _RARE_ too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist
a slight _RARE_ under the left _RARE_ -- a shoulder holster
removed the gun
familiar with this type
seen it in the _RARE_ at Police _RARE_ in New York , in Broadway night _RARE_ and _RARE_ Avenue pool rooms , in the criminal courts
was surprised to meet it here
had no connection with the _RARE_
_RARE_ would not have killed her with a weapon of such small _RARE_ as a
he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much _RARE_ to take his _RARE_ for a _RARE_ ride on a lonely country road
_RARE_ _RARE_
his eyes
are you doing here ''

made no reply
were _RARE_
were _RARE_ and swollen where Alec had hit him
you kill _RARE_ Beauclerk ''
an _RARE_ denial , but there was no response at all
, come on , snap out of it
turn you over to the police ''
was getting on _RARE_ nerves
opened his mouth , but no words came
curious , animal _RARE_ Alec had heard during their fight
you speak English ''
opened his mouth wider
pointed toward his _RARE_
forward to look
hideous scars inside the throat and the _RARE_ was _RARE_
time I shall get to the _RARE_ _RARE_ , to Red _RARE_ and Handley Walker , to murder and sudden death
realize , I am sure , how much old _RARE_ _RARE_ to new ones , and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones
in _RARE_ that _RARE_ _RARE_ and his sister sat by a _RARE_ fire in their house on Dogtown Common , a _RARE_ place even then
_RARE_ his razor
'' , said he `` do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven ''
answered , `` I don't know , but I hope you'll never do such a thing ''
_RARE_ , `` God _RARE_ ''
, and went out and cut his throat in the cave near Granny _RARE_ _RARE_
this to do with the present
I assure you
know what gets into people , even such as Red and Handley , before you can tell what comes out of them
learned , both of them , about _RARE_ _RARE_
I beg you not to forget him
is not laid
Handley , God help them , knew the old Dogtown _RARE_ ; ; and I knew they knew it , for I'd told them a lot of it
it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows
gentlemen , I am getting to the point , to my point
the facts ; ; they are set forth in your own newspapers
from me the story , but a story is about ' why ' and then , perhaps , about how
when ' you know ; ; yesterday morning
I am trying to tell you is the ' why ' -- that is my point -- and that concerns the spirit of the matter
an _RARE_ and a _RARE_ to old furniture ( look at that _RARE_ _RARE_ behind you ) which has a _RARE_ _RARE_ , if I may say so
too , have their haunting qualities

point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter
hold the spirit of a thing , then somehow you know the truth -- you know a _RARE_ _RARE_ from the real thing
truth is what you've come for , is it not
Dogtown is one of those places that _RARE_ into the _RARE_ as _RARE_ get into old wood , under the _RARE_
, all the folk who lived on the back of _RARE_ Ann , they are not just like others
different _RARE_ on them
no _RARE_ _RARE_ here because everyone had a _RARE_ in the family
of old _RARE_ _RARE_ who pulled the teeth of Dark _RARE_ ( her real name was _RARE_ ) , and because he _RARE_ the job and left two _RARE_ _RARE_ she put such a _RARE_ on him that he thought his legs were made of glass
he was never known to run or even walk fast
is the only deserted village in all New England that I know of
_RARE_ , a small _RARE_ , with towns like _RARE_ near by ; ; but now it's the most lost and _RARE_ place in the world
lived in that _RARE_ of rocky _RARE_ took on some of the _RARE_ _RARE_ character
it is the last _RARE_ of a great _RARE_ , but one rather feels that only a _RARE_ giant could have piled up those _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended , ominous life in them
up there later
a mile from here where we sit
one single dwelling left there , though once , in the early _RARE_ century , there were close to a hundred houses
myself have identified about sixty _RARE_ , from the old _RARE_ and _RARE_
pursuit , I assure you
I can remember nothing but ruined _RARE_ and tumbled _RARE_ , and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man
now a _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , with oak , _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ across the common , and everywhere the _RARE_ and the long , long shadows
setting , and a sinister one
that in your reports
for so many things
_RARE_ and Handley Walker lived nearby , almost as near as I do
at _RARE_ , and from his house he could be up on the Common in a half _RARE_ _RARE_ walk ; ; Handley lived further on , at _RARE_ _RARE_
find one or other of them up around Dogtown _RARE_
both _RARE_ , ( They were

one say
, anyhow , Dogtown Common is so much off the _RARE_ track _RARE_ that only Sunday _RARE_ still stray up there , from time to time
railroad , lack of water , killed Dogtown
dead as a brass door _RARE_ , and I sometimes feel like the _RARE_ , for I'm about the last to be even interested
Red and Handley well
said , they were both _RARE_
, separately , to _RARE_ some twenty years ago -- there's always been an _RARE_ _RARE_ somewhere on _RARE_ Ann -- and each married here
cousins , _RARE_ and _RARE_ Norberg
a lot of _RARE_ in this neck of the woods , and many still make painted furniture and take _RARE_
among them , with blonde hair and _RARE_ faces
_RARE_ and Red , of the red beard , married _RARE_
was because of an old Norberg _RARE_ that I got to understand them all so well
ended in a ridiculous draw , but I must tell you about it
yes , I'm quite sure it's important , because of the _RARE_ _RARE_

that's what gave me the feeling , gave me _RARE_ the spirit , the _RARE_ , evil spirit of this whole affair
, besides being _RARE_ of _RARE_ , I am also _RARE_
I don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things
as well as the next man that a ship is called from the _RARE_ she carries , where the live wind _RARE_ , and not from the _RARE_
got to know both
the _RARE_ interests me also
was saying , I've known all about the old records , including the old Norberg _RARE_
years ago that page was torn out , I don't know by whom
years ago , Handley came to ask me if he could see the _RARE_ register
_RARE_ and casual about it , as though it were of no consequence
like that , in spite of being a big man
you see him , you'll notice his habit of _RARE_ , I might almost say , _RARE_ a large _RARE_ with black hairs on it , by his right temple
_RARE_ man , but very _RARE_ , some would say slick
_RARE_ black hair
outside manners , to my taste
the sort who , with an _RARE_ eye , would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then _RARE_ her
gentleman , I feel , would do neither
worn a _RARE_ hat , and I've noticed , in my small study at the Society , that he rather _RARE_ of _RARE_
week , cousin Red wandered in as casually , but _RARE_ and _RARE_
small and _RARE_ , like _RARE_
asked to see the same page
told him someone had torn it out , he shouted
God , it's that damn Handley , the _RARE_ ''
in the same week they both came together to examine the register
were alone in the building -- so few people _RARE_ are interested even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other days -- for they began to _RARE_ each other in the _RARE_ language
out his _RARE_ beard , Handley _RARE_ under his suddenly _RARE_ black hair
_RARE_
et _RARE_ _RARE_
both
was _RARE_ , yet that day the _RARE_ Handley was the louder of the two
my presence , they would have been at each _RARE_ _RARE_
quarrel I learned what the trouble was , from the _RARE_ each _RARE_ at the other
_RARE_ had suddenly become valuable
fine _RARE_ quarry there , and _RARE_ coming back for public buildings
knew it was in the Norberg family _RARE_ , but to which of the cousins did it belong , _RARE_ or _RARE_
I knew almost exactly what the will had said
with a _RARE_ , of course
that the judge of _RARE_ of _RARE_ County , _RARE_ or _RARE_ , appointed three _RARE_ of _RARE_ to divide and establish the Norberg estate
usual _RARE_ _RARE_ , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased _RARE_ Norberg , one lower room , on the Western side , _RARE_ to the well and _RARE_ and to one third of the cellar ( I can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one _RARE_ Right , and _RARE_ they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as _RARE_ , namely the _RARE_ _RARE_
remember that the whole of the _RARE_ , not counting the _RARE_ _RARE_ , was _RARE_ at twenty pounds
you could have seen the _RARE_ fall on these two _RARE_ _RARE_ when I told them that obviously the _RARE_ belonged to their _RARE_ _RARE_
scene , ridiculous as it was , remained in my mind
picture of bad blood , to be further _RARE_ with _RARE_ if _RARE_ colors , for on a subsequent day I saw Handley _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ wife , up on Dogtown Common
it would be _RARE_ to _RARE_ my presence
I _RARE_ go _RARE_ , but the _RARE_ up there are very high and I am a small woman
cause of _RARE_ between them I must tell you

_RARE_ as Red _RARE_ was , he was much the better painter
Handley knew it
had a show at _RARE_ , Handley would hurry to hang his pictures in _RARE_
say this has little _RARE_ , but , gentlemen , remember that all this prepared my mind , _RARE_ my intelligence
_RARE_ the pattern takes shape
call these the motives of crime
call them the patterns of life , perhaps even the _RARE_ of _RARE_
all this knowledge I had nothing of substance to _RARE_ our case , as you would call it , till yesterday
ago , on the _RARE_ of October , was the opening of the _RARE_ season in _RARE_
to shoot , but there are a few _RARE_
too , if you care for them , which most of the folk around here haven't the sense to appreciate
than they have the sense to eat _RARE_
the day Red was said to have gone away
, he'd talked about doing so
, he often disappeared , from time to time , -- off to paint the sea , aboard a _RARE_ out from _RARE_
his wife , never seemed to mind
these _RARE_ gave her more _RARE_ for her _RARE_ with Cousin Handley
I wasn't surprised , early that morning , to see Handley himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back Road
he didn't have his gun , which he should have
have been a good excuse for his being there at all
had been up there by seven o'clock , after _RARE_ , since _RARE_ been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as _RARE_ glass
the man had said
_RARE_ at his drinking companion through _RARE_ , _RARE_ eyes
no ready answer , as much from surprise as from the fit of _RARE_
man drunk or crazy or both
_RARE_ buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count , and the man's eyes were still clear
is off his _RARE_ , Haney thought to himself , and looked away from those eyes
were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them
he noticed it before
the man was not drunk He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger
of course , he remembered now
_RARE_ , after two hours of steady drinking , but the occasion of it came back to him
, his head seemingly _RARE_ in thought , started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving _RARE_ roared through the intersection
and a horn _RARE_ furiously , but the man would have been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before
had been _RARE_ , something anybody might have done without thinking , on the spur of the moment
matter of fact , he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit
he _RARE_ having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them
, the stranger was _RARE_ Haney _RARE_ and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend
driver started to _RARE_ at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his _RARE_ record
man he saved turned and looked _RARE_ into the truck _RARE_ face , without saying a word
, the driver stopped _RARE_ at them , turned on his _RARE_ and went back to his truck
given it much thought at the time
recalled it very clearly , and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off
have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word
light went their way , they went on across the street
the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars , he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them
went alone and kept to himself , sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite _RARE_
decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks , even though he made good money at his job
like that
wondered if it was worth it , having a _RARE_ for company
didn't take the offer seriously , but he began to feel uneasy
finally got the _RARE_ under control , he realized that Pete ( all he gave was his first name ) was still waiting for an answer -- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare
a weak laugh
I can't think of anyone , Pete
''
_RARE_ appeared between the man's eyebrows
think you aren't taking me seriously , Phil
it
has some kind of _RARE_
have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you
in returning favors
anything for somebody I like
cost you a cent , Phil
and try me ''
his forehead wearily
beginning to feel _RARE_
would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit
didn't expect anything to come of it , and there were a few people `` All right '' , he _RARE_ finally , `` if you must know , I don't get along with the landlord
riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath
the neighbors _RARE_ , but I don't believe it
they tell me themselves if it _RARE_ them ''
closed his eyes and nodded
looked up again , he seemed almost _RARE_

your address
take a little time
to study your _RARE_ habits and movements first
, I always make it look like an accident
, if it looks reasonable
way there's no trouble for the customer ''
flew up
''
_RARE_
my line of work '' , he said Five minutes later , before Haney could make his break , the stranger stood up and nodded farewell
the small but _RARE_ man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure
to stay a little longer , and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass on the table
before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the _RARE_ , putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep
day , Sunday , the _RARE_ reminded Haney where he had been the night before
in turn reminded him of his conversation with the _RARE_ , and he _RARE_
for more _RARE_ later in the day , and passed the _RARE_ landlord on the way -- he was still alive and _RARE_ as usual , as if tenants were a burden in his life
and ignored him
back to work Monday
the landlord was still alive
On Thursday , Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife _RARE_ , and wished the stranger could do something about her _RARE_ home from work , he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building
lobby , people were standing around , talking excitedly
crawled with a _RARE_ _RARE_ as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened
had died
afternoon , it seemed , he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection
apparently been alone
the fall -- just the _RARE_ impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance
that nobody noticed his sudden _RARE_ , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks
something about how terrible it was , and walked with deliberate _RARE_ to the elevator
his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped _RARE_ in a chair
while he began to feel better about it , especially when no one bothered to ask any questions
all , why should they
, he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence
really had nothing to do with it , of course Haney went to bed , happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord
, the man had no family , so no one suffered , and everybody was better off for it
he said to himself , nobody _RARE_ a man just as a favor
thought I didn't mean what I said
eyes were large and sad , as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings
like a _RARE_ , _RARE_ dream , but now the dream was beginning to take on _RARE_ of a nightmare
Haney knew it was not a dream
be very tight , but he knew where he was
the same bar , and it was two weeks later -- Saturday night , when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual
been sitting in the usual corner at the little table , as far as possible from any _RARE_ , friendly _RARE_
enjoying the weekly _RARE_ of washing down his _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ slightly _RARE_ with water
_RARE_ was not the landlord
already quite forgotten about him
, he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment
_RARE_ was _RARE_
end of his fourth _RARE_ _RARE_ , while he was _RARE_ making wet _RARE_ on the _RARE_ with the bottom of the glass , he became aware that he was not alone
up with _RARE_ eyes and _RARE_ the stranger sitting across the table , smiling a secret smile at him , as if they were fellow _RARE_
even noticed -- what was his name

hadn't seen him sit down
was _RARE_ , like a shadow , and made as much noise as a shadow
like _RARE_ out of sight , but he was already _RARE_ in the corner with the _RARE_ , dark little man
to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing
going to be _RARE_ from now on with a creep for a _RARE_
to start going to some of the other places again
low voice , almost _RARE_ , the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back
the mistake of answering in an _RARE_ way , and instantly realized that his _RARE_ must have showed in his face or voice
slightly , then became sad and _RARE_
want to encourage his company , but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow , to prevent possible trouble
was no trouble
_RARE_ over his drink , obviously upset by _RARE_ lack of appreciation
the uncomfortable silence , Haney began to talk
, and two drinks later , he was _RARE_ bitterly about his wife , He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his _RARE_ -- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes
paused to _RARE_ his throat , the stranger broke in
why pay her bills
runs around with other men , and if you hate her as you say , why not just divorce her ''

bitch would love a divorce '' , he _RARE_
she'd get half of everything I have
deal -- you know
to sell out my business to pay her off with her share
drop dead ''
_RARE_
yes
see
understand , I haven't been in this state too long
out here to _RARE_
I -- why I do a free job now and then
have told me about her before ''
a _RARE_ of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again
wild thought ran circles through his _RARE_ brain
just suppose this guy was really what he said he was
professional killer If he was just a nut , no harm was done
he was the real thing , he could do something about _RARE_
very _RARE_ , very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot
_RARE_ intended '' , he said gently
it's just that -- well , you know
didn't suspect a thing , and I thought it was a coincidence
, I didn't know you , Pete
have been an accident ''
casually
if you say you managed it '' The stranger was _RARE_
burned _RARE_
, yes '' , he muttered impatiently
course it looked like an accident
work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi
prove it , Phil
I can manage one more favor for you ''
eagerly
the liquor in the bottom of his glass
back Pops groped against a wall and stopped , pulled away two loosely _RARE_ wide boards at one end , and went through
'' , he whispered ; ; `` floor _RARE_ about three feet down , so don't fall ''
through and down , into pitch darkness
, `` _RARE_ stay still
the boards back and then get us a light
where you are ''
stayed where I was while he _RARE_ around and then walked away
later he struck a match and lighted a candle , and I could see
a big room , empty except for a few things of _RARE_ at the far end -- a wooden _RARE_ on which stood the candle , a spread out blanket , and an _RARE_ _RARE_
back over my shoulder while I went to join him ; ; he'd hung another half of a blanket over the _RARE_ window so no light would show through
the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as I sat down beside him on the spread blanket
first '' , I said
and handed it back
place '' , I told him
, I got a buddy I travel with , real nice guy named _RARE_
where he is , right near here
join the party and sleep here tonight too
be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you ''
a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` _RARE_ '' , and I _RARE_ him
bring a bottle too , and I'll get another one or maybe two while I'm out
work on this one while I'm gone , kill it if you want ''
a short _RARE_ from it myself and handed it to him
_RARE_ '' was enthusiastic this time
the bottle down
over by the window while there's light , an' I'll put _RARE_ candle out
come back I'll put it out _RARE_ till you're both inside ''
waiting , leaning against a building front
_RARE_ '' , I told him
we got to go back to Fifth and get another bottle or two
way I'll give you the _RARE_ ''
way I gave him the _RARE_
another pint of _RARE_ and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark , put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again
my friend _RARE_ to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable
still a little , not much , left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it , and Charlie opened his
reminded , _RARE_ , by a poem of _RARE_ _RARE_ called The _RARE_ of Two Men by a Young _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , which _RARE_ himself read on a record against jazz background
consisted of only two words , the word `` Wait '' , repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different _RARE_ , and then the word `` Now ''
_RARE_ final _RARE_ from the jazz group
the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing _RARE_
could wait all right ; ; there was no hurry
, `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , _RARE_ the reference
the record together once
bottle passed a few times
taking long ones , but not showing the effect yet
as drunk as when I'd first talked to him , but no _RARE_
a capacity ; ; if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine
through the second bottle , Charlie looked at me across Pops , who was sitting between us and asked `` Now ''
, `` Wait '' , and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink
handed it back and I had hold of it safely , Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now '' , to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once
a lead pipe _RARE_
a sound like the one you produce by _RARE_ a _RARE_ with your finger , only louder , and Pops fell forward from the waist and then over _RARE_
, if not dead ; ; and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him
my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a _RARE_ , but Charlie said `` Wait ''
said it sharply , not as in the _RARE_ bit , but as an order -- so I stopped my hand and looked at him
holding the piece of lead pipe out to me
don't want to know whether he's dead , yet
that blow to be _RARE_
him and maybe or maybe not kill
again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not
we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the _RARE_

him , I saw his point ; ; it made sense
the piece of pipe from _RARE_ hand and used it , harder than he had
was louder , anyway , and I thought I heard bone crack
, `` Good boy
it , if mine didn't
never know which
, now I'll give you a hand ''
Pops up and I made sure there was no trace of a _RARE_
to Charlie
put him down again the way he was
more natural position ''
that
do you feel ''
me
'' , I told him
do you feel ''

I'm _RARE_
a kick , but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again , except for _RARE_
not talk about it _RARE_ until we're out of here
first question : the bottles
take them all with us , or leave one ''
them '' , I said
we left one we'd have to wipe it for _RARE_
picture we want to leave for the _RARE_ -- whenever the body gets found
in the middle of a drinking _RARE_ with another _RARE_
been working on a bottle or a _RARE_ he'd have taken it with him ''

have taken the weapon with him too , so we take that
-- He looked around
been careful about _RARE_
you ''

the boards over the window , of course , but they're not painted and too rough to take _RARE_
for the rough _RARE_ of the _RARE_
I doubt if the cops will even try _RARE_
dead _RARE_ every day , maybe they won't even _RARE_ him for the cause of death ''
can't take a chance on that
to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent
other _RARE_ who killed him would have turned out his pockets
that ''
that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change
the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might _RARE_ _RARE_ -- and the change
the candle and decided the hypothetical other _RARE_ would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out
had been stuck on a tin _RARE_ so it wouldn't set fire to the _RARE_ when it _RARE_ out
wouldn't have _RARE_ except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner
not be found for days , even weeks , otherwise
once more over every point , then _RARE_
up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger , and we weren't picked up by a cop
, nobody saw us , cop or citizen
a quiet street with no _RARE_ and was completely deserted at that hour
if it matters , was one A.M.
three hours ago we'd decided , in _RARE_ _RARE_ pad on _RARE_ , to commit a trial murder
gone like _RARE_
_RARE_ , I found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous
is too safe
that can get you into a _RARE_ pad
later we were back in my _RARE_ pad , killing what had been left of the second pint
to leave the third one intact for tomorrow
plans for me to commit _RARE_ murder and for him to commit mine
were really going to do it
hands on it
ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could _RARE_ notes
him everything I'd learned about _RARE_ habits and habitat , and he'd tell me the score on _RARE_
the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at _RARE_ _RARE_ pad
get there early because he had the key
on in , the less Charlie and I were seen together in public , or visited one _RARE_ rooms , the better
dead tired and slept _RARE_ , as far as I know _RARE_
at _RARE_ and decided we were set to stay as long as it took , into or even through the evening , to talk things out
brought food and we'd decided on no drinks
along the _RARE_ pint from last night , but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking
first , telling him everything I knew about _RARE_ and his house and domestic arrangements
_RARE_ and floor plans ; ; he _RARE_ them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down
me equivalent and even more detailed _RARE_ on _RARE_ , including _RARE_ -- one of the apartment building _RARE_ lived in and one of the apartment itself
there several times , back when , while he and _RARE_ had been friends , or at least not enemies
take us as long as we'd thought it might ; ; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said , `` Well , I guess that's it
_RARE_ a coin to see which of us goes first
you rather deal a hand of _RARE_ _RARE_ or play a game of _RARE_ _RARE_ , or what ''
a minute , Charlie '' , I said
thing we haven't discussed , expense money
some at least , if only bus _RARE_ to the scene of the crime
you're as flat broke as I am , I think we'll have to take the added risk of _RARE_ over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work ''

right , I'll come clean
a little _RARE_ for a _RARE_ day , and I guess this is _RARE_ enough
of hundred
draw the short straw I'll _RARE_ you some bread , like fifty _RARE_ , before I take off to visit my sister in _RARE_
after I'm back , another fifty so you can put some _RARE_ on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while I take care of your seat cover boy ''
'' , I said
a deep breath , and the _RARE_
that case , let's not draw
to bat first
to wait till _RARE_ back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with _RARE_ to have her have an alibi for _RARE_
wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything
friend _RARE_ can go any time ''
and _RARE_ me on the shoulder
was hoping you'd say that , _RARE_
wouldn't have suggested it
in that case , I take off tomorrow morning for _RARE_
in case , I brought the money with me ''
he knew himself to be self he was free to _RARE_ ever closer to his brothers , _RARE_ without let
was and is and ever had been
to _RARE_ all his brother _RARE_ , the many _RARE_ on Mars , corporate and _RARE_ , the precious few on Earth -- the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to _RARE_ with and _RARE_ now that at last long waiting he _RARE_ and _RARE_ himself
in _RARE_ ; ; there was much to _RARE_ , loose ends to _RARE_ over and fit into his growing -- all that he had seen and heard and been at the _RARE_ Foster _RARE_ ( not just _RARE_ when he and Digby had come face to face alone ) why Bishop Senator _RARE_ made him _RARE_ uneasy , how Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had _RARE_ _RARE_ in the jumping up and down and _RARE_ -- _RARE_ _RARE_ coming and going -- _RARE_ words troubled him most ; ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a _RARE_ , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in
`` church '' which turned up over and over again among _RARE_ words gave him _RARE_ difficulty ; ; there was no _RARE_ concept to match it -- unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` _RARE_ '' and many other words and _RARE_ them to the _RARE_ of the only world he had known during _RARE_ then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by _RARE_ , by Digby
art God ''
closer to understanding it in English now , although it could never have the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ concept it stood for
mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the _RARE_ word and felt closer _RARE_
like a student telling himself that the _RARE_ is in the _RARE_ he sank into _RARE_
he _RARE_ his heart , resumed normal breathing , ran down his check list , _RARE_ and sat up
been weary ; ; now he felt light and gay and _RARE_ , ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him
a _RARE_ need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet
out into the hall , was delighted to encounter a water brother
''

Mike
you look _RARE_ ''
feel fine
everybody ''

_RARE_ went home an hour ago and people started going to bed ''
''
disappointed that _RARE_ had left ; ; he wanted to explain his new _RARE_

hungry ''
, I'm hungry ''
on , there's some cold chicken and we'll see what else ''
downstairs , loaded a tray _RARE_
take it outside

fine idea '' , Mike agreed
enough to _RARE_ -- real Indian summer
on the _RARE_ ''
bother '' , Mike answered
carry the tray ''
see in almost total darkness
that his _RARE_ probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up , and Mike _RARE_ this was true but _RARE_ that there was more to it ; ; his _RARE_ parents had taught him to see
the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on _RARE_ _RARE_ but his water brothers had little _RARE_ for changes in temperature and pressure ; ; he was _RARE_ of their weakness , once he learned of it
was looking forward to snow -- seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read -- walking _RARE_ , rolling in it
_RARE_ he was pleased with the warm night and the still more _RARE_ company of his water brother
, take the tray
on the _RARE_ lights
plenty to eat by ''

by the pool , then lay back on the grass and looked at stars

the _RARE_ we left at the _RARE_ , one has _RARE_ and the others are sad ''
I heard it in the news ''

_RARE_ , _RARE_ together , Mike said softly and triumphantly : `` _RARE_ art God ''

as their _RARE_ made them ever closer and Mike felt himself almost ready to _RARE_ her voice called him back : `` Oh

God ''
_RARE_ God ''

_RARE_ were building pressure _RARE_ for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship
faster than scheduled as the _RARE_ were helpful
the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a _RARE_ plan to free bound oxygen in the _RARE_ of Mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations
_RARE_ neither helped nor _RARE_ this plan ; ; time was not yet
were approaching a violent _RARE_ that would shape _RARE_ art for many _RARE_
elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of _RARE_ marks and spaces ; ; Time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the _RARE_ _RARE_ Daily _RARE_ should be translated into the medium

of the United States proclaimed the first Sunday in November as `` National _RARE_ Day '' and urged America to say it with flowers
parlor chain was _RARE_ for _RARE_
, after secret _RARE_ , announced the _RARE_ second Major _RARE_ : Supreme Bishop Digby had been translated _RARE_ to Heaven and _RARE_ to _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Foster
news had been held up pending _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of a new Supreme Bishop , _RARE_ _RARE_ -- a _RARE_ accepted by the _RARE_ _RARE_ after lots had been cast repeatedly
_RARE_ published identical _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ and the Christian Science _RARE_ ignored it , Times of India _RARE_ at it , and the Manchester _RARE_ simply reported it -- the _RARE_ in England were few but extremely _RARE_
not pleased with his promotion
from Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished -- and that stupid _RARE_ _RARE_ was certain to _RARE_ it up
with _RARE_ patience until Digby ran down , then said , `` Listen , junior , you're an angel now -- so forget it
no time for _RARE_

you can submit a _RARE_ for a _RARE_ if you want to make a fool of yourself
I'm telling you , it'll be turned down -- you don't understand the System yet

their show their way -- the _RARE_ has variety , something for everybody -- a fact you field workers often miss ''

not hear of _RARE_ disappearance when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a _RARE_ suspicion , he dismissed it ; ; if Mike had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it -- and what happened to supreme _RARE_ worried Jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered
had gone through an upset
what had happened but did not know with whom -- and didn't want to _RARE_

it was high time the boy was _RARE_
_RARE_ the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting -- _RARE_ _RARE_ D , then _RARE_ _RARE_ A or _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , or _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , through all ways that four women can gang up on each other
most of the week following that _RARE_ trip to church , during which period Mike stayed in his room and usually in a _RARE_ so deep that Jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before
not have _RARE_ it if service had not gone to pieces
seemed to spend half their time _RARE_ in `` to see if Mike was all right '' and they were too _RARE_ to cook , much less be _RARE_
Anne -- Hell , Anne was the worst
subject to _RARE_ tears Jubal would have bet his life that if Anne were to witness the Second _RARE_ , she would _RARE_ date , time , _RARE_ , events , and _RARE_ pressure without _RARE_ her calm blue eyes
and time involved are _RARE_
we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two
learned much about _RARE_ _RARE_ since a hundred years ago ; ; that is all I can tell you about them
the third ship came back several years ago and reported '' `` That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already _RARE_ by _RARE_ beings ''
, _RARE_ in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak
_RARE_ to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes
did you know ''
sharply
me , _RARE_ '' , said Hal
it was inevitable
the _RARE_ _RARE_ in his Time and the World Line that such a planet would be found
it was on page _RARE_ ''
and said , `` I am glad that your _RARE_ lessons have left such an impression ''
they not

they were not the only impressions
bear scars on my back where _RARE_ , my gapt , _RARE_ me because I had not learned my lessons well enough
a good _RARE_ , that _RARE_


grew older and was promoted , so was he , always where I was
my gapt in the _RARE_
the _RARE_ gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him
now my block gapt
the one responsible for my getting such low M. _RARE_
came the _RARE_ , the protest
not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me
get a low M. R. , I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does
die , I die because I _RARE_ it so
forgive me , _RARE_ , for the _RARE_ thoughts
_RARE_ me again , _RARE_ '' , said Hal
did the expedition find any records of the _RARE_ having been on this planet
even , though this is too much to wish , find the _RARE_ himself ''
'' , said Macneff
that does not mean that there may not be such records there
was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth
tell you now the distance in _RARE_ or what star this was , though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere
_RARE_ , you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves
leaves very soon ''
need a linguist ''

ship is huge '' , said Macneff , `` but the number of military men and _RARE_ we are taking limits the linguists to one
considered several of your professionals because they were _RARE_ and above suspicion
Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning
he said , `` _RARE_ , only one _RARE_ linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition
`` A thousand _RARE_ '' , said Hal
I have just thought of one thing
married ''
problem at all '' , said Macneff
will be no women aboard the Gabriel
if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce ''
, and he said , `` A divorce ''
his hands _RARE_ and said , `` You are _RARE_ , of course
from our reading of the Western _RARE_ , we _RARE_ believe that the _RARE_ , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce
in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years
he _RARE_ the provision in obscure language
great and _RARE_ wisdom , he knew that our enemies the _RARE_ must not be able to read therein what we planned ''
_RARE_ '' , said Hal
me more , _RARE_ ''
later , Hal _RARE_ stood in the observation _RARE_ of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth _RARE_ above him
night on this hemisphere , but the light _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , Japan , China , _RARE_ Asia , India , _RARE_
the linguist , saw the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ in terms of the languages spoken therein
the _RARE_ Islands , Japan , and northern China were _RARE_ by those members of the _RARE_ Union that spoke American
, all of _RARE_ Asia , southern India and _RARE_ , these states of the _RARE_ _RARE_ spoke _RARE_
_RARE_
turned the _RARE_ swiftly for him , and he _RARE_ Africa , which used _RARE_ south of the _RARE_ _RARE_
the _RARE_ _RARE_ , Asia _RARE_ , northern India , and _RARE_ , _RARE_ was the native tongue
Europe , between the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March
no man's land , _RARE_ by the _RARE_ Union and the _RARE_ Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years
would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second _RARE_ War
for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( _RARE_ outside its own _RARE_ )
spoke all of the world's _RARE_ _RARE_ , plus a new one called _RARE_ , a _RARE_ whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose _RARE_ was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper
in his mind the rest of Earth : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ Islands , and the eastern half of South America
peoples spoke the tongue of _RARE_ because that island had gotten the jump on the _RARE_ who were busy _RARE_ North America and the western half of South America after the _RARE_ War
was North America , where American was the native speech of all except the twenty _RARE_ of _RARE_ living on the Hudson Bay _RARE_
that when that side of Earth _RARE_ into the night _RARE_ , _RARE_ City would _RARE_ out into space
somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment
would soon no longer be living there , for she would be _RARE_ in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to _RARE_
weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her _RARE_ way , though in public she would be _RARE_
and professional _RARE_ would _RARE_ with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought _RARE_
_RARE_ had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way
no such thing as an `` accident ''
all the other _RARE_ ( also supposed to have died in this _RARE_ of elaborate _RARE_ to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die
therefore , being in _RARE_ , they would not be _RARE_ and their _RARE_ flung to the _RARE_ in public ceremony
the fish could eat their bodies for all the _RARE_ cared
sorry for Mary ; ; he had a time keeping the tears from _RARE_ to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation _RARE_
he told himself , this was the best way
Mary would no longer have to _RARE_ and _RARE_ at each other ; ; their _RARE_ _RARE_ would be over
free to marry again , not knowing that the _RARE_ had _RARE_ given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage
have a year in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt
the psychological barriers that had prevented her from _RARE_ _RARE_ child would no longer be present

if this happy event would occur
as frozen below the _RARE_ as he
who the _RARE_ for marriage selected by the gapt The gapt

no longer have to see that fat face , hear that _RARE_ voice `` Hal _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ voice
slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned
the _RARE_ _RARE_ man , smiling _RARE_ up at him
beloved ward , my _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , said the _RARE_ voice
had no idea that you , too , would be on this _RARE_ _RARE_
might have known
to be bound by love ; ; _RARE_ himself must have foreseen it
you , my ward ''
love you , too , my _RARE_ '' , said Hal , choking
wonderful to see your _RARE_ self
thought we would never again speak to each other ''
Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under _RARE_ acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , _RARE_ percent of the speed of light
all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the _RARE_
would lie in suspended _RARE_ for many years
later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others
sleep while the _RARE_ drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the _RARE_ bodies of the personnel could not have _RARE_
the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would _RARE_ towards the star which was its _RARE_ end
later , the _RARE_ apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to _RARE_ _RARE_
a force too strong for _RARE_ bodies to _RARE_ would be applied
after _RARE_ the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a _RARE_ _RARE_
crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended _RARE_
would then _RARE_ the rest of the personnel
in the _RARE_ left before reaching their destination , the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed
was among the last to go into the _RARE_ and among the first to come out
to study the _RARE_ of the language of the chief nation of _RARE_ , Siddo
from the first , he faced a difficult task
that had discovered _RARE_ had succeeded in _RARE_ two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words
of the Siddo _RARE_ was very restricted
as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases
caused Hal anxiety
was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak _RARE_
if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be _RARE_ his students _RARE_
even getting this across would be difficult
thing , the _RARE_ of speech of the _RARE_ _RARE_ differed somewhat from _RARE_ ; ; the sounds made by these _RARE_ were , therefore , _RARE_
true that they could be _RARE_ , but would the _RARE_ understand these _RARE_
was the grammatical construction of Siddo
tense system
_RARE_ a _RARE_ or using an _RARE_ particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word
the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , _RARE_ , and , in the future , _RARE_
use of an entirely different word applied for all the other _RARE_
fact that Siddo not only had the normal ( to _RARE_ ) three _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , but the two extra of _RARE_ and spiritual
_RARE_ was _RARE_ , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo
of indicating _RARE_ varied according to tense
other parts of speech : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ operated under the same system as the verbs
not , for the _RARE_ , just a matter of running through a logical or _RARE_ chain , or deciding on some action from some already established _RARE_
the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer
was being asked to do now , however , was to _RARE_ all his basic assumptions , make _RARE_ on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives
not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an _RARE_ it takes time
, perhaps , especially in an _RARE_ , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago
reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause , however , did not make it seem any less long to Jack
already become used to _RARE_ snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked
nothing he could do but wait
were cast
Gabriel spoke
_RARE_ you '' , he said slowly
had concluded that no race as _RARE_ as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice
we have before us the example of the great races at the _RARE_ center ; ; individually they are nearly as _RARE_ as you -- the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exists
have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young
recommend to them that they _RARE_ your trial period by half
now , it is clear that we were in the wrong
_RARE_ your property , and the _RARE_ on Hesperus is lifted
you may speak ''
did not perceive this essential distinction either , _RARE_ '' , Hesperus said at once , `` I was only _RARE_ a concept that Jack taught me , called a deal ''
, you were its agent
what is the nature of this concept ''
a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said
regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given ''
, he discovered , was _RARE_
instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth
, this process is called _RARE_
is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty
major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine
property was much less important ''
'' , Gabriel said
apparently impossible
might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us ''
and _RARE_ '' , Jack said , `` show that we do ''
; ; but this one was not nearly as long
it is a matter of pleasure ; ; of curiosity ; ; of a more alive time
those could be commodities under this concept
should understand , Jack , that Hesperus and _RARE_ are not long out of the nursery
Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older ''
a great deal
the more reason , then '' , Jack said , `` why we must have a treaty
_RARE_ _RARE_ your young and give them proper living quarters , in return for their help in running our fusion _RARE_
must know if this is in accordance with your customs , and must have your agreement they will not _RARE_ the power we put in their hands , to our hurt ''
this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the _RARE_ of their own _RARE_ , and respect yours in turn
we of course agree ''
a wave of complete _RARE_ , but in a second it had vanished without a trace
was asking was that mankind _RARE_ all its _RARE_ moral judgments , and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws
in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the _RARE_ -- but they had no _RARE_ notion of man's _RARE_ habit of passing and _RARE_ laws which were contrary to his own _RARE_ and _RARE_ of his nature
treaty principle that Gabriel was asking him to _RARE_ , in short , was nothing less than total trust
would serve
might be , considering the uncomfortable _RARE_ the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of _RARE_ , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a _RARE_ of war
even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of Jack's total _RARE_ could not understand how the principle could ever be _RARE_
whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion , not trust , as the _RARE_ and _RARE_ attitude toward all _RARE_
was some _RARE_ for it
of _RARE_ agreements , for instance , had been _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; but the United States and the Union of Soviet _RARE_ _RARE_ nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test _RARE_ , and a sort of _RARE_ acceptance of each _RARE_ good intentions on this limited question
that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world _RARE_ of the United Nations ; ; suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of _RARE_ as the _RARE_ _RARE_ between _RARE_ and California over water supplies
agreements `` in principle '' , with the _RARE_ details to be _RARE_ out later , were _RARE_ in _RARE_ history
with them was that they almost never worked , and in fact an agreement `` in principle '' _RARE_ turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled
this one were to work
no question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least
could be convinced of that It was worth trying
, it had to be tried
be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had ever signed
had taught Jack , at least partially , to be content with small _RARE_ in all _RARE_ matters ; ; but there was no small way to handle this one
back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips
was too late
lost his audience
moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw
to be only a _RARE_ of color , light and meaningless activity
he realized that the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ had vanished , and that the _RARE_ learning dance of the nursery had been broken up
in the nursery were _RARE_ wildly in all directions , seemingly at random

on here
''
brothers have been found
on their way here ''

see them
don't show them ''
can't see them yet , Jack
in range in a short while ''
the _RARE_ , the boards , and the _RARE_ again

there was a tiny _RARE_ on the radar ; ; and it was getting bigger rapidly
was the skiff , it was making _RARE_ speed
skiff _RARE_ into sight , just a dot of light at first against the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ , Jack could see that both _RARE_ were still attached to it
was still _RARE_ , though there were a good many holes in it , as _RARE_ had predicted would be the case by now
a startling , almost _RARE_ sight ; ; but even more _RARE_ was the fact that it was _RARE_ an enormous _RARE_ of Angels
was not heading for the nursery , however
unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the _RARE_ , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a _RARE_
would be no chance of _RARE_ them -- without the _RARE_ generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could _RARE_ his fusion power the skiff would be gone
helpless , he watched them pass him
, ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars
never have believed , without seeing it , that the _RARE_ little vessel could go so fast
was it going
was it causing so much _RARE_ among the Angels , and being followed by so many of them
only one possible answer , but Jack's _RARE_ mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar _RARE_ of the _RARE_ course into the computer
on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with , however
was headed for the very center of the _RARE_ -- toward that place which , Jack knew now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the _RARE_ life and religion
clear that _RARE_ had at last found a way to _RARE_ the _RARE_ attention
equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off
10 _RARE_ would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not
he did ; ; after all , he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had to work from , and he was an almost _RARE_ _RARE_ man
having talked to the Angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line
decided , perhaps , that the center of the cloud was a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith ''
didn't matter now whether he meant to _RARE_ the Holy of _RARE_ , or was simply headed in that direction by accident
was _RARE_ , it was now also unnecessary ; ; and whether _RARE_ or not , the outcome would be _RARE_
under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had _RARE_ from the _RARE_ generator switch
was back on his feet again and about to _RARE_ the _RARE_ , however , he hesitated
to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff , and he had to have it fast
power in the _RARE_ _RARE_ was what had _RARE_ all the trouble in the first place -- and he already had an _RARE_ aboard
''
''
going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do
can't take you to Earth yet
got to _RARE_ my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble
_RARE_ this , or will you help
it's not part of the _RARE_ , and your _RARE_ might not like it ''
else can live in your _RARE_ while I am in it '' , Hesperus said promptly
for my _RARE_ , they have already admitted that they were wrong
of this incident they become angry with Earth , I will not be permitted to go there at all
course I will help ''
_RARE_ sigh of relief , Jack _RARE_ the _RARE_ back in and threw the switch
_RARE_ transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board
, it had taken five minutes to -- Of course
in there
on out , the _RARE_ was going to be _RARE_ than any space _RARE_ man had ever dreamed of
he had failed to _RARE_ it , he lost the five minutes anyhow , in _RARE_ an _RARE_ orbit
, don't use this _RARE_ vector trick of yours , please
his bulk up and supported it on one elbow
his eyes _RARE_ with one huge _RARE_
, Nogol , you guys okay ''
wrong with me that couldn't be _RARE_ '' , Nogol said
say what would cure him ; ; he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself
black eyes darted inside the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his face
''

''
, let's take a _RARE_ look at the country around here ''
rolled open on the landscape
of _RARE_ _RARE_ the horizon , the color of _RARE_ _RARE_
, the sky was the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above _RARE_ , seen against _RARE_ snow
, empty sky was full of fire and light
almost a magnification of the _RARE_ itself , of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ up by some master _RARE_
_RARE_ was actually only a belt of minor planets , almost like the _RARE_ belt in the original _RARE_ System
were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , for no known reason not all of them did
be the fifth mapping expedition to the _RARE_ of _RARE_ in three generations
months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the _RARE_ of _RARE_ in ancient history
can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely ''

the captain , so he could ask questions like that
can be lonely in a crowd '' , Nogol said _RARE_
will we need outside , Ryan ''

_RARE_ '' , the captain answered
can _RARE_ out there , all right
won't be easy
world lost all of its helium and trace _RARE_ long ago
oxygen are about it ''
, look over there '' , Nogol said

ship
intelligent , maybe _RARE_ ''
think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm _RARE_ quietly
get no _RARE_ from them at all
electronic , _RARE_ -- all blank
these _RARE_ , they're stone dead ''
, you and I will have a look '' , Ryan said
hold down the _RARE_ , Nogol
easy ''
'' , Nogol confirmed
heard a story once about a _RARE_ who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an _RARE_ reading on him
I know the mind of an officer works in a strange and _RARE_ manner ''
not worried about you _RARE_ the _RARE_ , Nogol , just about a _RARE_ like you reading them at all
when the little hand is straight up that's negative
start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark ''
I'm _RARE_ ''
him what he could do then
, and followed the captain through the _RARE_ with only a glance at the _RARE_ gauge on his _RARE_
negative field his suit set up would help to _RARE_ bacteria and insects
the types of _RARE_ that could attack a _RARE_ _RARE_ were not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories
likely to come down with hot _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ fever
the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the _RARE_ gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground
day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow
from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and came to the _RARE_ sprawled on its side
it with a boot
, this is pretty close to a _RARE_ ''
'' , Ryan admitted
of the best matches I've ever found
it has to happen
and all
it sometimes gives you a _RARE_ feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping _RARE_ on some strange world
you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke , and somebody has been everywhere before you even started ''

don't know , _RARE_
as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me
, for one thing
, that's not definite proof ''
, it isn't '' , Ekstrohm said
think we'd better let it lay until we get a _RARE_ picture of the _RARE_ _RARE_ around here
_RARE_ , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead _RARE_ represent
them ''
looks like we did , when we made _RARE_ ''
what about our landing was _RARE_ to the creatures ''
''

planet is very low in radiation from _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output
dose of radiation might knock off these _RARE_ ''
don't know about that
would work the other way
they have had virtually no _RARE_ exposure and don't have any _RARE_ stored up , they could take a lot without harm ''
maybe it was the _RARE_ we set up
it's _RARE_ _RARE_
up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a _RARE_ ''
'' , the captain admitted
this stage of the game anything could be possible
one possibility I particularly don't like ''
that is ''
it was not us that killed these _RARE_
is something right on the planet , native to it
hope it doesn't work on _RARE_ too
went real sudden ''
in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet
made camp outside the _RARE_
no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground , they simply had to get out
was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , _RARE_ with a _RARE_ _RARE_ to alert the _RARE_ to the approach of any being
had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced _RARE_ on board the ship
in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on _RARE_ _RARE_
a _RARE_ of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground
were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the morning sun
he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration _RARE_ on board
knew the others were sleeping more _RARE_ , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had _RARE_ them to send them riding high vacuum
not asleep
could be an end to pretending
off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor
up
no longer any need to hide
was there to do
changed for him

he could walk around , leave the light on , read

had informed him he was mistaken about this
they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and _RARE_ that he forgot
he was absolutely correct -- he never slept
processes only slowed down enough for him to _RARE_ fatigue _RARE_
fell into a waking , _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; but he never slept

he couldn't let his _RARE_ know this

invariably took advantage of him
couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their _RARE_ for them or write their reports
hell did he get off threatening to report any _RARE_ on their part to the captain
with _RARE_ had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him
to hide his secret
camp , instead of _RARE_ , hiding the secret was easier
secret itself was just as hard
up a _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ library , a book by _RARE_ , the famous _RARE_ century expert on sex
a few lines on the social _RARE_ of a _RARE_ nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ style
, he _RARE_ up the heat control on his _RARE_ and slid back the _RARE_ of the bubble
through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar _RARE_ , _RARE_ the frozen _RARE_ of the thin air

as her development within her shell lived up to expectations , and there were no _RARE_ from the pituitary _RARE_ , Helva would live a _RARE_ , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary , `` normal '' being

were _RARE_ to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a _RARE_
between optimism and _RARE_ , the _RARE_ attitude of the shell people led them to _RARE_ themselves , their ships and personnel , from _RARE_ situations
Helva , the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her
work out a method , _RARE_ her limitations , whereby she could sing
the problem by _RARE_ the methods of sound _RARE_ through the centuries , human and _RARE_

and the proper _RARE_ of vowel sounds within the oral _RARE_ appeared to require the most development and practice
did not , strictly speaking , _RARE_
purposes , oxygen and other _RARE_ were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained _RARE_ by solution in their shells
, Helva discovered that she could _RARE_ her _RARE_ unit to sustain tone

not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ as she pleased
, to Helva , only a matter of the correct _RARE_ and _RARE_ control required by the music attempted
authorities remarked on her curious _RARE_ , they did so among themselves
were encouraged to develop a _RARE_ so long as they maintained _RARE_ in their technical work
anniversary of her _RARE_ year in her shell , Helva was _RARE_ _RARE_ and installed in her ship , the Aj

perhaps there were no partners available and I've had no _RARE_ from Central ''
herself Helva sounded a little _RARE_ but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field
had had the company of other shells and more recently , _RARE_ by the score
_RARE_ had lost its _RARE_ charm and become _RARE_
_RARE_ from Central is scarcely a cause for _RARE_ , but there happen to be eight other guys _RARE_ their _RARE_ to the quick just waiting for an _RARE_ to board you , you beautiful thing ''

, not knowing what B'dikkat meant , and the _RARE_ man answered for him , `` I think he has a nice baby head , but it isn't big enough for you to take yet ''
noticed the needle touch his arm
turned to the next knot of people when the _RARE_ hit Mercer
to run after B'dikkat , to _RARE_ the lead _RARE_ , to tell B'dikkat that he loved him
and fell , but it did not hurt

happy to be here ''
covered with growing hands came and sat beside them
warmth and good _RARE_
that she looked very distinguished and charming
out of his clothes
foolish and _RARE_ to wear clothing when none of these nice people did
women _RARE_ and _RARE_ at him
corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the _RARE_ of a drug so powerful that the known universe had _RARE_ it
of his mind he was happy
how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this
to tell the Lady Da , but the words weren't quite straight
_RARE_ hit him in the _RARE_
went after the pain and swallowed it
like the cap in the hospital , only a thousand times better
was gone , though it had been _RARE_ the first time
himself to be deliberate
his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay _RARE_ nude beside him in the _RARE_ , `` That was a good _RARE_
will grow another head
make B'dikkat happy ''
Da forced the _RARE_ of her bodies in an upright position
, `` I'm strong , too
talk
man , remember
live forever
die , too , we can die like real people
so believe in death ''
at her through his happiness
course you can
this nice '' With this he felt his lips _RARE_ and his mind go _RARE_
wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything
beautiful place , among all those _RARE_ and attractive people , he sat and smiled
_RARE_ his _RARE_
how long the _RARE_ had _RARE_ him
the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ without _RARE_ or movement
of nerves and _RARE_ of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing
his own body with remote , casual interest
Da and the _RARE_ woman stayed near him
long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms
he _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ at them , and _RARE_ back into the _RARE_ _RARE_ from which he had emerged
the sun rise on occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining
no meaning
fed him in their mysterious way ; ; the drug _RARE_ out his needs for _RARE_ of the body
he noticed a return of the _RARE_ of pain
themselves had not changed ; ; he had
all the events which could take place on _RARE_
them well from his happy period
had noticed them -- now he felt them
to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again
at him with _RARE_ , remote happiness ; ; apparently her many _RARE_ , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for _RARE_ the drug than did his body
him well , but was in no condition for _RARE_ speech
lay on the ground , arteries _RARE_ _RARE_ behind the _RARE_ film which protected his _RARE_ _RARE_
the man's shoulder
woke , recognized Mercer and gave him a _RARE_ sleepy grin
A good _RARE_ to you , my boy
of a play
ever see a play ''
mean a game with cards ''
'' , said the half-man , `` a sort of _RARE_ with real people doing the figures ''
never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but I '' -- `` But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle ''
'' , said Mercer , a little ashamed of his _RARE_
'' , said the half-man
I think of plays
know what is going to happen
know when it is going to happen
know what the _RARE_ will do '' -- he _RARE_ at the _RARE_ in which the _RARE_ men were _RARE_ -- `` and we all know what the new people will ask
never know how long a scene is going to take ''
a ' scene ' ''

that the name for the needle ''
laughed with something close to real humor
, no , no
the _RARE_ on the brain
is just a part of a play
we know the order in which things happen , but we have no _RARE_ and nobody _RARE_ enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes
seems short and the pleasure seems long
to think that they are about two _RARE_ each ''
not know what an `` _RARE_ '' was , since he had not been a _RARE_ man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time
received a _RARE_ _RARE_ , turned red in the face , shouted _RARE_ at Mercer , `` Take it out , you fool
out of me ''
looked on _RARE_ , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to Mercer , and wept _RARE_ and quietly to himself
could not tell how long it was before B'dikkat came back
have been several days
have been several months
B'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ; once again they _RARE_ like children
B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of _RARE_ _RARE_ -- a sleeping child's head , covered with light hair on top and with _RARE_ eyebrows over the resting eyes
the _RARE_ needle
cut the head from _RARE_ _RARE_ , he felt the knife grinding against the _RARE_ which held the head to his own body
the _RARE_ _RARE_ as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of _RARE_ pain , as B'dikkat _RARE_ the wound with a _RARE_ _RARE_ which stopped all bleeding immediately
time it was two legs growing from his chest
had been another head beside his own
that after the _RARE_ and legs , waist to _RARE_ , of the little girl which had grown from his side
the order
not count time
smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place
lost the extra _RARE_
_RARE_ , she was a pretty and _RARE_ woman ; ; but the _RARE_ thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` People never live forever ''
this _RARE_ comforting , even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it
occurred , and _RARE_ changed in appearance , and new ones arrived
took the new ones , resting in the _RARE_ sleep of their _RARE_ brains , in a _RARE_ to be added to other _RARE_
in the truck _RARE_ and _RARE_ without human speech when the _RARE_ struck them
Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin
to fight the _RARE_ of _RARE_ to do it
memory of previous hurt , _RARE_ and _RARE_ made him sure that if he did not ask B'dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it
itself , he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there
agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway
through the public address box built into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain , so that the pink herd of talking people _RARE_ gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting to tell them
said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been on _RARE_ : `` Standard years -- _RARE_ years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes
, fellow ''
away
little corner of his mind , which stayed _RARE_ through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat
the _RARE_ to remain on _RARE_
him happy without _RARE_
a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day , surrounded by a family of little _RARE_ _RARE_ himself
despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of B'dikkat
fate he accepted
the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan
kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it
back to the group
Da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a _RARE_ hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her
_RARE_ square miles of _RARE_ space around them , but he appreciated the _RARE_ of her gesture none the less
The years , if they were years , went by
of _RARE_ did not change
_RARE_ sound of _RARE_ came faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; ; those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain _RARE_
night and day , but no setting of _RARE_ , no change of season , no generations of men
still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so _RARE_ with the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the _RARE_ that the words of the Lady Da took on very remote meaning
never live forever ''
was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe
not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to _RARE_ the experience of each for the wisdom of all
no dream of escape for these people
saw the _RARE_ chemical _RARE_ lift up from the field beyond _RARE_ cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen _RARE_ of _RARE_ flesh
ago , some other _RARE_ than one of these had tried to write a letter
was on a rock
it , and so had a few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it
they care
, scraped on stone , had been a message home
still read the opening : `` Once , I was like you , _RARE_ out of my window at the end of day , and letting the _RARE_ blow me gently toward the place I lived in
like you , I had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands
part of my head was called a face , and I could talk with it
can only write , and that only when I get out of pain
told himself he would forget Ann _RARE_
well rid of her
didn't want a wife who was _RARE_ as Ann
had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble
of this was _RARE_
woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann , and then could not get back to sleep
and dreams had _RARE_ around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing
thing would be to sell out to _RARE_ _RARE_ and leave the country , but there was a stubborn _RARE_ in him that wouldn't allow it
_RARE_ for the bitterness and disappointment that _RARE_ him was hard work
that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake
he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; ; each day the hurt was a little _RARE_ , a little less _RARE_
plenty of work to do
summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years
in the _RARE_ came fast , now that the warm weather was here
not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the _RARE_ in his _RARE_
no idea how much time _RARE_ would give him
case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his _RARE_ and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence
every few minutes and leaned on his _RARE_ as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with _RARE_ calm
in late afternoon on the last day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle
be some kind of trick _RARE_ had thought up
walked in this country , least of all Ed _RARE_ or Dutch _RARE_ or any of the rest of the Bar B crew
the two figures for a time , puzzled
were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever
his _RARE_ , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started _RARE_
had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , _RARE_ toward the house
saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and _RARE_ , _RARE_ , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet
house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands
through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty
dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door
there , making no effort to get back on her feet
came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring
, thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one
think it was possible for this couple to be pretending
licked his dry lips
, `` Could we have a drink ''
his head toward the front door
the kitchen '' , he said
Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl
up
in the house ''
move or say anything
were _RARE_ as if she didn't hear or even see him
reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked
was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry
hair was _RARE_ , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection
have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was _RARE_ and bleeding
her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house
_RARE_ light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious
suspicion that this was a trick _RARE_ _RARE_ had thought up was _RARE_
would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him
she had a sweet face that attracted him
her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table
a good deal _RARE_ , Morgan thought
blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features
the dipper from the water _RARE_ on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth
_RARE_ , and murmured , `` Thank you '' , as he lowered her head
looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition
seen a few _RARE_ wagons go through the country , the families almost _RARE_ to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two
dropped off to sleep
to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several _RARE_ of water from the spring which he poured into the _RARE_ _RARE_ that he had placed on the stove
his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy
are you and what happened to you ''

Billy Jones '' , the boy answered
my wife _RARE_
out of money and we haven't eaten for two days ''
are you doing here ''
we in Wyoming ''

five miles north of the line ''
as if relieved
been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down ''
mean you dragged your wife all over _RARE_ _RARE_ looking for work ''

town of _RARE_ only about six miles from here
you go there ''
didn't want town work '' , Jones said
is a mighty empty country '' , Morgan said
only one more ranch three miles north of here
_RARE_ to death if you'd missed both places ''
we're lucky we got here
give us a job , Mr. '' `` Morgan
''
silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the _RARE_ , but he knew nothing about the couple
kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house
the possibility at once
thin face haunted him
the face of a killer
so sure about the boy
shaved for several weeks , his _RARE_ beard giving his face a _RARE_ , _RARE_ expression
more to this than Jones had told him
running from something
an _RARE_ to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either
could use some help '' , Morgan said finally , `` but I can't afford to pay you anything
you'd better go on in the morning ''
work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly

she's cooked in a restaurant
hard , Mr. Morgan ''
see '' , Morgan said
now you need a meal and a bath
in terrible shape ''
know '' , Jones said _RARE_
the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table
meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl
, `` I've got some supper ready ''
her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair
a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was _RARE_
are you
we get here ''
Dan Morgan
the _RARE_ Aj
down in front of the house , and I carried you in
you a drink and then you went to sleep ''
''
at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; ; then she murmured : `` You're very kind , Mr. Morgan
take in all the _RARE_ who come by ''
don't have many _RARE_ coming to my front door '' , he said
you can walk to the table ''
course ''
to her feet , staggered , and almost fell
her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen
down at the table , shaking her head
sorry , Mr. Morgan
a very strong woman , but I'm awfully tired ''
hungry '' , he said
in
much of a meal , but it's what I eat ''
much of a meal ''
cried
Morgan , it's the _RARE_ food I ever saw ''
himself he had never seen two people eat so much
were finally satisfied , Jones said , `` I think he's going to give us work ''
way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself
saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on
, `` I guess the Lord looks out for _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ ''

are you ''
not _RARE_ '' , she said
all I'm sure of ''
him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark
the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a _RARE_ in the wall
: `` You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath
are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones
to go to town to see the _RARE_ ''
, _RARE_ be all right '' , Jones said quickly
mean , we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town ''
see '' , Morgan said
you find me a needle and thread ''
asked
dress needs some work on it ''
and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and _RARE_
: `` I'm going to bed ''
at the door in front of him
my spare bedroom
isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there ''
awfully kind '' , the girl said
pay you back if you'll let us
''
all right '' , he said
get up early
sleep ''
him into the front room , closing the door behind him
: `` If it's all right with you , Mr. Morgan , I'll sleep out here on the couch
slept together since we started
can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together '' He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't _RARE_ why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place ''
got fired '' , Jones said
had to do something ''
a pair of lost , _RARE_ kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed
wearily
can't stay here with me
and you said they'd be here by dawn ''
can't make me go ''
down again into his chair and began to rock
thinking of _RARE_ and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the _RARE_
the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt
black shirt his frail shoulders shook and _RARE_ of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain _RARE_ free in slow _RARE_ , terrible to see
to call back the face of the man he had known
other man he could _RARE_ his anger ; ; against this bent man in the chair he was _RARE_
moved so that Clayton had to _RARE_ to catch the words
you remember Big Charlie ''

stuck with me all these years
_RARE_ _RARE_ , never said much , never meant _RARE_ to me , but he stuck with me
into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son
a fair fight , the boy _RARE_ it -- Big Charlie told me so
him
Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago
, they all left me
out
understand why , Clay
all cleared out
them fair '' He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder
you mean '' -- he asked almost _RARE_ -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're _RARE_ ''
''
don't hate me any more ''
, shook his head , _RARE_ , `` No ''
here ''
man _RARE_ with one finger and Clayton went forward to him
his arms around his chest and _RARE_ him _RARE_
my life '' , he said , `` I tried

you _RARE_ away -- but I tried
wanted no part of me when I had so much to give
_RARE_ left of me
gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me

Heaven , I can't refuse you now
mock me too much
you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears
go , Clay ''
himself from the embrace and stepped back
followed him _RARE_
horses
much time
the horses and bring them round
ready '' He burst from the hot _RARE_ of the room into the cold night air
was in the barn and he tightened the _RARE_ over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words
had finished he led him and the mare to the porch
had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to _RARE_ the _RARE_ , shaking his head
the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck
had backed away
take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered
doesn't want you now
it easy , your time will come ''
on the porch , a thin figure
taken a _RARE_ down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock _RARE_ on the wood floor
to him and he came slowly down the steps
'' , he said , `` where are we _RARE_ ''
a ranch in the valley
there I have to see
take her with us -- to California
know yet , it's crazy ; ; I have to think about it
is where we're _RARE_ ''
''
to nod
a new land
could make a mark there
, together like us , we could do _RARE_ fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been
fresh , the two of us , like _RARE_ had ever happened ''
, like a father and son ''
made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered
made you so you could stand up
you a man ''
, Gavin , you did ''
the horse and laid a hand on the _RARE_ quivering neck
me up , Clay
up , I feel kind of stiff ''
him gently into the saddle , like a child
hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said
_RARE_ it down
my garden ''
will grow again -- in California ''
loved this valley '' , he whispered _RARE_
alone here for three years , before any man came
by the river
nice then , so peaceful and quiet
no one but me
want to leave it ''
into the saddle and _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_
horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness
rode at a measured pace through the valley
come soon and the night was at its _RARE_
had _RARE_ below the black _RARE_ of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked _RARE_ , as if no man had ever _RARE_ before
as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his _RARE_ and _RARE_ suddenly to the _RARE_ of an _RARE_ or the _RARE_ of a blade of grass in the _RARE_ wind -- a savage land , _RARE_ and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men
bitterly
_RARE_ landscape the _RARE_ of his desires passed before his mind
them _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of the broken and the dying
his mind groped to _RARE_ the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life
_RARE_ him , made him bend low over the _RARE_ neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search
_RARE_ that were framed dark gray against the black hills
last the darkness began to _RARE_
line of _RARE_ broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky
light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first _RARE_ the contours of trees and _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though _RARE_ eyes of two men _RARE_ a few hundred yards away in the _RARE_ shelter of the trees
men _RARE_ their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence
in _RARE_ were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and _RARE_
liquor had flushed their courage
the news _RARE_ , as though they had been _RARE_ of purpose
their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire
his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked
_RARE_
you wanted , isn't it
with him , _RARE_ him out of the valley
'' -- `` Keep out of this '' , _RARE_ _RARE_
not your brother , he's Gavin's son
, he _RARE_ to us when he said he was _RARE_ alone ''
was thinking back many years
thought of the time he had _RARE_ to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being _RARE_ at the far end of the valley
Gavin's _RARE_ , his own _RARE_ feeling , his _RARE_
thought of a time when _RARE_ horse had fallen _RARE_ in the _RARE_
had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy
even dance with her at Gavin's party
her like she was dirt
stand by like a fool and let him do it '' He remembered _RARE_ _RARE_ smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water
the night Clayton had _RARE_ them in the _RARE_ game
Gavin's son '' , Joe _RARE_ had said
to Lester
brought him back to this valley _RARE_ he would help you find your boy
to help Gavin all the time
a fool of you , Lester ''
round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy
plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place
let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back
one way they can get out now and that's through the _RARE_ -- if we ride hard we can take them ''
_RARE_ to _RARE_ shoulder
jerked away
killed Tom -- do you understand that ''
back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the _RARE_ warmth of the saloon into the cold of the _RARE_ night
through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light
_RARE_ _RARE_ were the last to leave
up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance
the cold dawn the mist _RARE_ low to the ground , then rose with a _RARE_ of sudden wind to leave the valley clear
_RARE_ and hard _RARE_ of sunlight _RARE_ down to _RARE_ the earth with _RARE_ of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses _RARE_ like dark streams over the _RARE_ snow
turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , _RARE_ out on the _RARE_ in a flat black line
of their running was cold and wild , the horses were _RARE_ and their _RARE_ _RARE_ like stiff black _RARE_ in the wind
began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's _RARE_
over his shoulder at the thin _RARE_ of _RARE_
gained nor fell back
low on the _RARE_ neck
him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the _RARE_ , no more than a mile away
was _RARE_ with excitement
not look back ; ; he could feel more than hear the _RARE_ beat of hoofs that _RARE_ out across the _RARE_ to the north
who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , _RARE_ their _RARE_ to him
were riding to kill him
was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time
over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley
_RARE_ stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again
looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him
too far , he thought
never reach California
too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of _RARE_ that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life
was not dead
, in fact , showing signs of _RARE_
been carrying an _RARE_ rifle and a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ pistol
hung in a belt _RARE_
partially _RARE_ in a _RARE_ _RARE_ and hat
these from him and _RARE_ them
Dean tied and _RARE_ the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose
him inside the building
them , _RARE_ on his feet
seeing the _RARE_ , rushed to him

talk later
we've got to get out of here ''
_RARE_ horses '' , Dean said
main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall ''
it , trying to decide whether _RARE_ was strong enough to ride
at least offered him a chance for living
none here
for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried
_RARE_ remained silent
in the orderly room across the parade ground
was on duty there
there would be men guarding the horses
dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight
was a _RARE_ so that _RARE_ would be available in an emergency
the _RARE_ rifle to _RARE_
and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said
_RARE_ the rest
with the ladies
you be ready to ride hell for leather ''
, `` If this doesn't work out , the three of you _RARE_ yourself in the house and talk terms with them ''
the _RARE_ to Dean and kept the pistol
Dean and kissed him
to him , talking to him , and _RARE_ at her eyes
away
thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had
_RARE_ weary
from Susan and took Julia _RARE_ in his arms
her also , and with deep _RARE_
began to weep
her and joined Mike
right '' , he said
said , `` Later ''
careful , _RARE_ ''
_RARE_
way you were careful ''

around in the moonlight almost naked and _RARE_ a man with a rock ''
going
no more _RARE_ scenes with her
say or do something foolish
of them would _RARE_
tell her how sorry a _RARE_ she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia _RARE_ had taken _RARE_ _RARE_ from her
him , Mike _RARE_ , as a _RARE_ to her pride
the _RARE_ to Dean and kept the pistol
well back of me '' , he said
going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas
to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close ''
pistol _RARE_ , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade
_RARE_ by a wagon gate built of two wings
stood open
through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses
_RARE_ , army style , on stable lines
spoke _RARE_
that ''
'' , Mike said
that you , Bill ''
his man
stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight
walking and got within _RARE_ reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his _RARE_ _RARE_
with the muzzle of the pistol
luck that had been running their way left him
_RARE_ _RARE_ the blow with his rifle
to _RARE_ the rifle around to fire into Mike's body
off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it _RARE_
went wide
the pistol in a savage _RARE_
it connected solidly on the man's temple , _RARE_ him
of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep _RARE_ were still rolling in the hills
horses began _RARE_ on their _RARE_
_RARE_ up
you hit ''

, but the _RARE_ in the fire ''

no chance now of all of us getting away
to try it alone ''
_RARE_ horse stood _RARE_ nearby , having been kept _RARE_ in case of need
the _RARE_ from _RARE_ hand and slashed the _RARE_ line
you go ''

''
Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse
not you ''

''
frantically
_RARE_ than me
only chance now
find these _RARE_
of us can _RARE_ up in the house and hang on until you get back
one that's taking the big chance ''
hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost _RARE_ into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand
telling how good this horse is '' , Mike _RARE_
him and save something in case you hit trouble
for _RARE_ when it comes daylight

need it
have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more
the rest of these horses so they can't _RARE_ you ''
from the saddle and gave him a mighty _RARE_ on the back
'' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again ''
was on his way at a _RARE_
down the line , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with the _RARE_
a screeching war _RARE_
off a total _RARE_
inside the stockade and _RARE_ the horses there
through the gate and joined the flight
_RARE_ away into the moonlight , heading for the _RARE_
were _RARE_ from their _RARE_ at the west end of the _RARE_
''

_RARE_ the stock ''
in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings
there
had been taken up and repeated
were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the _RARE_ horses
carrying guns they had seized up , but they were _RARE_ or hardly _RARE_ at all
Calhoun came running from the post
_RARE_ in their hands
questions that were not answered in the _RARE_
the others toward the east gate
stockade rifles began to _RARE_ as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were _RARE_
a _RARE_ to the rear of the frame buildings
beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner
was deserted
was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade
to the door and peered in
room seemed to be deserted
hung from a _RARE_ , giving light
, he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner
of _RARE_ , _RARE_ on belts , hung from a _RARE_ , along with ammunition _RARE_
case stood open , containing _RARE_ which contained powder _RARE_
a blanket from a _RARE_ in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his _RARE_
load he peered from the door
of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the _RARE_ was still clear of guerrillas
at the looming _RARE_ of the supply wagons , struck by a new _RARE_
his bundle down
lantern from its _RARE_ , he shattered its _RARE_ with a blow against a post
up the powder _RARE_ and ran out
_RARE_ , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the _RARE_ upon it
the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open _RARE_ beneath the wagon
and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house
_RARE_ beneath the wagon
was _RARE_ lighted and the guerrillas _RARE_ him
the truth
to snap past him
the muzzle of one of the rifles that _RARE_ from the shoulder pack
spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again
tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety
him heavily in the _RARE_ and he went down
racing toward him
Julia came from the door and dragged him with them
of them _RARE_ through the door into the interior and fell in a heap
to her feet and slammed the door
aside as bullets beat at the _RARE_ , _RARE_ into the _RARE_
entirely through the _RARE_ post oak
_RARE_ held , but the _RARE_ were in danger of being torn from the _RARE_
to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet
over her to shield her , for spent bullets were _RARE_ against the rear walls
from a _RARE_
only a dozen yards away , _RARE_ the house
a pistol from the heap of scattered _RARE_ and fired
a man with the first bullet
same moment _RARE_ _RARE_ fired the rifle Mike had given him and another _RARE_ was hit
the rush
scattered for cover
were burning _RARE_
had caught fire also
was spreading to the frame buildings
realized they faced a new problem
''

goes our _RARE_ an' ammunition ''
a _RARE_ line going ''



began a frantic search for _RARE_ in which to bring water from the spring
few _RARE_ they found were inadequate
them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a _RARE_ effort
were in flames
drove the guerrillas back
of the command post began to _RARE_
the wagons to the spring ''
yelled
'em right into the spring

the wagons _RARE_ a massive _RARE_ of flame
supply of powder had been touched off
and the _RARE_ were beyond saving and so were the buildings
of the fire reached through the _RARE_ in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike's wound
had torn through the flesh just above the knee , _RARE_ an ugly _RARE_ that was forming a pool of blood on the floor
had missed the bone and had passed on through
Julia _RARE_ strips from their clothing and bound the injury
the leg and found that he was able to _RARE_ around on it
it wasn't the _RARE_ that made him return to his village ''

, I don't want to go into any more explanations
_RARE_
to yourself ''
, looking worried , hurried toward us
wrong , _RARE_
seem to think so ''
found a large war party south of us
attack at dawn '' , Montero said
past the _RARE_ and walked into the center of the camp
hands as a _RARE_ he shouted , `` Fort up

large war party on their way ''
second , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ appeared struck dumb
Billy began shouting orders to round up the _RARE_ and fill the water _RARE_ and for the _RARE_ to hurry up with the meal
flew into action
was a terrible thing to do '' , I said to Oso
treated us like friends
all the time you knew the _RARE_ would be using our rifles on them
what a world you people live in ''
me an _RARE_ look
_RARE_ got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly
would you have done in _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ come up and kill you and your people , or would you _RARE_ him on someone else ''
his head
Manuel did that in the war
the British never got the _RARE_ to fight for the King
whispered in the ears of the _RARE_ that the _RARE_ were _RARE_ to _RARE_ 'em for their horses
went on to the _RARE_ and told them that the _RARE_ was goin' to move up
that with all the Nations
they were _RARE_ each other so hard they had no time for anyone else
Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero
that letter
it in a little _RARE_ made of fish skin ''
that was war '' , I said
no war on now ''
wrong , _RARE_
country there's a war on every time the grass turns green
was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites
goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land ''
being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place _RARE_
why this company's important
get over the mountains others will come along
the _RARE_ don't want us to make it
_RARE_
_RARE_ not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work
get through he'll have the _RARE_ _RARE_ for our hair and our goods
_RARE_ ain't goin' to help -- let's _RARE_ up ''
dug in behind one of the _RARE_ we were using as protection , I _RARE_ found myself _RARE_ with _RARE_ logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to _RARE_ if Old _RARE_ large party of screeching warriors had _RARE_ our company
unlike the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ are not great _RARE_ , nor are they aggressive like the savage _RARE_
an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the _RARE_
I was _RARE_ with myself for _RARE_ with _RARE_ methods
he had told the others what he had done
brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was _RARE_ by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river
think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly
the _RARE_ kill each other
we care ''
was _RARE_ bitter
was a terrible thing to do
children
Oso replied calmly , `` _RARE_ ain't easy to _RARE_ out in this country , _RARE_ ''

Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink _RARE_ _RARE_ together the hills and the sky
was in the center of a wide valley
set up a strong position , using every _RARE_ and box we had in addition to _RARE_ of _RARE_ and brush
ordered the _RARE_ brought inside the _RARE_ circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked _RARE_ the job of trying to keep them steady under fire
herd was the one _RARE_ in our defense ; ; the _RARE_ undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible
horses would make the position difficult to defend against _RARE_ warriors
had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on _RARE_ orders had _RARE_ enough bread to last the day
filled , the herd fed and _RARE_
part had been the waiting ; ; although we didn't expect the attack before dawn , the long _RARE_ night , filled with the sounds of the _RARE_ insects , seemed endless
hunting _RARE_ sounded like _RARE_ Indian _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ pony made one's skin crawl
_RARE_ , his rifle _RARE_ in his arms ; ; I didn't catch a wink
I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes _RARE_ at me with a knife
a relief when they finally came
through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , _RARE_ their _RARE_ and filling the morning with their _RARE_ _RARE_ cry
'' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes ''
be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle
your fire '' , Montero was shouting
until my shot
the first man who doesn't ''
see them in my sights
about a mile off ; ; under me the ground _RARE_ slightly
they were only feathers and dark _RARE_ faces and bodies , _RARE_ over their _RARE_ heads
emerged as men
was in the lead
was split by a _RARE_ _RARE_ , his eyes were _RARE_ of white ; ; _RARE_ red and black medicine symbols covered his chest
naked except for a _RARE_
him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions
was open , his neck _RARE_ with the strain of his _RARE_
his chest in my sights
a red circle
came nearer and nearer
, how long is he going to wait , I thought
cracked
I thought he had missed
remained erect
_RARE_ was still above his head
started to _RARE_ over , another _RARE_ swung him onto his horse
the trigger
last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony
the pony fall like a stone and the young _RARE_ flew over its head , _RARE_ like a rubber ball
to run but _RARE_ shot caught him on the wing
once in the grass and lay still
you're goin' to kill 'em --
''

he said was lost in the _RARE_ of gunfire on all sides
broke under the _RARE_ fire , _RARE_ and retreated
up

back ''
shouting
the valley I could see the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war _RARE_ , _RARE_ , blankets and wounded and dead horses
air was filled with the _RARE_ odor of _RARE_ blood , the _RARE_ _RARE_ of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder
screamed as it twisted from side to side in a _RARE_
cracked ; ; the square head fell over
the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek
_RARE_ furiously , his long black hair _RARE_ out behind him
a ragged _RARE_
dead before he hit the ground
Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em ''
furiously
for the charge
, I tell you ''
_RARE_ at the end of the valley were faint
louder as the _RARE_ charged again
see their faces _RARE_ with sweat and bear _RARE_ , their mouths open , shouting their _RARE_ _RARE_
Eyes is back , , Montero said
captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat
see the blood running down his chest
riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to _RARE_
to aim
sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger
had caught him high in the chest ; ; there was no doubt he was dying
waited for Montero
he delayed so long that some of the _RARE_ shouted frantically , but they held their fire
were only several lengths away when he fired
flung Gray Eyes from his horse
_RARE_ swept most of the other _RARE_ from their _RARE_
few reached our wall
the _RARE_ of an _RARE_ and a _RARE_ face burst apart in a _RARE_ spray
Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an _RARE_ face became shattered flesh and bone
leaped from his horse to the top of the _RARE_ , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight

up , jerked the _RARE_ from the _RARE_ and snapped his neck
were running at the _RARE_ , _RARE_ and waving blankets
got one , the _RARE_ the others
the _RARE_ _RARE_ for a moment by the _RARE_ body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position
were almost _RARE_
of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the _RARE_ charged again
more of them _RARE_ the _RARE_
Indian _RARE_ at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward _RARE_ of his rifle butt
like a man kicking a _RARE_
a dark rider was _RARE_ his pony with a quirt in an attempt to _RARE_ the _RARE_
shot killed his horse , he rolled off the _RARE_ on top of me
smell _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and oil
were dark , fluid , _RARE_ , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in
the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil
me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in _RARE_ of paint
made one last desperate charge
_RARE_ to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , _RARE_ and twisting their _RARE_ frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ efficient _RARE_
badly wounded , gripped hands in _RARE_ , knees in _RARE_ , held on as long as possible and then , weak from _RARE_ _RARE_ , slipped _RARE_ , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the _RARE_ hoofs
_RARE_ from the backs of their wounded , screaming _RARE_ to make one last _RARE_ charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts
them reached our walls again
_RARE_ _RARE_ turned away
distance we could hear the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of the death song
carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and _RARE_ from her wrist
saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger
could burn down this whole _RARE_ with a fire that size
matter to a fool like you
to me ''
right '' , Wilson said quickly
_RARE_ too big
appreciate the advice ''
losing patience again
before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company
helped him change his mind
not _RARE_ you '' , she said
telling you
too big

sure it's out when you leave in the morning ''
taken _RARE_
him a long time to _RARE_ himself
some mistake '' , he said finally
right about the fire
than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm
wrong about the rest of it
leaving in the morning
I
the place ''
her surprise by _RARE_ the reins and moving the _RARE_ around so that she could get a better look at his face
seem to tell her anything
around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and _RARE_ scattered over the ground , the two kids , the _RARE_ _RARE_ that was _RARE_ its _RARE_ just within the far reaches of the _RARE_
it for a long time
turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it
own this place ''
, and her tone had _RARE_ until it was almost friendly
bought it ''
a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said
_RARE_
know him ''
laughed

to
ran him off here six years ago ''
say anything
watching the girl , wondering what was coming next
picked up the quirt and was _RARE_ it around her wrist and smiling at him
didn't tell you that '' , she said
'' , Wilson said
it's _RARE_
the kind of thing that a man would be proud of
doesn't make any difference
me a clear title
it with me , right here

wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me
what I said about that fire
it's out when you leave

you go back to doing the dishes now ''
meant to _RARE_ him , and didn't quite _RARE_
the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now
don't mind washing dishes now and then '' , he said pleasantly
doesn't hurt
hurt you , though
mistake you for a woman ''
to say more , but he never got the chance
quick
the quirt down , _RARE_ it across his cheek , and he tried to step back
the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle
down against him , and he tried to break her fall
her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him
him a little sick , and he let go of her
up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her
the blood from his cheek

shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful _RARE_
quirt -- I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good
were a man '' -- `` She isn't , _RARE_ ''
came from behind him , and Wilson turned
had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees
moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him
tall and _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , Wilson thought
was handsome , despite the long thin scar that _RARE_ across his cheek
not a man , _RARE_ '' , he said
am
got any ideas ''
the Winchester and pointed it at _RARE_ chest
the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said
_RARE_
thought I told you to stay home ''
_RARE_ the Winchester down and rested it across his lap
looked pure white in the _RARE_ ; ; his eyes were black and _RARE_ , and _RARE_
shouldn't be riding up here after dark , _RARE_ '' , he said quietly
can take care of this
job for you ''
_RARE_ the quirt impatiently against her knee and _RARE_ at him
it without _RARE_
said go home , Joseph
no business up here ''
didn't answer this time
scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry
Wilson wonder
the _RARE_ as he turned silently
hear the _RARE_ feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out
the dust from his coat
was that ''

personal guard
hard on him ''
works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind
a friend
Joseph _RARE_
anything else you want to know ''
now '' , Wilson said
guess I'll find out soon enough
blood on your cheek


have got there when you fell against me ''
it off with the sleeve of her coat
bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said
her hand start to work down the leather _RARE_ toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist
, no '' , he said , and he was without humor now
had enough of that
enough of you
know what goes on around here , and I don't care
know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and I don't care about that , either
me by surprise
know how to handle you next time ''
up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was _RARE_
her blow and she fell , _RARE_ against the _RARE_
_RARE_ her balance and got up in the saddle
had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the _RARE_ , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before
forgotten that she was so pretty
_RARE_ was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_
known women like that , one woman in particular
had been too many
the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping
sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending
shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be _RARE_ by a woman
greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed
not to show it
a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed
to sleep '' , he said
of you
things to do than listen to something like that
down at the creek _RARE_ the dishes , if you want me ''
the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream
was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to _RARE_ it
, at any rate
a feeling that the girl meant trouble
did , he could stand it better in the light
_RARE_ at the _RARE_ and reflected on how things had turned out
when they had pulled up in front of the _RARE_ ranch house , his hopes had been high
of the pain had gone from _RARE_ death
of it
still be plenty of moments of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and guilty relief
were starting a new life
had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two _RARE_ _RARE_ , three horses
wasn't all Wilson had expected of it
and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; ; good grass , good water
the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too _RARE_ for a cow to get to it
was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead _RARE_
was a house ; ; _RARE_ perhaps , but badly in need of repairs
last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to _RARE_
had been cheap -- just the little he had left after _RARE_ burial -- and it would serve its purpose
only one place where Jake _RARE_ description had gone badly _RARE_ : the peace and quiet
started out that way
had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better
had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses
on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him
already in the wagon
going to town , and they were both excited
the team into the _RARE_ , and wished they weren't going to town at all
an uneasy feeling about it
last night , what was her name

the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember
with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him
spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less _RARE_ than _RARE_ _RARE_ had made it seem
brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so _RARE_ that cattle wouldn't stop to _RARE_
was water
an artificial _RARE_ just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen _RARE_ that _RARE_ out of the ground above the _RARE_ _RARE_
there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble
_RARE_ of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres
part of the road was _RARE_ , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley
_RARE_ once they reached the flat , and _RARE_ , but the grass was better
breeze played across it , moving it like waves
hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or _RARE_ that they might _RARE_ up from the side of the road
them an hour before they came to the first houses of _RARE_
was about what Wilson expected : one main street with its rows of _RARE_ buildings , a water tower , a few _RARE_ , a single hotel ; ; all dusty and _RARE_
was quiet
my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this ; ; under the circumstances I was only too willing to _RARE_ all
nearly thirty at the time
to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters
dark and , I sensed , very large ; ; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long _RARE_ tube suspended directly above it
was aware of people moving about in the darkness
turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded
of three of four vague figures , at the most
and there
as if waiting
glow of a cigarette
could see me but I not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me
paid them no attention
me , until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence
simply consisted in _RARE_ new men
phone rang he answered it
extended to the far edge of the counter , no further
the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him
_RARE_ his _RARE_
to me in a _RARE_ voice , an _RARE_ which quite _RARE_ his personality
his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of _RARE_ pale chest _RARE_
obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was
was not easy for him and he often slipped
of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the _RARE_ of _RARE_ I noticed how the clerk _RARE_
certain he was really a _RARE_ little man
( the cause of his _RARE_
on a _RARE_ on the wall , and _RARE_ it I could see his tie , _RARE_ , ready to be slipped over his head , a black _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ that ought never to have left his neck
_RARE_ were on the counter , and a _RARE_ of _RARE_ men's magazines
shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio _RARE_ _RARE_ on a station which broadcast only _RARE_ _RARE_ and cheap popular music
the clerk was trivial
pressing him , I learned that his job was only _RARE_ , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall
disappointment he attempted to _RARE_ what _RARE_ and _RARE_ of authority he felt might still be _RARE_ to his person
I saw him assume a _RARE_ air
saw me coming he turned his radio off
a show of _RARE_ my forms on the shelf
pick up the ringing phone with studied _RARE_ , then _RARE_ into it with _RARE_ importance
knowledge he possessed he forced upon me
mornings , I was informed , _RARE_ tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall
and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight _RARE_ through their _RARE_ , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office
out the switch to me and for a moment I _RARE_ believed that he would let _RARE_ follow words
shown , instead , a _RARE_ of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning
here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand
afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said
those tickets was of great value to its _RARE_ _RARE_
my hand
would remember what this _RARE_ little man had told me about the worth of a ticket
else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , I gave myself over to _RARE_ concerning the hall itself
lighted , what would it look like
of the two _RARE_ fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air
, upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , I had visited the toilet _RARE_ the hall
the number of _RARE_ and _RARE_ I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time
I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended
observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison
for some time been hoping , in _RARE_ , for one of the dim figures to pass between the _RARE_ _RARE_ and myself
that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , I could not tell
, I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners _RARE_ removed from the counter with its overhead light
did not _RARE_ very far back into the hall , and my eyes were _RARE_ rather than _RARE_ by the dim daylight entering through the _RARE_ _RARE_ when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or _RARE_ , on the floor below
clerk appeared to _RARE_ of my frequent curious _RARE_ back over my shoulder
would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention
had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the _RARE_ occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , _RARE_ off and on impatiently
of _RARE_ _RARE_ annoyed me
certain it was _RARE_
from a type of _RARE_ I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here
to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed
strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance
in a state of suspense because of it
not _RARE_ to my past nor did I wish to
signed it off on the forms
lay solely with the hall , yet what did I know about the hall at this point
had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning
to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing
not despair , however ; ; far from it
constantly searching for _RARE_ around the neighborhood of the hall
a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me
_RARE_ the street on which the hall _RARE_
was only a few blocks away but an _RARE_ line of _RARE_ prevented me from seeing it
noticed the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ reaching above the _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ from beyond -- _RARE_ _RARE_ , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me
, on the other hand , appeared _RARE_ and deserted on these long _RARE_ afternoons
nothing I'd ever seen before
was _RARE_ , but _RARE_ in the _RARE_ might be an indication that windows , now _RARE_ , had once looked out upon the street
_RARE_ the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall
was not a tall structure and other buildings _RARE_ it
I wandered about this neighborhood of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , truck _RARE_ and taxi repair shops , _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ lunch _RARE_ , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there
to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk
had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application
had passed well into summer
, when I put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual
asked him what , if anything , I could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall
_RARE_ this _RARE_ on any _RARE_ morning , though not before ten o'clock
impressed this upon me : that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock
went for my interview with the director I saw why
was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people
_RARE_ the floor
fans were going , drawing from the large room the _RARE_ of _RARE_ smoke which _RARE_ about in pale _RARE_ _RARE_ the ceiling
felt the draft they were making while _RARE_ the stairs
itself seemed still to be _RARE_ the heavy _RARE_ of many men
by the counter
was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office I noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open
I could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor
office
my knuckles on the counter
came to the door
at once disappointed , although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained
a man in his late _RARE_ , with _RARE_ hair , of medium height ; ; he looked _RARE_ in a _RARE_ summer suit , brown silk tie and _RARE_ soft collar
_RARE_ , _RARE_ shoes ; ; they somehow made me expect to see him _RARE_ into a _RARE_ _RARE_ routine any moment
came toward me _RARE_ enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file _RARE_ and got out my application
the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times
not look at them now
lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this _RARE_ , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the _RARE_ of the hall
, in a voice as _RARE_ as his appearance
I registered
_RARE_ , he must express his _RARE_ over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall
looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ; indeed , my _RARE_ qualifications were such that he , a college _RARE_ himself , must _RARE_ me them
sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for
of men I would come into contact with , at the hall
did not surprise me ; ; I felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and _RARE_ place
doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying
always , I said , _RARE_ after working hard with my hands
, I went on , growing _RARE_ as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual _RARE_
effect I had already _RARE_ all connections which bound me to my former existence
, hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head
him up ''
with it ''
could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the _RARE_ own gun against the _RARE_ head , hard
went over without sound , falling to the bare floor
_RARE_ , `` Why did you do that ''
at him
did you want me to do , kiss him
me in solitary twice ''
the _RARE_ man's shoulder and swung him around

looked at him
to Barton that the green eyes _RARE_ him , the _RARE_ smile held _RARE_ , but he had no time to waste now
on
''
out through the _RARE_ door , into the _RARE_ square
three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to _RARE_ , but they were in other cell blocks

later they reached the horses

in a studied voice , `` I didn't do it for you

lifted his head

not trust Rankin , his violent _RARE_ , his killer _RARE_
years in prison had taught him _RARE_
in a fight , _RARE_ in both numbers and money
all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night _RARE_ , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure
they really hoped to _RARE_ they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the _RARE_ on the other side

touched Carl _RARE_ arm and moved off , up the river bank
a careful , _RARE_ report from Dill on the conditions in the valley
on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket , passing it over silently
knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the _RARE_ of _RARE_
drew in the _RARE_ deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and _RARE_ in his throat for a moment before he _RARE_
gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly
first five years in prison , they had shared a cell
was neither a rancher nor a valley man
been the _RARE_ for the mining _RARE_ , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the _RARE_ money
done time for the theft
thing they had in common was their hatred
Donald _RARE_
drawn them together , and since his release from prison Dill had worked _RARE_ to effect this night's escape
now , `` I've got the perfect headquarters set up
_RARE_ mine ''
knew the place
before a group of _RARE_ had bought out the _RARE_ claims in the rocky hills south of _RARE_ Valley
spent a million dollars , _RARE_ in a road , putting up buildings , _RARE_ their _RARE_ tunnel
vein had _RARE_ out and the whole project had been _RARE_
_RARE_ washed badly '' , said Dill , `` but there's a trail you can get over with a horse
of _RARE_ couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail ''

do the valley people feel ''
mad as ever
men keep them off balance , and they don't trust me
_RARE_
learn you're in the hills though , they'll _RARE_ , don't worry about that ''
for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always _RARE_ in his mind
boy
find him ''
silent as if he hated to answer , and Barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension
in _RARE_ Ferry ''
in surprise
he doing there ''
hesitated
_RARE_ ''
_RARE_
''
_RARE_ has the _RARE_ bank in Cap _RARE_ saloon ''
under his breath
long pause he asked , `` How many people know who they are ''

_RARE_ saw to that
a _RARE_ , you know
out to _RARE_ men
them of everything you've ever written him
your ranch ''
up
_RARE_ , `` All right
get the boy ''
come up also
was afraid of this
didn't tell you ''
you hadn't I'd have killed you ''
tightened
you can't ride into the Ferry
they'll expect you to do
there waiting for you
how you feel about the child
The hell you do ''
was _RARE_ than Dill had ever heard it
never saw him
died in _RARE_ after I was sent away
can't leave him there
would like nothing better than to hold him as _RARE_ , and I wouldn't _RARE_ a snake to his tender care
to get the boy
''
_RARE_ men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult
over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state
Donald _RARE_ in his massive home in _RARE_
the mines at North San Juan and _RARE_
men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences
involved knew that the whole valley was a powder _RARE_ , and _RARE_ Barton the _RARE_ which could send it into _RARE_ violence
sat in his office above the _RARE_ pit
was of _RARE_ , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove
was _RARE_ by the scene outside
dozen giant _RARE_ played their _RARE_ _RARE_ of water against the huge _RARE_ of _RARE_ gravel which was the _RARE_
was the bed of an ancient river , _RARE_ in some _RARE_ _RARE_ of earth
partially _RARE_ by ages and pressure , yet it _RARE_ before the _RARE_ of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire _RARE_ , and with the gold it held washed down through the long _RARE_
_RARE_ of gold a month
tons of rock and soil and brush
ran _RARE_ hours each day
, like the swelling volume of a hundred _RARE_ could be heard for miles
like all who worked near the _RARE_ , was partly _RARE_ from the constant _RARE_ against his _RARE_
a big man , wearing a neat _RARE_ shirt against the cold _RARE_ air
in loose rolls beneath the shirt
older than _RARE_ Barton , he had _RARE_ his way up from _RARE_ in the _RARE_ to manager of the operation
proud of his _RARE_ , proud of his job , proud that Donald _RARE_ and his _RARE_ trusted him
and breathed for the mining company
could have reached his spot nor held it without being _RARE_ , and Hague had made a virtue of _RARE_ all of his life
a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room
never accustomed himself to Kodyke
was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a _RARE_ nose
always held Hague , eyes of a dead man , _RARE_ as a _RARE_ , with the fixed intensity of a _RARE_
was _RARE_ by the _RARE_ _RARE_ that was Kodyke
nothing about the man's history
appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from _RARE_
to head the _RARE_ company police
the change rooms
out the _RARE_
the _RARE_ and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco
down his uneasy dislike
open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a _RARE_
is _RARE_ Barton
out of _RARE_ last night
_RARE_ one of the guards
him back there or we want him dead ''
the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully
''
, yes
how the ranchers in the valley are
us for all their _RARE_
ago they blew up some of our _RARE_
us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them
want _RARE_ Night _RARE_ loose again ''
nodded , _RARE_ the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing
wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said
sensed any unusual _RARE_ on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it
had finished eating , _RARE_ took _RARE_ the _RARE_ under her arm -- `` so that _RARE_ _RARE_ can teach it about the _RARE_ '' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother
offered to walk , but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally _RARE_ her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` _RARE_ ''
reached their _RARE_ house , Pamela said a few _RARE_ words to _RARE_ and kissed _RARE_ lightly on the forehead , the impulse _RARE_ by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again
turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her _RARE_ destination
drove , she thought about her plan
really quite simple
, in fact , that it might even work -- although Pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance
, she thought , had cost her _RARE_ these past few days , and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her
be _RARE_ so as not to alert the _RARE_ forest
station wagon drew _RARE_ of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the _RARE_ house , Pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped
her movements were careful and _RARE_ , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ of a criminal who has plotted his _RARE_ for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime
the _RARE_ , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house
she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom
bureau lay a small , brass _RARE_ of simple design and faded _RARE_ -- an object which , Pamela believed now , had been the property of her _RARE_ , Major _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
belonged to this land and , perhaps , had _RARE_ it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him
, Pamela , were being held responsible for his _RARE_ , then hers must be the final act of _RARE_
return this symbol to the mountain , as one _RARE_ seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility _RARE_ demand annual human sacrifice
thoughtfully , she slipped the _RARE_ into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house
only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that _RARE_ , _RARE_ pool _RARE_ in its secret bosom
if _RARE_ were possible , could only be made at that sacred , _RARE_ _RARE_
there that she would have to _RARE_ her _RARE_ , beg _RARE_
was insane , Pamela thought
was all a _RARE_ conceived dream
was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never _RARE_
forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool
little of her previous journey there with _RARE_ , and she could but hope that her _RARE_ to her mission would enable her to accomplish it
was open and freely _RARE_ , extending an _RARE_ hand
was covered with soft pine _RARE_ and the slope was gentle
and _RARE_ in the trees and the sun , all _RARE_ and soft , _RARE_ her shoulders _RARE_ from time to time
not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after all
_RARE_ responded so completely to its _RARE_
had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their _RARE_ above her head as she passed
not possible , after all , that the forest was in _RARE_ with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the _RARE_ that she had _RARE_ in failing to understand this
calm and peaceful as she walked along
_RARE_ that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim _RARE_ of trees through which she occasionally passed did not _RARE_ her fear
them as signs that she was _RARE_ the _RARE_ she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her _RARE_ , _RARE_ struggle with the mountain and its _RARE_ inhabitants
too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their _RARE_ and to be taking definite steps toward _RARE_ with them
days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ; today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable
not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; ; she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal
as she walked , her steps _RARE_ from time to time , she chose to ignore that _RARE_
slope grew _RARE_ and the _RARE_ more dim , she tried not to _RARE_
upon maintaining her _RARE_ ; ; she must be poised and proud and _RARE_ in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest
took on an _RARE_ aspect
not care what sort of person _RARE_ its woods , _RARE_ at its _RARE_ or stripped the _RARE_ from its _RARE_
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , the forest was simply there -- fighting man's _RARE_ with more _RARE_ growth and man's _RARE_ with its own musical evening laughter
or white man , _RARE_ or killer , the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could _RARE_ equally well on _RARE_ and _RARE_ ; ; knowing that its _RARE_ mass would always _RARE_ the short span of time _RARE_ to any man
her head
not think about time
another one of those traps
grim pursuit of _RARE_ , Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband
when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand
he _RARE_ her need when he himself was innocent
would not _RARE_ upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the _RARE_ , _RARE_ figure of her _RARE_ _RARE_
, daylight mind would _RARE_ away such images ; ; they would not dare to face his _RARE_
glad Jim was nowhere near
would have _RARE_ with her duty
grew _RARE_ and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine _RARE_
huddled more closely together , their _RARE_ and leaves _RARE_ in a _RARE_ _RARE_ against the sun
_RARE_ _RARE_ the rocks in forming _RARE_ _RARE_ for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as _RARE_ , Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction
she continued to move upward
sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of _RARE_
had become an alien world where she _RARE_ , alone , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , to deal with whatever _RARE_ were offered
a bold , dark _RARE_ of pine _RARE_ that stood like a medieval _RARE_ , _RARE_ the sun and human time
and the same time , she was within it but still searching for the _RARE_ that would give her entry
into the forest -- a solid being that _RARE_ its hand over the _RARE_ mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees
at _RARE_ side , its presence _RARE_ close , yet too far for her to hear
in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , _RARE_ her _RARE_
over the root of a tree that _RARE_ _RARE_ above the earth
of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , _RARE_ her arm on a naked stone
moment , she could not catch her breath and then , her breath returning in short , frightened _RARE_ , she lifted herself to her feet _RARE_
to brush the dirt and _RARE_ of leaves off her clothes
_RARE_ slightly , and the _RARE_ skin cried out in pain
around
_RARE_
to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had _RARE_ been swallowed up in the _RARE_ gloom of the trees
quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her
standing in a thick grove
were crowded so closely together that their branches _RARE_ , virtually _RARE_ out the sun completely
smelled moist and _RARE_ as it might in a cave deprived of the _RARE_ effect of the _RARE_ _RARE_
the feeling that , under the _RARE_ leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly _RARE_ and giving their soil back to the mountain
made Pamela _RARE_
chill swept through the grove
breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a _RARE_ familiarity upon the deep _RARE_ of the grove , _RARE_ Pamela in a _RARE_ embrace
a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified , never actually perceived
had she felt or _RARE_ or imagined such a scene
knew this _RARE_ , _RARE_ atmosphere that was somehow _RARE_ alive
her _RARE_ hands and _RARE_ around her _RARE_
into the open neck of her _RARE_ and slid down her body , _RARE_ into her flesh through all the quivering _RARE_ of her skin
across her _RARE_ , _RARE_ the life in her _RARE_
her _RARE_ , _RARE_ with its icy _RARE_
her body with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of an _RARE_ , and its particles , spreading , _RARE_ , crawling , joined themselves into steel bands that _RARE_ her knees so tightly that they _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ her lungs so that her breath came in _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; clutched her throat and _RARE_ up the _RARE_ in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were _RARE_ together in the rigid _RARE_ of her _RARE_
to get away from here before this _RARE_ possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , _RARE_ her of reason and sight
did not know which way to go
of the trees _RARE_ her , _RARE_ every possible exit from the grove
been _RARE_ here by a _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ around her throat in _RARE_ circles
not scream , for even if a sound could take shape within her _RARE_ mouth , who would hear , who would listen
mountain listen
_RARE_
to escape
to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place
forward through the shadows and the trees that _RARE_ her and tried to _RARE_ her back
body protested , _RARE_ painfully where the blood in her _RARE_ had _RARE_ , where cold _RARE_ _RARE_ still clung and _RARE_
she made seemed _RARE_ _RARE_
loudly under her feet ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ and scratched at her slacks ; ; tree branches snapped as she pushed them _RARE_ away from her
she found exactly the right statement
it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him
want to tell you something Thomas _RARE_ Lord
aware that you've got a _RARE_ as long as my leg , and that I don't amount to anything
-- `` But it don't matter _RARE_ '' , Lord supplied _RARE_
me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the _RARE_ flower that _RARE_ ''
, he _RARE_ out his lips and attempted to kiss her
away from him furiously
shut up

something to say to you , and by God you're going to listen
hear me
to listen ''
_RARE_
he wanted very much to listen
that anything a _RARE_ little lady like her had to say would be _RARE_ important , as well as _RARE_ to the ear , and he didn't want to miss a word of it
she mind speaking a little louder
think you _RARE_ , Tom Lord
you're mean and _RARE_ and stupid , and -- louder ''


can hear you while I'm _RARE_ the car
we might be in for a _RARE_ of trouble ''
the door and got out
at the car side for a moment , looking down at her _RARE_

goin' to say _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` Maybe you could write it down for me , _RARE_
in real big letters , an' I can _RARE_ it out later ''
, go on '' , she said
go the hell on ''
, nodded , and walked around to the front of the car
_RARE_ , he stared down at its _RARE_ _RARE_ left side
_RARE_ down on the heels of his _RARE_ boots , peered into the orderly _RARE_ of _RARE_ , shock _RARE_ , and spring
_RARE_ on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination
time , he straightened again , _RARE_ the red _RARE_ dust from his hands , _RARE_ it from his _RARE_ _RARE_ and his _RARE_ , _RARE_ shirt
no gun -- a strange _RARE_ for a peace officer in this country
he'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun
really feels that way , she thought
all he's got , all he is
big pile of _RARE_ in an almost _RARE_ package
could make myself feel the same way She studied him _RARE_ , _RARE_ ; ; against the _RARE_ background of sky and _RARE_ it was easy to confirm her analysis
the _RARE_ place , the _RARE_ end of nowhere , Tom Lord looked almost _RARE_ , almost _RARE_
handsome , with his _RARE_ hair and eyes , his _RARE_ features
known plenty of _RARE_ guys , and , _RARE_ his good looks , what was there left
a big man ; ; rather on the medium side
he very powerful of build
move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more _RARE_ than truly strong
relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance
, she told herself
_RARE_ sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone
by _RARE_ , I want him and I'm going to have him
her eye , came back around the car with the _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ , _RARE_ walk
these _RARE_ still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years
in at her side , _RARE_ a cigar into his mouth , and politely _RARE_ one to her
, cut it out , Tom ''

you stop that stupid _RARE_ for even a minute ''
ain't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested
maybe you just don't feel like a cigar ''
feel like getting back to town , that's what I feel like
are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk ''
get there faster _RARE_ '' , Lord _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ as how I got a _RARE_ front spring
other hand , _RARE_ , maybe you wouldn't either
it's _RARE_ a _RARE_ walk , and I _RARE_ maybe get this spring _RARE_ up in a couple of hours ''
-- with what
out here but _RARE_ ''
, ain't it the truth ''
with secret _RARE_
a _RARE_ thing but _RARE_ , so I _RARE_ I'll get the boss _RARE_ to help me ''

sake ''
''
, cutting her off
that _RARE_ ''
it then , the distant _RARE_ of the _RARE_ -- a test well in _RARE_ country
with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there ; ; sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town
had to be prepared for almost any emergency
to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others
, let's get going '' , she said impatiently
'' -- She broke off , frowning
did you mean by that _RARE_ _RARE_
boss _RARE_ to help you ''
, I meant what I said '' , Lord declared
else would I mean , _RARE_ ''
at him , lips compressed
with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ indifference , she took a _RARE_ from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her _RARE_
mood , it was the best way to handle him ; ; that is , to show no curiosity _RARE_
she would be _RARE_ into a _RARE_ -- _RARE_ and _RARE_ until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the _RARE_ struggle of Tom Lord _RARE_ Joyce _RARE_
_RARE_ along at a _RARE_ crawl , the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ against the tire , occasionally _RARE_ against the road itself
_RARE_ as he fought the steering wheel
very pleased with himself , as though some _RARE_ scheme was working out exactly as he had planned
this _RARE_ , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension
out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his _RARE_ body were _RARE_ for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated
seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly _RARE_ occasion
the day that he had practically _RARE_ up the main street of Big _RARE_ with _RARE_ McBride , field boss for the _RARE_ _RARE_ & _RARE_ Company
been _RARE_ for _RARE_ McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line
him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his _RARE_
a _RARE_ reason for wearing it
_RARE_ for _RARE_ , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields
as long as the weapon was carried openly , the _RARE_ office had made no previous issue of it
what's this all about ''
, when Lord confronted him
the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit ''
the wrong thing to say
to do as he was told instantly -- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car -- he had played into Lord's hands
was that he had virtually had to protest
had forced him to by his manner of _RARE_ him
`` How about it ''

single me out on this permit deal ''
, I'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him
aim _RARE_ be _RARE_ , _RARE_
to bother no one unless we have to , which I _RARE_ we do , in your case
got to be _RARE_ careful with any of you _RARE_ big shots ''

had heard that there was _RARE_ money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him
an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable
, Lord '' , he said _RARE_
know you've got a _RARE_ against me , and maybe I can't blame you
that _RARE_ _RARE_ you and I helped 'em do it
all wrong , man
lawyer
do what I'm told , and '' -- `` _RARE_
could mean trouble with a _RARE_ that's _RARE_ for _RARE_
get rid of that pistol right now , _RARE_ McBride
that or take you out a permit right now ''
do either , of course
, as the deputy demanded
a _RARE_ _RARE_ of at least a few minutes
so would make his job _RARE_ impossible
were a _RARE_ lot
he _RARE_ authority over them -- make them _RARE_ the line , as he had to -- if he _RARE_ under to this _RARE_ _RARE_
get around to it a little later '' , he _RARE_ desperately
as soon as I go to the bank , and '' -- `` _RARE_
_RARE_ McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly _RARE_ hand on the field _RARE_ arm
strictly the _RARE_ game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in
he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's _RARE_ deck
off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him , _RARE_ _RARE_ him into a _RARE_
practically the last move that McBride made of his own _RARE_
him in the stomach , so hard that the _RARE_ almost pressed against his _RARE_
as he _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ him
there was a _RARE_ blow to the heart , and another _RARE_ blow to the stomach But he couldn't keep up with them
could he defend himself against them
to be fighting not one man but a dozen
could no longer think of _RARE_ , of honor , but only of escape
he's going to kill me , he thought wildly
him no harm
_RARE_ hurt to no man
just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he's going to kill me
to death in front of a hundred people
terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go _RARE_
McBride , would be _RARE_ as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go _RARE_ , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too _RARE_
into the street , flopped _RARE_ in the _RARE_ dust
fleeing the _RARE_ shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again
see ; ; he was long past the point of _RARE_ thinking
he heard laughter , _RARE_ of _RARE_ , but he could not read the _RARE_ properly
not _RARE_ that Lord had _RARE_ from the fight minutes ago , and that his _RARE_ arms were _RARE_ at nothing but the air
them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated _RARE_ world that was Lord's world
he was sure , was the way they would act ; ; laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was _RARE_ to death
would be done about it
_RARE_
his young wife , the girl who was both daughter and wife to him
like he was
by the rules , never _RARE_ , never _RARE_ or _RARE_ by circumstance
would -- When he _RARE_ consciousness he was in Lord's house , in the office of _RARE_ Lord , the _RARE_ deceased father
outfit -- known as the _RARE_ because of its brand -- reached _RARE_ _RARE_ before _RARE_
was _RARE_ and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's _RARE_
the new hands , a Mexican named _RARE_ _RARE_ and a kid known only as _RARE_ , were picked for the first trick of riding night herd
of the crew _RARE_ their _RARE_ and turned them into the _RARE_
tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the _RARE_ fire , rolled and lighted _RARE_ cigarettes , _RARE_ about
some _RARE_ talk , a _RARE_ discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive
deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the _RARE_ wife and son to join the outfit
bothered the older hands
, _RARE_ _RARE_ , had arrived there long before the herd
a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his _RARE_ wagon
_RARE_ a _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ for the Dutch _RARE_
be ready within the hour
family was setting up a separate camp nearby
_RARE_ the _RARE_ from both Tom _RARE_ and his father's wagon
gathered wood for a _RARE_ , and his wife was busy at it now
an eye on the _RARE_ and little _RARE_ , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they _RARE_ in playing
at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon
had caught up with the outfit shortly after the _RARE_ joined it , which had been at _RARE_
alone , without his wife and child
in an angry mood : _RARE_ had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him
what had taken place in town , between him and his wife
that she could talk to her mother about it
her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it
mother would _RARE_ her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern
, get out of that creek
, _RARE_
you'll get mud all over your dress ''
she called to the children , _RARE_ let her gaze seek Tom Brannon
she called him -- as the Mexican hands did
in earnest conversation with her father and the old _RARE_ , Luis Hernandez
are talking about

her that she probably would never know
she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward
tell her not to _RARE_ into _RARE_ affairs -- as though she were a little kid like _RARE_
moment , the three men were not saying much of anything
sitting on their heels , _RARE_ , over by the still empty _RARE_ wagon
_RARE_ down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him
a cigarette in his right hand
burning away , forgotten
was _RARE_ with _RARE_
Hank _RARE_ and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do
considering it _RARE_ , neither seeming to like what he planned

a little while

time to miss you

Clayton will see to that ''
after a time away from you
A year , Luis


should I wait ''
in a year , _RARE_
In a year _RARE_ like living in _RARE_ house too much to come back to me '' , Brannon said _RARE_
the boy will be too much under his influence by then
to take _RARE_ away from Clayton before I lose him altogether
in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father ''
to take him and leave his mother behind is not good ''
my place , you'd follow such advice as you give me ''

I can't answer , for I can't imagine something like this happening to me

and me , there's never any problem

silent for a little while , each looking _RARE_
Hernandez said , `` What must be , must be
with you , of course , _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ added , `` So am I , Tom ''
right '' , Brannon said , rising
ride out as soon as we've had _RARE_ ''
it so that they rode in an hour after _RARE_
for cover both darkness and a summer storm
of the _RARE_ ride they had watched a _RARE_ display of _RARE_ in the sky to the east
they'd heard the _RARE_ of thunder and then , just outside _RARE_ , they ran into rain
had _RARE_ _RARE_ them
put on old coats or _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ they carried behind their saddle _RARE_
seven of them , enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff
to be nothing more than that
to be no _RARE_
bluff failed and they ran into trouble , Brannon had told the others , they would _RARE_ -- and he would come after his son another time
want to put himself outside the law
were Hank _RARE_ , Luis Hernandez , and _RARE_ son _RARE_
brothers were also along
man was Red Hogan , a _RARE_ little _RARE_ with a wild _RARE_ and a liking for _RARE_
all good men
dark early , because of the storm
of the storm , the streets of _RARE_ were deserted
_RARE_ _RARE_ through the _RARE_
in before the town _RARE_ office , a _RARE_ building on Main Street
burned inside , but Brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty
to catch _RARE_ Macklin there
just stepped out '' , he said
to have supper
come along
of you wait here ''
Hogan , he rode to the _RARE_ _RARE_
down from the saddle and had a look inside
there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse
he's at the hotel ''
to the _RARE_ House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street
in there , Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for _RARE_ Macklin in the hotel dining room
no _RARE_
on his old brown _RARE_ coat and it was already _RARE_
felt no physical _RARE_
only vaguely aware of the _RARE_ rain
noticed the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ and the hard _RARE_ of thunder
, stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal
and climbed the steps
finished eating '' , Hogan said
with a cup of coffee now
be long ''
long , at least to Tom Brannon
Hogan waited by the door , one to either side
the third man to come out , and he came _RARE_
_RARE_ on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain
not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late
in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun
come along '' , Brannon told him
start anything you can't finish ''
, listen '' -- Macklin began
talk over at your office ''
, I _RARE_ you ''
go , _RARE_ '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm
the _RARE_ other arm
him down from the porch and through the rain to his office
five _RARE_ men followed them inside , _RARE_ the small room
was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms
at each of them in turn , Brannon last of all
remember you '' , he said
last one of you
you , Brannon '' -- `` Put your gun on the desk , _RARE_ ''
, hold on , damn it ; ; I won't '' -- Red _RARE_ patience ran out
the skirt of _RARE_ coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk
much _RARE_ around '' , he said
press your luck , _RARE_ ''
, `` Now the key to the _RARE_ , _RARE_ ''
''

for ''
you guess ''

putting you where you won't come to harm
-- the key
out ''
if I will
you've _RARE_ a law officer and '' -- They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides
laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there
took on a sudden _RARE_ , became _RARE_ with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing
out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure
, and said , `` All right
in my pocket ''
it out '' , Brannon ordered
as Macklin _RARE_ : `` Now let's go out back ''
Macklin turned to the back door
him into the rain and across to the _RARE_ stone building fifty feet to the rear
of the _RARE_ was of oak _RARE_ and _RARE_ with _RARE_ iron
secured by an _RARE_ _RARE_
again , not wanting to _RARE_ and open the door
him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in
door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building
_RARE_ threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and _RARE_ the door
to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on _RARE_ Street
_RARE_ with _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ still stood guard on the veranda , a _RARE_ , _RARE_ figure in the _RARE_ dark
to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun
try it '' , Brannon told him , _RARE_ and starting up the steps with his men following
get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you ''
past the now frightened man , entered the house
_RARE_ _RARE_ remained on the veranda to keep _RARE_ from _RARE_
followed Brannon inside
him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly _RARE_ and _RARE_ men who probably had never before _RARE_ into such a house
to it all the _RARE_ that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of _RARE_ smoke , of horses and cattle
mud on the _RARE_ floor , on the carpet
_RARE_ the _RARE_ of that room
arrival caught John Clayton and Charles _RARE_ off guard
of the anonymous notes seemed to be _RARE_
who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second
day of the _RARE_ came and passed , and the men who had _RARE_ at the _RARE_ laughed with satisfaction
with a single exception , nothing had happened to them
was an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ named William Lewis
out to his _RARE_ that morning , he'd been amazed to see the dust _RARE_ up in front of his feet
second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded
up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come
had found all of the _RARE_ and points of cover deserted
been no sign of a _RARE_ and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near
a man who had made a _RARE_ job of cow _RARE_
even _RARE_ to be _RARE_ his spread
had never been _RARE_
done his rustling openly and _RARE_ about it
received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them
cursed at them and threatened them
a man , those neighbors _RARE_ later , who didn't have a friend in the world
made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone
be ready next time ''

be _RARE_ right back ''
his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again
Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious _RARE_ shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area
nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out
let me meet up with that damned _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ''

all I ask ''
got that chance
_RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ aimed a little higher the third time
smashed directly into the center of William _RARE_ chest
against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself
shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground
was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county _RARE_ estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards
the offer Tom Horn had made at the _RARE_ Association meeting had _RARE_ out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got _RARE_ , the _RARE_ attorney , a Colonel _RARE_ , ordered that the tall stock detective be _RARE_ for questioning
some time to locate Horn
finally found in the _RARE_ _RARE_ region of _RARE_ County , two counties away
immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an _RARE_
_RARE_ was never made
Horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and _RARE_ witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in _RARE_ _RARE_ the day of the killing
_RARE_ alibi couldn't be _RARE_
had to release him
rode on to _RARE_ , threw a _RARE_ drinking _RARE_ and dropped some very strong _RARE_ among friends
center at three hundred yards , that _RARE_ said ''

shots in that _RARE_ _RARE_ he hit the ground
there's two men in this state can shoot like that ''
he denied everything
he created and _RARE_ an image of himself as a hired _RARE_
_RARE_ ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do
was soon back at work , giving his secret _RARE_ their _RARE_ worth
many _RARE_ _RARE_ were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not _RARE_ threats
_RARE_ were being _RARE_ less often , and _RARE_ and _RARE_ all over the range were standing deserted
were other _RARE_ who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal _RARE_ killing , the work of one of his neighbors
problem was by no means solved
the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still _RARE_
than a dozen miles from the _RARE_ land of the dead man lived another _RARE_ who had ignored the _RARE_ that his existence might be _RARE_ on -- a _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ named Fred Powell
was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man , Andy Ross , mentioned later
knew it , but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it -- even after them notes came , even after he'd heard about Lewis , even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times _RARE_ ''
morning of September 10 , _RARE_ , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work
was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack
team to a _RARE_ , they drove out to a _RARE_ creek about a _RARE_ off , then climbed down and began _RARE_
had just started swinging an _RARE_ at his second willow when the distant _RARE_ of a rifle sounded
around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest
man ran over to help his boss
God , I'm shot ''

collapsed and died instantly
no intention of searching for the _RARE_
the dead man onto the _RARE_ , yelled and _RARE_ at the team and got out of there fast
brought back the sheriff and several _RARE_ , and to the _RARE_ the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing
_RARE_ of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a _RARE_ of rocks that might have been the _RARE_ hiding place
no _RARE_ of either hoofs or boots
an empty _RARE_ case could be found
, Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately
, he shook his head , kept his face _RARE_ and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready
riding in for some _RARE_ _RARE_ of the liquor and professional ladies of _RARE_ , he laid claim to the killing with the vague _RARE_ he made
cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he'd _RARE_ announce
I sort o' got a corner on the market ''
'' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you _RARE_ them _RARE_
o' stood no chance with you in a plain , _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
lots of friends , then as always
he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every _RARE_ and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend
name brought more _RARE_ when it was announced in a _RARE_
'' , he explained , `` _RARE_ you was a _RARE_ _RARE_ the long rope
you be most _RARE_ of -- a _RARE_ or a _RARE_ ''
, I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree
well , it just don't seem _RARE_ somehow ''
''
_RARE_ _RARE_ stared in amazement
''
again in soft wonder
seen a lot o' things in my time
a _RARE_ once the _RARE_ had _RARE_ on an _RARE_ hill , and another time we ran across some _RARE_ they'd caught , tied _RARE_ down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was _RARE_ right out o' their _RARE_
o' _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ a cow _RARE_ up in green _RARE_ and _RARE_ the sun _RARE_ 'em and _RARE_ him to death
one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just don't think there is , and that's a _RARE_ way o' _RARE_ a man ''
first two _RARE_ , the warning notes were rarely ignored
had been learned
were plain
_RARE_ _RARE_ , Charlie _RARE_ , moved into the dead man's home , the anonymous letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice : If you don't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as _RARE_ was
the message found _RARE_ to the cabin door
, within three days
_RARE_ and _RARE_ counties , other men were doing the same
_RARE_ who'd treated the company _RARE_ as a natural _RARE_ , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with _RARE_ growing high in their yards
_RARE_ tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than _RARE_ were lying _RARE_
_RARE_ could count on a jury of his sympathetic _RARE_ to free him any longer
judge and _RARE_ were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could _RARE_ anywhere , at any time , to _RARE_ an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long _RARE_
straight years , Tom Horn _RARE_ the southern Wyoming _RARE_ , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known
possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by _RARE_ claiming every _RARE_ murder in the state
also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his _RARE_ _RARE_ him
_RARE_ was growing _RARE_ , _RARE_ was _RARE_ he received a price of $600 a man
best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about _RARE_ , very good money in an era when top hands worked for _RARE_ and found
had it he slipped two small rocks under each _RARE_ head as a sort of _RARE_
detailed search of old _RARE_ reports fails to _RARE_ this in the slightest
thing was certain -- his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary
fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling _RARE_ out of the _RARE_ _RARE_ country in a single week
_RARE_ my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more than once
couldn't _RARE_ that it might be his _RARE_ in the end
made himself the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ to the _RARE_
the _RARE_ who had been facing _RARE_ from rustling losses and to the _RARE_ who had been faced with _RARE_ a few years earlier , he was becoming a _RARE_ different type of _RARE_ figure
as _RARE_ and Clay and the _RARE_ brothers carried him on their books as a _RARE_ even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown
their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their _RARE_
cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of _RARE_ he was when he entered and invariably won the local _RARE_
and their _RARE_ saw him as a _RARE_ _RARE_ of the range , _RARE_ a _RARE_ _RARE_ against a _RARE_ new society that was threatening a beloved way of life
, _RARE_ _RARE_ of the cattle _RARE_ made up songs about him
, rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming
minutes had passed and Curt hadn't emerged from the _RARE_ stable , Brenner _RARE_ the hotel and faced Summers across the counter
have a little job for you , Charlie
you won't mind doing me a small favor ''
was oily , but Summers wasn't _RARE_
his lips _RARE_
is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner ''
_RARE_
very simple
want you to take a message to _RARE_ _RARE_
to come here to the hotel ''
, Summers nodded and started toward the door
thing , Summers '' , Brenner said
not to mention my name
Curt Adams wants to see her ''
up short , and turned around
don't know , Mr. Brenner '' , he said _RARE_ , beginning to get an _RARE_ of _RARE_ plans
doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that
just '' -- His voice trailed off into silence
to smile , but his eyes were cold
and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed
know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully
_RARE_ ought to have a fire company
were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a _RARE_ ''
toward the _RARE_ , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to _RARE_ room , that Adams is in trouble
to hurry ''
sir ''
pale , Summers headed for the street
to the _RARE_ stable had been merely a _RARE_ in case anyone should be watching
only long enough to _RARE_ that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside
that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that _RARE_ information had been wrong , but Curt didn't interpret it this way
like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed
horse would be close to where he was hiding
back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street
the place _RARE_ , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees
a light in Black's front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior
the house and located a barn out back
hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else
no lock on the door , only an iron _RARE_ which he _RARE_
the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him
stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ _RARE_ on a plank floor
ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden _RARE_
was very strong , and he could hear the _RARE_ of grain being ground between strong _RARE_
a match in his pocket and lit it
two horses in the barn , a _RARE_ _RARE_ and Jess _RARE_ buckskin
out the match
certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was _RARE_ Black
to get Jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as _RARE_ a person as the store owner
the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved
the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the _RARE_
animal let out a _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ around in the stall
had hoped , the house door _RARE_ open
the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall
over beside the door and waited
heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess's _RARE_ _RARE_
swung open , and Jess said _RARE_ , `` What the _RARE_ the matter with you
horse continued to _RARE_
that any animal belonging to Jess would find much _RARE_ in its _RARE_ voice
again , and entered the barn
_RARE_ , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop
crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer
you try anything '' , he said
what happened to _RARE_ ''
his breath in surprise
to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it
the stuff '' , Curt said
hold it that way ''
out to pull the door shut and _RARE_ it with a sliding _RARE_
and I have a little talking to do , Jess
be _RARE_ this ''
up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster
you , Adams '' -- Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock
ain't got nothing to talk about
don't come back in the house , _RARE_ going to '' -- `` Your _RARE_ brother isn't in the house
he's probably having supper
ride the four of you took _RARE_ given him a good appetite
around so I can see your face ''

raw fury in his eyes , and the _RARE_ of his neck were swollen
about as dumb as they come , Adams
know what you're up to , but when Brenner '' -- `` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said
Ben _RARE_ we're going to talk about ''
''

don't know _RARE_ about him ''

you don't know anything about a piece of _RARE_ , either ; ; one with blood all over it , _RARE_ blood ''
put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun
help me , _RARE_ , I'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I'm going to hear you admit killing him
talking
you to do it
Dutch Brenner ''
holding Jess's gun in his left hand
back his arm to _RARE_ the _RARE_ across Jess's face , but didn't finish the motion
_RARE_ man might come easy to someone like Jess , but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it
this , and _RARE_ that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold
all the guns makes you a big man , don't it , Adams
was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough ''
''
out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster
a step and _RARE_ his own
right , _RARE_ ; ; we're on even terms
''
out on Jess's _RARE_ face
of his right hand twisted into a _RARE_ , but he didn't reach for the gun
angry enough to be a little _RARE_ , raised his hands shoulder high
this make it any easier , _RARE_ ''
ain't _RARE_ against you '' , Jess said _RARE_
heard how you _RARE_ _RARE_
a _RARE_ ''

kind of bastard who _RARE_ up on a man from behind and _RARE_ him with a club
wanted to hear you say so ''
at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides
found Curt's weakness , or what to Jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it
the distance , a woman screamed
too involved in his own problems to pay much attention
to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before _RARE_ Black got curious and came to _RARE_
he lifted Jess's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin
his own beside it
do it another way , then '' , he said _RARE_
features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist
roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack
to duck beneath the man's _RARE_ fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess's _RARE_
like _RARE_ a _RARE_ of salt
up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit
into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a _RARE_ right which sent him spinning
lower and it would have knocked him out
was , his vision _RARE_ and for a moment he was unable to move
eyes began to focus , he saw Jess _RARE_ at him with a _RARE_
to one side , and the _RARE_ of the fork bit into the floor
a few seconds trying to _RARE_ them loose
Curt time to _RARE_ to his feet
broke off under Jess's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out
was hurried ; ; so the _RARE_ _RARE_ over Curt's head
Curt was seeing clearly again
inside Jess's guard and landed two _RARE_ to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them
Jess double over
head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and _RARE_ him head first into the wall
shook , setting the lantern to _RARE_ , and the buckskin to _RARE_ again
old _RARE_ began to _RARE_ , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess
on out there ''
seem too sure himself
_RARE_ to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall
him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor
had enough
from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , _RARE_ over his own feet in his frantic _RARE_ to get away from Curt's fists
in almost as bad shape , but he wouldn't quit
Jess into a corner , grabbed a _RARE_ of the man's _RARE_ , and drew back his right fist
me about _RARE_
him , didn't you ''
was _RARE_ idea '' , Jess _RARE_ , _RARE_ at his nose
found out about you and _RARE_ talking
to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble ''
mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' , Curt said
go of the shirt , and Jess slumped to the floor
back , Curt crossed to the stall , reached over to _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ rope , and waved his hand in the _RARE_ face
_RARE_ out of the stall
in and picked up his gun
loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster
where it lay , he left the stall
up , _RARE_
_RARE_ ''
got to his feet as someone _RARE_ the door
in there ''

the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn

to let him tell it to somebody else ''
Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess
out of here
along _RARE_ , or I'll put a bullet in your leg ''
through the door
, reaching behind him to shut the door and _RARE_ it

as we send them on their way and make camp , let's you and me go for a walk down by the _RARE_ -- all by ourselves ''

words recalled Dan to his lack of _RARE_ for _RARE_
_RARE_ he was , _RARE_ with dirt and sweat and blood , _RARE_ as a pig and naked as an Indian , _RARE_ the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , and absolutely the _RARE_ girl in this whole wonderful world

hear Clayton Burnside and _RARE_ Jackson _RARE_ up their final _RARE_ for _RARE_ on the oxen
doing most of the talking
as _RARE_ _RARE_ was coming out best on the _RARE_ , Dan didn't feel the need of putting in his _RARE_ worth
the _RARE_ moved on , he'd lead _RARE_ down by the river ; ; there he could _RARE_ and _RARE_ himself up for the evening
, he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve
hadn't got _RARE_ stopped when I did , my _RARE_ all be shot _RARE_ to hell
, picked up his ruined hat , and _RARE_ his lips thoughtfully
way the wound in his head was _RARE_ , Dan knew that it would _RARE_

in close , jerked the handsome , _RARE_ _RARE_ hat from _RARE_ head and clamped it on his own
a present for you '' , he said , _RARE_ his _RARE_ hat down over _RARE_ _RARE_ forehead
and _RARE_ trading hats _RARE_ you'll have something permanent to remember me by ''
her _RARE_ to stand beside Dan
hand in his , they silently watched the _RARE_ make the bend in the road and _RARE_ from sight
they had to look forward to , they didn't _RARE_ a moment of the time they spent seeing them go
Matilda could not believe her own eyes
spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and _RARE_ to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but _RARE_
she could see him , looking _RARE_ handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their _RARE_ wagon
waiting there at the foot of _RARE_ Rock was so _RARE_ that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all
with a _RARE_ that almost wiped out the deep , downward _RARE_ in her _RARE_ face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was _RARE_ along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` Pa

see Dan
with the _RARE_ ''
about _RARE_ ''
, who still believed they'd have them to _RARE_
ain't even in sight ''

Hez could see for himself , and so could the others
were all shouting _RARE_ , _RARE_ smiles , and _RARE_ to think that they were all back together again
a _RARE_ as _RARE_ as this one did not make a break in the _RARE_ of the day
they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , _RARE_ the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires
and only then , with the _RARE_ and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the _RARE_ take time to catch up on the news
did they hear of _RARE_ injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action
in his _RARE_ was examined , pronounced _RARE_ , and well _RARE_ with _RARE_ , before they _RARE_ up the _RARE_
on , in keeping with the _RARE_ they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to _RARE_ their food
, in spite of her _RARE_ and obvious welcome , followed the old _RARE_ of `` _RARE_ the _RARE_ when wearing the _RARE_ ''
supper , the evening turned into a regular `` _RARE_ ''
they carefully substituted old country folk _RARE_ for the Virginia _RARE_ and square _RARE_ that were so popular among more _RARE_ _RARE_ in the great _RARE_ _RARE_
Bill _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , and Gran _RARE_ _RARE_ shouting `` _RARE_ Be '' and `` _RARE_ '' above their _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ old _RARE_ , they played their _RARE_ folk games with all the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of a real _RARE_
'' , Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he _RARE_ stood by her side among the _RARE_ _RARE_ , `` don't that _RARE_ make you wish the Bible didn't say us _RARE_ can't dance ''
_RARE_ , neither '' , she replied
that it matters to me , being this far along ''
her a warm _RARE_ on the shoulder before he replied
spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling _RARE_ again too , _RARE_ ''
words of sympathy and understanding , Harmony said _RARE_ , `` I don't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games ''
his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , `` I ain't much of a hand for _RARE_ and _RARE_ , but I'd sure like to get in on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ ''
down at his big hands and slowly _RARE_ his long fingers
_RARE_ there's nobody out there , _RARE_ maybe Dan , who can _RARE_ me , Harmony ''
on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they _RARE_ out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the _RARE_ box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her _RARE_ legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally
was deeply _RARE_ that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , _RARE_ circle , _RARE_ and singing , `` _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ , the farmer in the _RARE_ ''
sight of _RARE_ happy face and _RARE_ expression , _RARE_ dark , brooding eyes quickly _RARE_ with _RARE_ tears
glad , completely and _RARE_ glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan
really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod
couldn't , not yet
the memory of her folks and the lost _RARE_ still holding her close
the center of the circle the farmer , who was Dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , `` The farmer choose his wife ''
swift _RARE_ of his big arms , he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her _RARE_ before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they _RARE_ chose the rest of their `` outfit ''
child , the dog , the cat and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle
Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were _RARE_ and resting , or else _RARE_ off from the games by the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the great cliff towering above them
how many _RARE_ rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal
names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this _RARE_
few _RARE_ folk from their own train were _RARE_ _RARE_ away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier _RARE_
saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them
were they through and the guards _RARE_ , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep
, it was the first she had known in many a night
knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first _RARE_ , _RARE_ sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into _RARE_ Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains
, they moved on again
_RARE_ _RARE_ ''
exclaimed , watching their _RARE_ muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load
body would swear I _RARE_ right up here on a cloud ''
Dan released their holds on the arms of her _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ embarrassed _RARE_
, Gran '' , they said almost in _RARE_
wasn't nothing at all ''
in her chair , Gran _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ face
Sally like _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ little _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ him , Gran '' , Rod protested
ain't _RARE_ him ''
again at the _RARE_ blond _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ upper lip
_RARE_ , I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon ''
tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold _RARE_ and water _RARE_ , placed the _RARE_ pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice
worse , Pa ''
Hez , who had _RARE_ back from his team to hold the _RARE_ chair _RARE_ in place while his boys swung up the _RARE_ and tied it tight at the ends
right _RARE_ stiff as a board this morning '' , he replied
the _RARE_ _RARE_ it _RARE_ me _RARE_ we _RARE_ to rolling ''
men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain _RARE_ signal
up at the high face of _RARE_ Rock , official _RARE_ for the _RARE_ River _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , `` Seems funny that them _RARE_ never took time to leave their _RARE_ up _RARE_ ''
what made them hurry so '' , Rod _RARE_ , giving Dan a _RARE_ wink
, and changed the subject
now on , Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and _RARE_ outfit ''
no sense you eating our dust '' , Rod protested
and her _RARE_ want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along '' , Dan explained
_RARE_ his _RARE_ , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up
the _RARE_ running gear in the train now
_RARE_ no _RARE_ right for me to follow with my black oxen , _RARE_ I can _RARE_ and pull up fast if either of you get in a _RARE_ ''
signal shot sent the men _RARE_ to their waiting teams
_RARE_ right , Dan '' , Hez called back over his shoulder
shore be _RARE_ _RARE_ both on the pull out o' the canyon ''
_RARE_ ahead at the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
double teams _RARE_ up the mountain , Harmony '' , he spoke _RARE_ , concerned by the _RARE_ look around her mouth
enough we'll all be up on top by _RARE_ ''
the corner of his eye , he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn
had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin _RARE_ backs
larger than Dutch _RARE_ , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far _RARE_ and more _RARE_
the streets and freight _RARE_ and teams were moving about
were forced to maintain a _RARE_ watch , this activity _RARE_ them to ride in and rack their _RARE_ without any particular attention being paid them
be _RARE_ forth in some bar if he's here at all '' , Cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs
no less than six or seven _RARE_ in _RARE_ , not counting the lower class _RARE_ , all _RARE_ for the trade of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
nodded
one side of the street , and I'll take the other '' , he proposed
you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in ''
was tight
do the same
I ask , Stevens ''
they took different sides of the main drag and _RARE_ _RARE_ the bars
two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero
seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually , even were he to prove the _RARE_
out of the _RARE_ _RARE_ with his hopes _RARE_ , and headed _RARE_ for the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street
was an elaborate establishment , built practically on _RARE_ in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch
_RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ dive clung like a _RARE_ nest to the rocky ribs of the _RARE_
up the steps quickly to the plank porch
windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and _RARE_ an unusually good view of the interior
the _RARE_ , Cobb glanced _RARE_ through the nearest window , and suddenly _RARE_ aside
as a _RARE_ , he paused to gather his _RARE_
expectation , Carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the _RARE_ and already so _RARE_ that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him
_RARE_ through Russ
down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious _RARE_ on the spot
porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he _RARE_ scanned the busy street below
nowhere in sight
_RARE_ , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down
had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared
luck , Cobb ''
swiftly
upward
there '' , he got out _RARE_ , _RARE_ his rising excitement
_RARE_ belt around , Pat glanced upward briefly at the _RARE_ and started that way with Cobb at his side
steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door
through first
him _RARE_ , Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside
_RARE_
minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy _RARE_ , with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as _RARE_ and dull as the day before _RARE_
was nowhere to be seen
knocked the _RARE_ ball about _RARE_ in its track , and another _RARE_ at one of the card tables
murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the _RARE_ bartender absently polished a glass
_RARE_ over , Stevens started _RARE_ for the rear of the place
_RARE_ goin' ''
the _RARE_
Pat turned to survey him deliberately
not reply , going on toward the back
than the tall , _RARE_ man in the lead , Cobb followed _RARE_ , a hand on his gun butt
measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it
no more
opened in back of the bar , running toward an _RARE_
into it
, probably for cards , opened off on either side
doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder
was locked
kick made it spring open , _RARE_
Gyp Carmer _RARE_ forward , a _RARE_ bottle _RARE_ as if to strike
through to bat it _RARE_ aside
_RARE_ Carmer _RARE_ at him
was more than _RARE_ , and his _RARE_ were _RARE_
a single powerful _RARE_ that sent Gyp _RARE_ wildly and _RARE_ down with a _RARE_ _RARE_
to struggle up , _RARE_ desperately
him a _RARE_ thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach
Cobb _RARE_ a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him _RARE_
, Stevens
his _RARE_ '' , he snapped
through his pockets , will you
have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of ''
, Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing
this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope _RARE_ by the moment
_RARE_ over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and _RARE_ toward _RARE_ hat , which had tumbled _RARE_ feet away when he first fell
it
, his eyes _RARE_ , he held out the _RARE_ _RARE_
at this ''
crown , _RARE_ behind the stained _RARE_ , could be seen thin , _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_
_RARE_ for his _RARE_ had been found
_RARE_ , Stevens
right '' , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of _RARE_ hat
is , if we can be sure this is _RARE_ money '' -- Pat grunted
else would he get it
you've got there , Cobb
soon tell ''
through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any _RARE_ would come by _RARE_

within a hundred of what _RARE_ had '' , he declared
know Penny spent some -- and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on ''
money over , Russ wiped his hands on his _RARE_ as if _RARE_ himself of something _RARE_
at Gyp Carmer was _RARE_
we get out of here ''
card room , they moved back through the _RARE_ the way they had come
met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to _RARE_ them
the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his _RARE_ warning and stepped out
Cobb _RARE_ down the high steps to the street
till they reached their horses
there , looking across at the young fellow
a pleasure for you to return this money to _RARE_ and tell him about it , Russ ''
to return it
faint surprise Russ held up his hand
me '' , he ruled _RARE_
enough
you that _RARE_ it down anyway , Stevens '' , he _RARE_ strictly
_RARE_ along home ''
you say ''
into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his _RARE_ _RARE_
owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed _RARE_
_RARE_ wasn't '' , _RARE_ Cobb _RARE_
know when you tell him
want this to sink in _RARE_
next time he won't be so quick on the trigger ''
had never _RARE_ to give advice in such affairs
the doctor '' , he returned with a smile
I still think _RARE_ an awful nice girl , Russ '' -- `` You don't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb
other a dark look , he _RARE_ his _RARE_ around and _RARE_ down off the street
him go , following more _RARE_
first restaurant he _RARE_ pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the _RARE_ for _RARE_
was , the _RARE_ was both _RARE_ and _RARE_ by his own mixed luck
always glad to see me over there '' , he _RARE_ _RARE_
he not visited the girl at _RARE_ Buck he would never have been involved in this latest _RARE_
above that , however , was his growing suspicion of _RARE_ _RARE_ part in recent events
Carmer couldn't have known about _RARE_ money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him ''
himself
the second time War _RARE_ hands made a play for that money
of an accident could that be ''
, he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun
no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ; but on the range gunfire had a meaning
, Russ listened carefully
later it came again -- a double explosion , followed by a third , _RARE_ more distant
as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the _RARE_ ranch house
up in a _RARE_
as he knew , only his father could be there
it mean
to the _RARE_ he set off at a sharp _RARE_ , with growing alarm
glimpse of the ranch house across the _RARE_ _RARE_ told him nothing
_RARE_ away , the fresh _RARE_ of guns only served to increase his speed
course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee _RARE_ past close to his face
was followed by a second , _RARE_ even closer , Cobb _RARE_ sharply aside into a depression
now what he was up against
out there hiding in the _RARE_ cover was _RARE_ the _RARE_ house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight
for having _RARE_ out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , Russ drew his _RARE_ and examined it briefly
wondered whether the _RARE_ would allow him to pull away _RARE_ , he had his answer a moment later
this way
gone far ''
cry _RARE_ to him across the brush
cracked more loudly , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ from the brush off at one side
_RARE_ had his position figured pretty close
Russ looked about hastily
west this depression led toward a draw
pony , he hurried that way , not _RARE_ till he was well below the level of the surrounding range
then , and _RARE_ forward over the horn , he urged his _RARE_ down the _RARE_ draw
not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind
been _RARE_ , and his _RARE_ _RARE_ shot after shot
or two went wild before Cobb felt something _RARE_ at his foot
had torn half of his _RARE_ away
_RARE_ his _RARE_ , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm
close overhead
_RARE_
out of here ''
first shot Russ had _RARE_ his _RARE_ to the left toward the side of the winding draw
minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless
look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment
_RARE_ from behind him , but he could make out no words
_RARE_ for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it
the _RARE_ _RARE_ into an _RARE_ draw , he plunged forward with _RARE_ speed
wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range
must chance it
out of the _RARE_ wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about
November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions
_RARE_ put its first marks on the combat record
that could fly was sent into the air
eight ships and went south across the _RARE_ and along the north coast of _RARE_ to _RARE_
enemy flew or _RARE_ was his target
eight was to patrol the _RARE_ Gulf area , with his main task to get any _RARE_ before they got to the ships
took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around _RARE_ on the east coast of _RARE_
carried two _RARE_ pound _RARE_
_RARE_ took Greg , Todman , _RARE_ , _RARE_ Ferguson , and _RARE_ and the others the two miles from the _RARE_ area to the strip
a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes
had much to say
_RARE_ down at them
a feeling that this mission would be _RARE_ like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever
dropped them off at the various _RARE_ spread through the jungle
Greg's _RARE_ from him with a _RARE_ motion and almost ran to the plane with it
was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot
into the _RARE_ feeling as if he had never been in one before
hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the _RARE_ procedure
got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ harness over Greg's shoulders
this goddamn climate
_RARE_ not airplanes ''
make out
worry , chief '' , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it

'' , Donovan said as he jumped off the wing
was his _RARE_ , his open _RARE_ to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return
_RARE_ time , Greg started the engine and _RARE_ out
time the _RARE_ were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip
where the _RARE_ had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission
before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every _RARE_ in the sky
down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him
brown _RARE_ hanging under each wing looked large and powerful
heads looked _RARE_ small
tower gave him immediate _RARE_ permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan
was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off _RARE_ he saw the clouds were dropping down again
west , the dark green hills of _RARE_ were lost in the clouds about halfway up their _RARE_
the sea was a dark and _RARE_ gray
against his _RARE_ as he led the flight in and out of _RARE_
strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it
the _RARE_ _RARE_ horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory
in the warm _RARE_
was solid above him
as he could see there was no hole to climb through it
have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated _RARE_ from _RARE_ and hope that it didn't close in before they returned
the radio _RARE_ on his throttle
, let's try to go under this stuff
close and we'll go up the valley ''
, _RARE_ '' , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg
the formation wide around three _RARE_ attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf
down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of _RARE_ , and _RARE_ into the opening that showed against the mountain
was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed _RARE_ turn
only a _RARE_ flight , but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of _RARE_
stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the _RARE_ _RARE_ seemed about to close in
other _RARE_ were worried , they did not show it
remained perfect
sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out
the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast
drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity
thought he had spotted a tank and went down to _RARE_ while Greg covered him
beat us to it ''
over the radio as he came back up in formation
to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet
_RARE_
were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights
once that he identified the somewhat _RARE_ voice of _RARE_ claiming a kill
area remained as _RARE_ as a Florida dawn
as time began to run out , he headed into _RARE_ and _RARE_ a group of houses that _RARE_ had thought might contain Japanese supplies
clouds made _RARE_ difficult
not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run
was _RARE_
Greg's _RARE_ hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it
of the flight _RARE_ a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle
load of _RARE_ gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily
up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home
it was still open
man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley
about to make a gas check on his flight when _RARE_ voice broke in : `` _RARE_

level ''
_RARE_ up from his instrument panel
them , _RARE_ against the gray , but closing fast
headed straight for each other on a _RARE_ course
enemy
old question
a few seconds to answer it
''
excitedly , and _RARE_
he thought Todman might be right
_RARE_ through the mental pictures he had from the hours of _RARE_ _RARE_
the shape down to two : either a _RARE_ or a U. S. Navy type aircraft
were the enemy , _RARE_ his position was correct
were strong on _RARE_ , American on speed and _RARE_
maximum _RARE_ , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to _RARE_ his advantages
also made him _RARE_ to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn't been spotted already
closing aircraft showed no sign of _RARE_ from their original course
, Greg made his decision
the radio _RARE_
Blue , hit the deck
throttle
you take the one on the left
the middle
the one on the right
_RARE_
sure first ''
the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` _RARE_ ''
, light with most of the gas burned out , responded _RARE_
indicator was over _RARE_ when he leveled off just above the trees
aircraft continued to come on
to be the enemy
the Air Corps had continued to _RARE_ planes
, of course , no way for the other planes to get by them
a box
could turn and escape to the east
the radio _RARE_ again
, drop your second element back
of us miss , they can pick up the pieces
make sure they're _RARE_ ''
he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy
were _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ were showing up , slightly _RARE_ _RARE_ in the gray gloom
his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight
with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the _RARE_ glass in front of him
shook
your guns , _RARE_ ''
_RARE_
'' , came a _RARE_ voice
to _RARE_ Blue
only

your _RARE_ in this canyon
order ''
the flights over against one wall
them all a chance to make a _RARE_ climbing turn attack and a _RARE_ that would not take them into the overcast or force a _RARE_ recovery
turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out
of an _RARE_ for a barrel roll , but it could be done
his throttle to the fire wall and _RARE_ up the _RARE_ , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting
_RARE_ enemy continued on as if no one else were around
haven't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise
haven't seen us ''
the radio _RARE_
, _RARE_ , now
'em home ''
back on the stick and felt his cheeks _RARE_
the corner of his eye , he watched his _RARE_ move out a bit and shoot up with him
he thought
rapid rate of _RARE_ , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done
shooting at a duck while _RARE_ a _RARE_ from a _RARE_ board
his turn
up
going to be dangerous
in this small box
dear God , make my _RARE_ good , he prayed
a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the _RARE_ in his circular sight and then added another
did not _RARE_
not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted


closed on the stick trigger
_RARE_ and slowed
lines _RARE_ their way into the gray and vanished
drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them
his turn until the plane _RARE_
with him
held for a second on the engine section of the plane
_RARE_ flew off in pieces
piece of engine _RARE_ vanished
all Greg had time to see
for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost _RARE_ and heading up into the clouds
was dropping rapidly
spun out now , he would join his _RARE_ on the ground
stay clear , he prayed
stick and _RARE_ and entered the overcast on his back
the panic of _RARE_
no idea which was up and which was down
the controls where they had been
out over him and he felt the slick between his _RARE_ and the stick grip
speed dropped until he thought he would _RARE_ out
rattling of _RARE_ , humming of tires and _RARE_ of _RARE_ there was a charming melody of _RARE_ and tiny _RARE_
moving slowly through the open or _RARE_ side windows _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and occasionally a faint _RARE_ of perfume _RARE_ from the back seat
'' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone I once more repeated the _RARE_ , _RARE_ all my _RARE_ powers of _RARE_ to sound convinced
coming to an intersection , turning right , _RARE_ to a stop
realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road _RARE_ and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican : _RARE_ , New Mexico

, I said , _RARE_ my Spanish vocabulary on my host and _RARE_ one of a _RARE_ store of smiles with my _RARE_ _RARE_
with discretion and _RARE_ to the vague golden faces _RARE_ through rising dust and the _RARE_ of the back window glass
saw the father's head slightly turn ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ shapes replaced the _RARE_ _RARE_ of gold
past
_RARE_ drivers stared _RARE_ toward the eastern horizon and past my _RARE_ and _RARE_ gaze
_RARE_ _RARE_ horn _RARE_ , and , _RARE_ _RARE_ , I saw _RARE_ in _RARE_ flash : red lips , _RARE_ silk of blonde hair and -- _RARE_ , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair -- the _RARE_ face of old _RARE_
'' , he _RARE_ , his white teeth _RARE_ _RARE_ those of the _RARE_ blonde
_RARE_ _RARE_ of a jump seat piled high with luggage _RARE_ black _RARE_ was just _RARE_ , near , or _RARE_ near that spot where -- hidden -- more _RARE_ , most _RARE_ _RARE_ hair must still be _RARE_ back in cool , oh cool wind _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ and _RARE_ flowers and engine _RARE_
luck
have _RARE_ my romantic chances rather than leave a friend _RARE_ and dusty and -- Well , at least I wouldn't have shouted back a _RARE_
anger I _RARE_ _RARE_ a car that was slowly approaching , its _RARE_ _RARE_ nearly _RARE_ me
stopping
I straightened up with my _RARE_ bag , I heard : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ , meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck ''
was that of Johnson , tail _RARE_ off another crew
look between Johnson's fat _RARE_ and the car frame a handsome and still _RARE_ lady inquired `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''

one _RARE_ '' , Mrs. Roebuck continued
_RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ , an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_
Johnson has _RARE_ said it _RARE_ make no _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew
I knew will shortly become apparent
pass over the trip to _RARE_ _RARE_ with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck `` _RARE_ if the _RARE_ speed limit '' ( 35 _RARE_ ) `` is still in _RARE_ ''
up on the _RARE_ , only to gradually reach again the 60 _RARE_ which would , I hoped , _RARE_ _RARE_ and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I , Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to _RARE_ on _RARE_ Johnson the _RARE_ _RARE_ she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ `` _RARE_ my buying us all a nice cold _RARE_ , _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ and began suddenly to go on about her son , who was `` _RARE_ a little _RARE_ than you _RARE_ ''
would have believed she had a son that age
thought Johnson was a `` sweet _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , but her _RARE_ was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it
_RARE_ he left _RARE_ his _RARE_ we _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ on the _RARE_ , Major Roebuck an Ah , an _RARE_ says ' May Ah _RARE_ one too '
_RARE_ an -- an _RARE_ , an Ah says ' _RARE_ _RARE_ you _RARE_ ' , but he says ' _RARE_ _RARE_ , you _RARE_ _RARE_ one '
_RARE_ _RARE_ him an so Ah said ' _RARE_ right , Ah _RARE_ , an his _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ one _RARE_ an _RARE_ _RARE_ was gone , the _RARE_ laughed an _RARE_ me _RARE_ he an the _RARE_ had been _RARE_ an occasional drink _RARE_ _RARE_ a yeah , _RARE_ an occasional one , but just the same it was _RARE_ _RARE_ back , an Ah _RARE_ think _RARE_ _RARE_ at all , _RARE_ ''
, I don't '' , Johnson said
a good _RARE_ , and drinking '' Mrs. Roebuck very _RARE_ let me drive through _RARE_ _RARE_ to a road which would , she said , lead us to _RARE_ and then _RARE_ and `` _RARE_ '' out of New Mexico
her `` _RARE_ '' passed into the _RARE_ where I was _RARE_ _RARE_ material for some vaguely dreamed _RARE_ , and how the word would _RARE_

Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a _RARE_ _RARE_ truck , father or _RARE_ of _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' Ford _RARE_ , came screeching to a _RARE_ stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by _RARE_ of what had once been the side window
in , _RARE_
''
, black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back
the right hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely _RARE_ _RARE_ of glass , and Johnson _RARE_ himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer
back , buddy '' , the driver said to me
carefully _RARE_ my _RARE_ bag over the low _RARE_ , I stepped on the running board ; ; it flopped down , sprang back up and _RARE_ my _RARE_
was _RARE_ forward
the rack and made a _RARE_ _RARE_ just in time , one of my knees _RARE_ landing on my _RARE_ bag -- and merely _RARE_ my camera , I was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the _RARE_ truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report
again in motion and at a speed which _RARE_ the _RARE_ similarity to _RARE_ _RARE_ Ford _RARE_
would beat old _RARE_ to _RARE_ after all
that might offer
my leg
back , drawing back my foot for a kick
was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken _RARE_ , which half covered the truck _RARE_ _RARE_ rear window
his red rubber lips were stretched across his _RARE_ little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear
beer ''
, yes '' , I roared back between dusty lips
want a beer
_RARE_ want _RARE_
, _RARE_
, I _RARE_ , my first long _RARE_ filling me with confidence and immediately _RARE_ the size of my Spanish vocabulary
my ears were _RARE_ by a flow of what I took to be Spanish , but -- the _RARE_ white teeth _RARE_ at me , the road wildly _RARE_ beyond his _RARE_ hair , beyond his _RARE_ bottle -- it could have been the _RARE_ _RARE_ English I was half hearing ; ; I wouldn't have known the difference
trying to _RARE_ the wheel , though the _RARE_ of the truck was throwing him away from it
suddenly _RARE_ , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear
off the road , _RARE_ barbed wire pulling taut
just as the first _RARE_ broke somewhere down the line and came _RARE_ over the _RARE_
in a field , in a tight , screeching turn
were _RARE_ up and _RARE_ down
fell on my back , I saw a _RARE_ _RARE_
I got to my knees , there was again the sound of the fence stretching , and I had time only to start taking my _RARE_ _RARE_ seriously
no wire came _RARE_ into the truck
back on the road
my _RARE_ position behind the truck _RARE_ rear window
hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks _RARE_ beneath his fingers
'' , the driver _RARE_ , his black eyes _RARE_ behind dull silver chicken _RARE_
was _RARE_ I was talking
I was a Mexican , didn't you , buddy ''

, that's all right , buddy '' , the Indian ( I now guessed ) said
your beer ''
the bottle was still in my hand , foam still _RARE_ over my ( _RARE_ ) _RARE_ watch
had I started drinking than the driver started _RARE_ the truck
foamed furiously
furiously
time
bottle
_RARE_ back at me , the driver released a _RARE_ of Spanish in which `` _RARE_ '' appeared every so often like an island in the _RARE_ waves of surrounding sound
my head each time it appeared
Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son of a bitch '' , sometimes _RARE_ by vicious _RARE_ of a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering ribs
car was approaching , its _RARE_ teeth grinning
the gray road stretched a long , long way
was just about to us , its _RARE_ fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in _RARE_ _RARE_ -- on anything but an old _RARE_ truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue
the bottle
so it would only _RARE_ _RARE_ but loudly off the _RARE_ steel roof

_RARE_ the bottle shattered into a small _RARE_ flash
''
was again raising his bottle , but to my _RARE_ relief -- probably only a fraction of Johnson's -- the bottle this time went to the _RARE_ lips
was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill
looking on the _RARE_ truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt _RARE_ -- anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle
_RARE_
ditch sand was white and _RARE_ , only an occasional _RARE_ _RARE_ , faintly _RARE_
couldn't quickly _RARE_ the truck door , and if I escaped , he might suffer
was approaching fast
truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of _RARE_ machinery ; ; with more time I could have _RARE_ a small _RARE_ or _RARE_ pin -- Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the _RARE_ in my pocket
no time to pick out a _RARE_ ; ; I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my _RARE_ in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and _RARE_ my little missile
a _RARE_ just under my focus of vision , a crash ; ; the _RARE_ far _RARE_ panel turned into a silver _RARE_ with a dark hole in the center
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me
I saw a _RARE_ man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number
''

came over a _RARE_ , their _RARE_ and glass _RARE_
arm _RARE_ _RARE_ -- there was a flash of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , the crash of the bottle _RARE_ against the side of the first car
behind us
Johnson's bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a _RARE_ of foam just behind the second car
there was no sound of _RARE_ but the _RARE_ of women
back at pale _RARE_ framed in the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ rear window
, you son of a bitch ''
turned around and began to drink
Indian was _RARE_ another bottle toward Johnson
her to the _RARE_ , turned off the TV , faced her
quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes
eyes they were
dark , a melting , golden brown
hot honey , eyes that _RARE_
skin , smooth _RARE_ and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them
a _RARE_ familiar face , too , but I couldn't remember where we had met
, `` Do we know each other , Miss ''
, I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was '' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself
sorry
go on ''

her first smile
waiting for
''

one word at a time , O.K. ''
still hugging the stained coat around her , so I said , `` _RARE_ , let me take your things
like a drink , or coffee ''
, thanks ''
up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let out a _RARE_ scream and I let out a _RARE_ , _RARE_ sound like a _RARE_ blowing out
wearing nothing beneath the coat
the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough
been a good second or two during which my _RARE_ had been blowing out , and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before
forgot ''

, do forgive me
''
forgive '' -- `` That's what started all the trouble in the first place
dear , I'm all _RARE_ ''
and me both , dear
haven't I seen you
, surely we've '' -- `` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said
done several _RARE_ _RARE_ for '' -- Then it hit me
''

, yes
recognized me ''
, indeed
, I was watching you on that little _RARE_ screen when you rang my bell
you rang -- it was in color , too , Miss , and Miss
name , anyway
you were _RARE_ ''
by her on the _RARE_

_RARE_ and all that ''
the last one we did
a fun one ''
bet
fun for me , all right
mean to _RARE_ , but do they hide the _RARE_ with the bubbles
: Is advertising honest
depends on who does it
wear anything at all
-- wouldn't seem fair , somehow ''
couldn't agree with you more ''
really do have something important to tell you , Mr. _RARE_
murder ''

yeah '' , I said
me about the murder ''
me
the creation of two men , Louis Thor and Bill _RARE_ , partners in zing

the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` _RARE_ '' to their secret formula and the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ advertising campaign -- sales had _RARE_ practically into orbit
had been _RARE_ by Good _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ Journal , among other _RARE_ of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you didn't have a _RARE_ of their soap in the _RARE_ , even your best friends would think you didn't _RARE_
_RARE_ -- Joyce _RARE_ was her name -- had previously done three _RARE_ _RARE_ for zing , and this evening , the fourth , a _RARE_ production , had been _RARE_ at the home of Louis Thor
in _RARE_ big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , _RARE_ _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , of course , from zing -- Joyce had _RARE_ from the board into the pool , then _RARE_ and _RARE_ in her _RARE_ `` bath '' while _RARE_ rolled
-- and _RARE_ cut -- product would begin with a _RARE_ _RARE_ of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the _RARE_ surface _RARE_ in layers of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; ; even to clean men and boys
on , `` When we'd finished , Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked me to stay a little longer
a few _RARE_ for magazine ads , he said
and I stayed in the pool , then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too
didn't have any clothes on ''
didn't ''
, he didn't
I mean ''

_RARE_ into the pool , and didn't have anything on
it was evident what he had in mind ''
got away , didn't you ''

up with me once and grabbed me , but I was all covered with zing -- it's very _RARE_ , you know ''
didn't know
have the stuff in the house
pleased to hear '' -- `` So I just _RARE_ out of his _RARE_
like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my _RARE_ , and ran to the car
were still in it , and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little _RARE_ where I'd changed ''
around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have _RARE_ down by that time , she'd gone back to his home on _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , parked in front , and walked toward the pool
yards from it , still _RARE_ by the _RARE_ , she'd seen two men on her left at the _RARE_ edge
on : `` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up
was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead
shoved him into the water , then ran past the _RARE_
walk there that goes out to _RARE_ _RARE_
so scared well , I just ran to my car and came here ''
know who the other man was ''
, I never did see his face
get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit
sure the other one was Lou ''
wanted me to do was go to _RARE_ house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and _RARE_ containing her identification
I'd have to notify the police , but _RARE_ hoped I could avoid _RARE_ her name
in the zing _RARE_ had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an _RARE_ TV series , _RARE_ Western _RARE_ , a _RARE_ show to be sponsored by _RARE_ _RARE_
Joyce got involved in murder or _RARE_ _RARE_ , the role would probably go to the _RARE_ wife , Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_
least not to Joyce
I so want the part '' , she said
_RARE_ have just been for money , there hasn't been any real _RARE_ for me to do them , but in _RARE_ Western _RARE_ I'd have a chance to act
show what I can do ''
as I was concerned , she had already and had _RARE_ shown what she could do
promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last _RARE_
relieved , she smiled one of those _RARE_ smiles , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom
got my _RARE_ _RARE_ and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room
a little on the _RARE_
starting to _RARE_ '' , she said
''
, I'm still all covered with that soap
loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off
it sure _RARE_ ''
might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like ''
, I'd love to ''
her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then _RARE_ for a few minutes in your tub
_RARE_ me
you ''
when I do it ''
my head
my _RARE_ or _RARE_ is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and _RARE_ living color
as long as you want , Joyce
be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you
have everything all to yourself , _RARE_ '' I looked at my watch
nine
go , I supposed
, _RARE_ '' , I said

hurry ''
, you can count on that ''
slightly


hurry too much
soaking for at least half an hour ''
all she said
those _RARE_ eyes seemed to have everything but _RARE_ of bees in them
when there's a job to be done , I'm a _RARE_ of grim determination , I like to think
about and _RARE_ through the front room to the door
went out , I could hear water _RARE_ in the shower

be taking a cold shower
she couldn't
_RARE_ is only two or three miles from the _RARE_ , and it took me less than five minutes to get there
scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected
were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars
in the big house and surrounding grounds
a _RARE_ gravel path alongside the house to the pool
officers , a couple of _RARE_ I knew , and two other men stood on a gray _RARE_ area next to the pool on my left
_RARE_ far end was the little _RARE_ Joyce had mentioned , and on the _RARE_ surface _RARE_ scattered _RARE_ patches of _RARE_ _RARE_
yards beyond the group of men , a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green _RARE_
, one of the _RARE_ , spotted me and said , `` _RARE_ , Shell '' , and walked toward me
you hear about this one ''
, but ignored the question
push it ; ; _RARE_ worked out of Central _RARE_ and we'd been friends for years
me in
to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine _RARE_ , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now
the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been _RARE_ partner Bill _RARE_ , and _RARE_ Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account
them , I understood , had been present at the _RARE_ session earlier
were they doing here ''
_RARE_
were supposed to meet Thor at nine _RARE_ for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this _RARE_ stuff ''
, I've heard more about _RARE_ than space exploration lately

the new advertising angle -- something about a _RARE_ of London policy to insure the _RARE_ of the secret _RARE_
only two men know what the formula is , _RARE_ and '' -- He stopped and looked at _RARE_ body
, `` O.K. , so now only _RARE_ knows
strike you , _RARE_ or fair ''
say yet
says it looks like he _RARE_ in a big pile of those thick suds and _RARE_ on 'em
might show he _RARE_ instead , but that's what the _RARE_ gives us
murder , suicide -- take your pick ''
pick murder
''
to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ locker and started _RARE_ him out
people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; ; this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife
were not for an old _RARE_ who made me read the _RARE_ I would have been _RARE_ on what to do , and now I understand why they are _RARE_ ; ; those who wrote them knew people and what made people _RARE_
for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild _RARE_ of _RARE_ ) who ran one of those _RARE_ shops in New _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , the old French _RARE_
I had with him was to work four hours a day
of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting
a _RARE_ studio which _RARE_ an ancient _RARE_ filled with flowers and plants , _RARE_ _RARE_ in the southern sun
come to New _RARE_ two years earlier after _RARE_ college , partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art _RARE_ there
Uncle offered me a _RARE_ job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted
turned out to be excellent
the city and I particularly loved the _RARE_ and spirit of _RARE_ _RARE_
seen two of them and we would soon be in another _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ with romance in the air ; ; and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of _RARE_ eyes were waiting around the next corner
faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure
as if they could hardly wait to get into their _RARE_ , cover their faces with _RARE_ and go _RARE_
and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages
wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything
morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and _RARE_ me to her as my new Aunt
married over the _RARE_ , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty
more like twenty-five or six
really a May and December combination
Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as _RARE_ a woman who _RARE_ sex
something about the _RARE_ of her face , her smile that was like New _RARE_ _RARE_ , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not _RARE_ me
were the full , _RARE_ kind , full _RARE_ like a rare wine and just as _RARE_ to the appetite ; ; the _RARE_ was magnificent , the ankle perfect
forgive me if I seem to _RARE_ too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body
artist is like one of those _RARE_ who , from a single bone can _RARE_ an _RARE_ entire body
looks at an ankle , a _RARE_ , a bosom and , in his _RARE_ eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is
is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his _RARE_ store
impressed me instantly was obvious ; ; I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly _RARE_ them
I saw a faint _RARE_ of color rise to her neck and quickly _RARE_ her cheeks
she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much care
standing with her back to the glass door
was _RARE_ and with the strong light I could see the _RARE_ of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired
is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something _RARE_
in this instance , but I treated her _RARE_ and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance
appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was _RARE_ lest my Uncle notice it
I became aware that she , too , glanced at me _RARE_
that her eyes were _RARE_ me as if she were a painter and I a nude model
these feelings as _RARE_ thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to _RARE_ on it because of our relationship
eyes met the air was filled with an _RARE_ message of `` Me , too ''
probably experienced this
nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly _RARE_ with a high charge of electricity
married him I do not know
was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me
had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who _RARE_ the _RARE_ of living
with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ; or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ; some women with father _RARE_ do
weeks we eyed one another almost like _RARE_ partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly _RARE_ and stayed home ; ; his bride opened the store
waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my _RARE_ _RARE_
she was telling me about it I became aware of a _RARE_ flush that _RARE_ her neck and moved _RARE_ to her cheeks , and _RARE_ I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights
depth , _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk
her _RARE_ , fingers _RARE_ , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` Now , what next ''
aware of a _RARE_ look in her eyes that told me the time was _RARE_
little _RARE_ of any customers walking in at that hour
standing beside her , watching the _RARE_ _RARE_ and wondering about the old _RARE_ _RARE_ against the wall on which he sometimes _RARE_
and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms _RARE_ me in a _RARE_ _RARE_
, which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender
her _RARE_ , `` We'd better lock the door ''
not take me long to slip the _RARE_ _RARE_ and return to the rear and its couch
opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said : `` He will not always be _RARE_ ''
know
thinking about that
we work it out ''
don't know '' , she said
the man
it out
the way you've been looking at me ever since we met ''
guess we both felt it ''

guess so '' , she said
now what ''
I said it I realized that an education can be _RARE_
know what we can do '' , I said
him I made a pass at you ''
a _RARE_ hand with a startled air
are you trying to do
out
even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew ''
don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will
I have a way so we can carry on without his _RARE_ us ''
telling him you are making passes at me ''
_RARE_
I was in college '' , I grinned , `` I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class
even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or _RARE_ century poets
days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some _RARE_ to tell ; ; and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us
_RARE_ opens officially
of people will _RARE_ the streets in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , and having a ball
be romance and _RARE_
tell him I made a pass at you he might think you _RARE_ something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a _RARE_ I really am
a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake _RARE_
prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead
both the same size
use your clothes for a _RARE_ and a heavy _RARE_ for a mask
show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it ''
you '' -- she began
worry about me
turn out all right ''
don't understand '' , she insisted
you trying to cut your throat ''
'' , I chuckled , `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education ''
expected , on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning
that he looked at me coldly and _RARE_ and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife
work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days
subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French _RARE_ after which he went home to get into his _RARE_ to keep the date
nine I drove my _RARE_ to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view
minutes later I saw my _RARE_ car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner
say the figure was well made up
were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him
hand he gripped firmly a _RARE_ though there had been no indication of rain
why he brought it along
half darkness I approached _RARE_ , making sure he did not see me
looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without _RARE_ words I _RARE_ him hard across the face
cheap bitch ''

cheap , no good , _RARE_ bitch
a good , loyal husband -- _RARE_
you fall for a pass by his own nephew
-- _RARE_
ashamed of yourself
better write a _RARE_ to Walter
the myth book again and there ( along the _RARE_ next to Robert _RARE_ _RARE_ interpretation of the creation of the _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ ) were the names of four _RARE_ bars and Meredith _RARE_ address
were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer
, which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use
to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith , and that might be good for something
on his _RARE_ , a line came back : `` _RARE_ , man , and all the _RARE_ are _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
to draw a laugh , Nicolas _RARE_ , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind
, his _RARE_ did draw from Walter a letter _RARE_ his friend , the poet Nicolas _RARE_ , to his friend Meredith _RARE_
later , on receiving it , Meredith sat _RARE_ his _RARE_ on his writing table

cried
was large and square and heavily tanned
crying in him was the voice of guilt
weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months
returned to the _RARE_ a week ago
he was just in the late poems of _RARE_ and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next _RARE_ class preparation
determined to spend an _RARE_ summer
maybe _RARE_ wouldn't call
slowed and stopped over a line before him : _RARE_ _RARE_ , die _RARE_ _RARE_
of _RARE_ gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' How the dark _RARE_ laughed '
more _RARE_ , ' The _RARE_ _RARE_ are laughing '
missed the point that the _RARE_ _RARE_ might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas _RARE_
, too , was being interrupted , that morning
the _RARE_ sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English _RARE_ and sent him off to sleep ; ; but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and _RARE_ regarded him
wake him
have the heart
, her _RARE_ feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly _RARE_ by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from _RARE_
just not able to break the spell
she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet _RARE_ Nicolas had found his first night in one of _RARE_ marked bars
`` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see
all these _RARE_ was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money ''
: _RARE_ , tears , and `` take what you want , Nicolas , I am a _RARE_ , you are a poet , it is all beautiful ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ Nicolas had replied , `` O.K. I can use this blanket
you get off this job tonight , well , you can _RARE_ something to eat ''
as a matter of fact , Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that _RARE_ early mornings even in summer are _RARE_ with _RARE_
always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms
the blanket for late morning _RARE_ when _RARE_ of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions
_RARE_ knew none of this
Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a _RARE_ , black hair falling over his eyes
telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth
surely a _RARE_ in art , it was all that poetry promised
night with Nicolas and _RARE_ in _RARE_ had opened her eyes
, his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had _RARE_ his hair -- this was all new
had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith
day he was gone
might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined
, it took her several days to force Walter to tell her _RARE_ _RARE_
small suitcase , _RARE_ her husband whom she found in _RARE_ Bar that she was taking a train to Germany to get away for a while , _RARE_ his arm , _RARE_ a drink , getting on the train -- all this had only taken her two hours
arrived this morning and come straight to the English _RARE_
girl '' , Walter had finally said , `` he _RARE_ me that he is sleeping in the English _RARE_ ''
like him ''
had _RARE_ said
address '' , Walter added , `` is that great _RARE_ home , the American _RARE_
will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband
the last half hour Mary Jane had _RARE_ half the length of the _RARE_ and , at last , come upon her _RARE_
there , asleep in the grass , confirmed all that Mary Jane believed it was in his power to teach her : freedom from the _RARE_ of needs such as hotels , the meaning of nature , how to live , simply , with the angels
down her suitcase
wake him

she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched
grew _RARE_ as it approached the _RARE_
dreaming he had his head pressed against the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ car
_RARE_
dream he cried , `` _RARE_ down , for _RARE_ ''
woke and rolled over with his face in the _RARE_ grass
was _RARE_

his nose _RARE_ between his fingers

sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs
, he stretched
got up , quietly , and walked away
later she was at the desk of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , her tears dried , _RARE_ a hotel form and asking for a bath
belonged to a world _RARE_ with small attractive hotels and _RARE_ in all the major and minor cities
retreated to this world
, who was _RARE_ by her , told her , `` Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair
very interesting
there is no bath
young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once
we shall see
The _RARE_ was _RARE_ to the word shall
was _RARE_ when the _RARE_ knocked at his door and told him , `` She is a great beauty
allow her not to have a bath
she is a sad beauty , I believe
see her at dinner ''
he listened to the bath water running ; ; when it stopped he began _RARE_ _RARE_ , sitting up in a _RARE_ way
, he shaved for the second time that day
he did not like doing , generally
the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan
his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew _RARE_ of _RARE_ as he washed
small _RARE_ used as the _RARE_ dining room , Meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began _RARE_ the young _RARE_
asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the _RARE_ followed by a _RARE_ blond girl approaching his table
be literary license calculated to _RARE_ life to say that he , oh , dropped his _RARE_ , so startled was he by Mary _RARE_ beauty
did drop his _RARE_ with the ordinary country girl as much in _RARE_ to the _RARE_ as _RARE_ that here , indeed , was something special
had made very little effort
dark green skirt she wore a pale green _RARE_ sweater with , as he soon perceived , no _RARE_ beneath
blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders
eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day
touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip _RARE_ which made her lips _RARE_ but no _RARE_ than usual
was grace and _RARE_
was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with _RARE_ of intelligence and control
falling in love
`` Only this morning '' ; ; _RARE_ _RARE_ : `` Oh , I couldn't possibly eat all this ''
_RARE_ : `` Then you were _RARE_ poems this afternoon ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ; a smile
a beautiful room
if it were built of books ''
the windows onto the _RARE_ , lit the fire , translated the _RARE_ , Meredith grinned and took down a little _RARE_ of books bound together in old _RARE_
he brought out a _RARE_ bottle and small gold _RARE_ glasses hidden inside it

the _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ of the trip that had frightened her
hated the whole idea before they started
she had hated him before she ever saw him
been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , administered by her mother
of their wedding night still _RARE_ within him like an open wound
jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a _RARE_
left her _RARE_ , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time

it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them
or property , what would you have had at _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
might have _RARE_ , but at least I wouldn't be _RARE_ to a _RARE_ and _RARE_ with dirt ''
under his heavy burn
eyes sought the _RARE_ sea of _RARE_ ahead
_RARE_ , there suddenly was no _RARE_
lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the _RARE_ line of _RARE_ , _RARE_ hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead
noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , _RARE_ clouds that formed even as they _RARE_ over the _RARE_ of the surrounding hills
never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a _RARE_ in _RARE_
_RARE_ , `` _RARE_ on ''
the oxen as he yelled
to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm
, he realized that in turning , he had _RARE_ them onto a patch of _RARE_ ground , instead of _RARE_ a grade or ridge
up over the wheel
had better get inside '' , he warned her
sat on in stubborn silence
_RARE_ downward and burst suddenly into a great black _RARE_
they stared at it _RARE_ down the valley , _RARE_ and _RARE_ out _RARE_ and _RARE_ of earth like a _RARE_ _RARE_ dog cracking _RARE_
_RARE_ began to whip and shake
turned black
filled with dust and wind and sound and violence
opened , _RARE_ them with _RARE_ the size of _RARE_
came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that _RARE_ down like water _RARE_ from a _RARE_
water rushed down the _RARE_ and filled the _RARE_ like the _RARE_ of flash _RARE_
_RARE_ of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , _RARE_ big _RARE_ out of the banks
, _RARE_ surface of the river reached the level of the _RARE_
current upon the _RARE_ _RARE_ , but the water stood and kept on rising
under _RARE_ covers , listening to the waves _RARE_ against the bottom
cut off abruptly
_RARE_ by the _RARE_ silence , broken only by the low , angry _RARE_ of the river
darkness _RARE_ , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight
fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the _RARE_ deck and looked out _RARE_ at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills
level was higher than their _RARE_
heavy bones of the oxen kept them _RARE_
no real sign of the river now , just a _RARE_ , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere
brush rode down the ribbon
then , the _RARE_ side of a _RARE_ object showed as it swept past
crawled out into the _RARE_ warmth of the _RARE_ , hugging her shoulders and still trembling
was pale but set and her dark eyes _RARE_ with blame for Ben
_RARE_ to say something _RARE_ , Ben _RARE_ _RARE_ , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first _RARE_ hit
, the wheels dug in
will put life back in the wagon , too ''
didn't give a sign she'd heard
watching a tree ride wildly down that _RARE_ current
riding the tree
closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting _RARE_ an upright branch
not call out
the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell
the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend
up into the air , then _RARE_ back , the _RARE_ branch turned slowly
_RARE_ of the woman disappeared
the one who's lucky ''
murmured _RARE_
strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and _RARE_
took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the _RARE_ , _RARE_ their comfort more than they needed his
nearly _RARE_ and he went to the back of the wagon , _RARE_ his way , for he was not a tall man
down the _RARE_ and was knocked over by the _RARE_ of water
back to his feet and scrambled _RARE_ to pull his _RARE_ of seed grain forward
already swollen to bursting
their _RARE_ _RARE_ , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most _RARE_
spoiled now for seed , and it would _RARE_ and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it
might as well enjoy it
the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished
lay muddy but _RARE_ , without a _RARE_ of movement against the wheels ; ; there was not a _RARE_ of damp mark to show they were _RARE_
if a man could _RARE_ as far as the _RARE_ , dry hills that _RARE_ the valley
, _RARE_ sense of _RARE_ swept over him
the wheel hard to fight the _RARE_ of _RARE_
noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen
were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece
within him
toward the front to give the news to _RARE_ , then stopped , _RARE_ from her by the _RARE_ of her blame and hate
he felt better
wagon meant so much
a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee
the water off the _RARE_ and off the _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ for _RARE_ of a sort
and _RARE_ had not suffered
a _RARE_ of preserved _RARE_ and one of eggs that they had meant to save
broke them open , hoping a good meal might _RARE_ this depression _RARE_ _RARE_
nose _RARE_ at the _RARE_ of _RARE_ bacon and _RARE_ _RARE_ , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time
the slashed sides of the canvas _RARE_ , leaving the ribs and wagon open
thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ , `` _RARE_ , I don't figure your things got wet too much
good trunk
want to get them _RARE_ '' She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in _RARE_ the dust , there isn't a thing that won't be _RARE_ ''
a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and _RARE_ upon the wagon ribs
oil , and _RARE_ make the kind of _RARE_ any _RARE_ dreams of
a _RARE_ _RARE_ had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the _RARE_
_RARE_ up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the _RARE_ heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like _RARE_ sheep , not knowing what to do
were stuck fast
_RARE_ them
a cry from a _RARE_ as a _RARE_ of flame leaped from a _RARE_ and _RARE_ the man's bare back
to the rail and leaped _RARE_ into the _RARE_ waters
bad _RARE_ shook _RARE_ No. 3 which _RARE_ violently in the _RARE_
: `` Come on , _RARE_ , Max step on it , we got a chance now
those _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ come _RARE_ ''
and swore and _RARE_ and wept , _RARE_ our hands until they _RARE_ _RARE_
was quivering and _RARE_ like an old _RARE_ mare
was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the _RARE_ which dropped heavily into the water
Max and I leaped into the sea and _RARE_ to the boat
get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his _RARE_ of _RARE_ hair
tub is going to _RARE_ all at once ''
_RARE_ seemed to _RARE_ with a roar of live steam , _RARE_ of _RARE_ and flames , and a dense cloud of _RARE_ smoke
we heard the voices of men in _RARE_ agony but we couldn't go back into that _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ was filled with five inches of water
, you _RARE_ while we row '' , Brassnose commanded
as I could determine , we were some _RARE_ miles west of New _RARE_ , in the _RARE_ _RARE_
previously , we had _RARE_ past _RARE_ _RARE_ Island in the distance
peered anxiously for any _RARE_ of land in the Pacific , for this _RARE_ _RARE_ would have to stop soon
gigantic _RARE_ and rope _RARE_ on our hands ; ; our muscles were hot wires of pain
_RARE_ silent
man with the _RARE_ hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the _RARE_ tongue , which I recognized , having studied the _RARE_ in my _RARE_ 6 , class at the University of Chicago
said something which struck a _RARE_ in my memory
help us if we're near the island of Eromonga
in real trouble then
keep _RARE_ -- or sink ''
puzzled by the remark , then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard _RARE_ three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies
been speaking of this _RARE_ : `` Even when the _RARE_ were under German _RARE_ before World War 1 , , _RARE_ gave Eromonga a wide _RARE_
is _RARE_ by several hundred _RARE_ women who are _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ -- stone age _RARE_ who live in an _RARE_ , _RARE_ society which is _RARE_ ''
, too , the _RARE_ voice of a _RARE_ , Bobby _RARE_ : `` But how do they _RARE_ , Dr. _RARE_
that males have something to do with that process ''
been classroom _RARE_ which quickly _RARE_ as Professor _RARE_ said _RARE_ : `` I see your point , _RARE_
, males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga
you wouldn't live long , for the females either drive the men they've seized from _RARE_ _RARE_ back to their boats after _RARE_ them for _RARE_ purposes , or they destroy them by _RARE_ but ingenious methods
, one important aspect of their very religion is the _RARE_ of men ''
think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said
know something about Eromonga
we come to a _RARE_ place ''
didn't
later , while we were _RARE_ desperately , a dot of land came into view
_RARE_ made a sign over his heart with his two linked _RARE_ : I recognized it as an ancient _RARE_ gesture intended to _RARE_ the _RARE_
passed ; ; we had _RARE_ closer
voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big _RARE_ mate _RARE_ : `` _RARE_
Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden _RARE_ on the cliff ''
at the looming _RARE_
a wooden tower or _RARE_ there , something like a _RARE_ jump ; ; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been _RARE_ constructed of _RARE_
example of engineering in a primitive society
is the _RARE_ for , Brassnose ''
a sound of despair deep in his throat
_RARE_ to see _RARE_ , blonde Brassnose _RARE_ himself like a child who _RARE_ about _RARE_

their _RARE_ , the ' jumping platform ' of death
the last of the three tests of _RARE_ which the women _RARE_ , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there
I heard my _RARE_ and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in _RARE_
never seen a _RARE_ but they had heard about it from their _RARE_ ''
was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ by three _RARE_ girls _RARE_ out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft
Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of _RARE_ in his blood -- to speak to them
had turned a _RARE_ green and appeared _RARE_ or _RARE_
I _RARE_ my few words of the _RARE_ _RARE_ and said , `` We _RARE_ you in peace

and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire
_RARE_ and hungry ; ; our _RARE_ and burned hands and arms need attention ''
in the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ turned a smile like a _RARE_ on me
that her full _RARE_ were bare and that she wore a _RARE_ of red _RARE_ fruit in her _RARE_ hair
, `` My name is _RARE_ and these girls are _RARE_ and _RARE_
welcome to Eromonga
_RARE_ you on the shore
have food , water and rest ''
later , the _RARE_ _RARE_ on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with _RARE_ _RARE_ to a large _RARE_
a dozen or so other _RARE_ _RARE_ there

_RARE_ _RARE_ of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight
a _RARE_ of _RARE_ human bones and _RARE_ at the base of the big wooden _RARE_
been there for years ; ; others still had _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ flesh _RARE_ to them
one object which _RARE_ yet _RARE_ me
also a corpse -- a male , _RARE_ from the _RARE_ arm bands , the _RARE_ scars still _RARE_ on the _RARE_ face , the painted bone of the _RARE_ _RARE_ which still _RARE_ the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ nose
may have been two or three _RARE_ dead
with _RARE_ at the legs
shattered
bones _RARE_ _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of flesh
must have leaped to his death from the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_
_RARE_ my thoughts , the girl _RARE_ smiled _RARE_ and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in _RARE_ her rose garden : `` This is our _RARE_ , a jumping platform , _RARE_
you shall know it better
not _RARE_
one blew down in a storm at the time of the _RARE_ _RARE_ fifteen _RARE_ ago
thirty of our women almost six _RARE_ to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one
very proud of it ''
have every right to be '' , I replied _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the _RARE_ and strongest of us
as if he was going to _RARE_ over
a _RARE_ in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid

the big man with the _RARE_ hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the _RARE_ _RARE_
your language too , for he is the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ on _RARE_ who made much magic and was strong and _RARE_
_RARE_ has inherited this strength from his _RARE_ ''

was _RARE_ and she told me many things
_RARE_ , _RARE_ old _RARE_ was a mine of information
had a great _RARE_ of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women
account was later confirmed by the _RARE_ _RARE_ from the University of _RARE_ in 1951
_RARE_ , I heard that until about _RARE_ the people of this island -- which was about the size of Guam or smaller -- had been of both _RARE_ , and that the normal family life of _RARE_ _RARE_ was observed here with minor variations
the middle of the last century an island woman named `` _RARE_ '' seized a _RARE_ in the heat of an _RARE_ battle and _RARE_ the women after their men had fled
_RARE_ and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred _RARE_ from the _RARE_ of _RARE_ back to their war _RARE_ , after considerable loss of life on both sides

men went away from here

women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- _RARE_ -- for just the strongest men could stay here
I show you ''
woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood
shade of a _RARE_ tree in front of the _RARE_ dwelling I saw four figures in a _RARE_ on the ground
guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home
beat up on his _RARE_ ''
up and saw _RARE_ long head _RARE_ forward to _RARE_ his chin on the stiff edge of the overall _RARE_
out with the tire iron and _RARE_ a _RARE_ of mud that was _RARE_ on the spare tire rack
like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles ''
thought of a simple man _RARE_ by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver
moment his hatred toward _RARE_ or _RARE_ drivers _RARE_
Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought
was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us
he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at
see yourself spread out on the pavement , _RARE_ ''
to his partner
mean dream ''
exactly
it ''
and _RARE_ a rock with his thumb like a marble
, just you , all the time -- sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner ''
but he thought to himself , I always see me too

saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind
would realize they were really things that only he himself could think
realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down
seen him yet ''
, referring to the Indian
wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said
didn't go clear around '' , Benson said
you want to see something , he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car ''
long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke
minutes later the insurance man , a road _RARE_ , drove up in the gray _RARE_ with license plates on it from a _RARE_ state
a trick they used to try and _RARE_ their identity when they followed _RARE_ to check their speed
just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the _RARE_ as they passed
drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big _RARE_ straw hat with _RARE_ edges , the kind _RARE_ in travel ads wear when they are out _RARE_ _RARE_ cane
an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist
always seemed strange to Ramey that to _RARE_ himself as a tourist , an _RARE_ driver like _RARE_ would merely pick something _RARE_ and put it on his head
man informed them that he had talked to _RARE_ who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they _RARE_ the _RARE_ back to town
with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the _RARE_ shade of the trailer
often the _RARE_ sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the _RARE_ then _RARE_ up again as it got clear
were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer
a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped
driven up with her husband in a _RARE_ with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that
shorts and a loose _RARE_ shirt
tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply

caused a _RARE_ in Ramey , a recognition
have been someone he had once loved
never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run
_RARE_ , the industrial areas with walls _RARE_ with _RARE_ smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back _RARE_ were their access to a city and they could never stay
you ever see her again
_RARE_ , it was only a small _RARE_
was lonely
she doing in this bunch ''
, and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been
looked around at the _RARE_
swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing
only a tiny _RARE_ over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on
to watch a _RARE_ man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the _RARE_ car in the one spot that most of the crowd had _RARE_ slightly
caught his attention was _RARE_ by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was
took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that _RARE_ _RARE_ Ramey could never decide was real , said , `` You don't want to go around there , _RARE_ ''
stopped but did not turn her head or _RARE_ that someone had spoken to her
stood near the bent _RARE_ body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car
drivers moved closer
does he want , a _RARE_ ''
to Ramey
detail in a happening can _RARE_ the memory and stick like meat in a _RARE_ _RARE_ , while the rest of the occurrence will go _RARE_ and uncertain
it was a dusty work shoe that was _RARE_ the _RARE_ foot that he would always remember
were broken at the bottom of the _RARE_ but there was still a bow knot at the top
_RARE_ would have _RARE_ the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside
men in _RARE_ stood just behind the _RARE_ man
tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the _RARE_ pushed above the _RARE_
and looked at them with clear blue eyes , _RARE_ eyes
very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a _RARE_ _RARE_
dead , isn't he ''
said
and bent over the body of the Indian
nothing in particular on the man's face
simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine
this ''
said , backing up a step , still looking down
were mostly to himself
''
a gentle concern in _RARE_ voice
down and saw the white _RARE_ at the bottom of the man's tanned leg _RARE_ _RARE_ a bit of folded , _RARE_ substance lying by itself on the pavement
what is it ''
said with a tone of impatience
is it
had spoken only once
the words again inside , _RARE_ , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or _RARE_ pressing in his ears
reached out once more to tap against the mass and _RARE_ vision darkened except for an _RARE_ clarity of the man's leg
sunlight touch the _RARE_ blonde hairs on the brown skin
at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` Don't do that , _RARE_
''
seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist
and caught the man just to the left of his mouth
a straight , solid , _RARE_ shot ; ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man's _RARE_ and his chin
and the air _RARE_ from the man's _RARE_ cheek made a hollow _RARE_ in the air like _RARE_ hands _RARE_ together
took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement
a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand
watched the man sit suddenly , a _RARE_ part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet
done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard
thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him
hung like empty shirt _RARE_ , and his mouth was slightly open
seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to _RARE_ from it
brought one hand up slowly and the fingers _RARE_ across his face until he touched his mouth
and pulled the hand away
there was no realization in his eyes
hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him
not look around
happened ''

hurt ''
voice said , and then he heard a sort of _RARE_ from the man's wife
on the ground began to move ; ; one of his hands _RARE_ out on the pavement and supported him
down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark _RARE_ of dirt that ran _RARE_ across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V _RARE_ into the _RARE_ had _RARE_ , running a _RARE_ color
_RARE_ by her husband with one arm at his back
you hear , can you talk to me ''

, puzzled sound came from the red mouth
looked around quickly at several of the people
the crowd had stepped forward to help
saw Ramey and her face was _RARE_ with _RARE_
did you do it -- why did you hit him ''
, her voice rising
nothing
in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again
feet scraped beneath sharp questioning _RARE_
seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out
around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the _RARE_ truck talking to the _RARE_
his arms , _RARE_ with an unfamiliar _RARE_ and talking rapidly
a glimpse of the insurance man
the _RARE_ was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey
over now , the driver thought as he saw the _RARE_ turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them
him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer
the dark sweat spots _RARE_ in and out of sight under the _RARE_ swinging arms and in the leather holster that _RARE_ and rolled at the side of his _RARE_ body , the sun left a _RARE_ _RARE_ on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his pistol
right , step back ''
said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in _RARE_
straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him
all right ''
-- it's my _RARE_ '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips
face looked gray from dirt _RARE_ where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it
calmly and carefully _RARE_ the remaining five shots into the _RARE_ head -- caught in the _RARE_ back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the _RARE_
continued to _RARE_ , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the _RARE_ , _RARE_ mass out of the _RARE_
the door and listened as his servants ran up , _RARE_ at the sound of the shots
their _RARE_ , and then the sounds of _RARE_ as they _RARE_ the snake right on the porch with wood axes
only then that he turned to look at Penny
sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her
had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , _RARE_ into her eyes and the lines of her mouth
hands were calm , now
guts , thought Keith
more guts than any other woman in the world
'' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful
suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am
, Keith ''
at her _RARE_
the _RARE_ time that week , he was startled at her beauty

they'd been married
her mind pretty well , by now , its quick _RARE_ and _RARE_ , its painful insistence on truth and _RARE_ , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to _RARE_ , even in part
beauty always surprised him _RARE_
realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny '' , said Keith
knowing you , I know that you're glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to
so ''
her eyes
'' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if _RARE_ to a crime
snake was beautiful , wasn't it ''
, his voice getting _RARE_ in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger
was a _RARE_ _RARE_ , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it

did not answer
she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him
all God's creatures , aren't we ''
_RARE_ now
of us -- every _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ and killer in that jungle
this village and these _RARE_ brown people because they're God's creatures , too
love _RARE_ , that black bastard of a _RARE_ even a little more , because he's a beautiful man
loves you because you're a beautiful woman
God's creatures , aren't we , Penny
us , that is , except me
me , you hate my guts , because I like to _RARE_
hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that _RARE_ snake
why don't you say something ''
not rise to his mood
isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith ''
let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the _RARE_
she was not _RARE_ , not even angry at him
he knew that she had stopped _RARE_ him

brief period each year , the _RARE_ of the sun are warm enough to _RARE_ some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the _RARE_ , and then the _RARE_ _RARE_ in the daytime at high noon , and _RARE_ of _RARE_ of water begin their slow _RARE_ under the _RARE_ and across the _RARE_ hanging _RARE_ on their long , _RARE_ journey to the sea -- running east past the _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ , then turning south and _RARE_ down through the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , past the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and into _RARE_ , past _RARE_ and _RARE_ , until the hard water of the melting snows _RARE_ with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to _RARE_ with the _RARE_ salt depths of the Bay of _RARE_
had looked down on the _RARE_ more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the _RARE_ of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space
looked down more than up
of the _RARE_ below him , and of the wild , strange , _RARE_ beauty there and he promised himself that _RARE_ he would return , on foot perhaps , to _RARE_ in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the _RARE_
it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of _RARE_ _RARE_ after the war
after the war '' was a _RARE_ of a phrase he did not permit himself
in the _RARE_ do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves
record of _RARE_ made him a man to listen to -- a man _RARE_ , who might even survive
a _RARE_ pilot after the _RARE_ over the _RARE_ in the big _RARE_
was _RARE_ weapon of _RARE_ , and flying a _RARE_ plane was the way her _RARE_ could serve her best at this point in the war

knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the _RARE_ on it -- because he was _RARE_ _RARE_ of fear

half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself

the next morning , they were _RARE_ at The _RARE_ and the boat was riding directly over the _RARE_ _RARE_ where the green water turned to _RARE_ blue and the cliff dropped straight down _RARE_ _RARE_ , with the _RARE_ line beside it ; ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface
his safety man , Herr Schaffner , _RARE_ up to the _RARE_ ladder together
_RARE_ indicated that Robinson should _RARE_ first
heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his _RARE_ assembly
frowning
his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck
, _RARE_ '' , Mrs. _RARE_ said , laughing _RARE_
blonde hanging onto a _RARE_ youth and beauty , but _RARE_ _RARE_ in the neck , she was already working on her second _RARE_ and _RARE_ , though it was not yet ten A.M. `` I _RARE_ it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice
I have to do to set the record is to go on down
I come up ''
it my equipment ''
asked
it something went bad with the breathing ''
equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up
a huge young man of _RARE_ , _RARE_ in muscle , _RARE_ strong , with a _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ of manner that was _RARE_ under his present _RARE_
_RARE_ at the floor
was down to _RARE_
that far half a dozen times
get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick ''
, I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder
are a big _RARE_ _RARE_ and you got this idea about setting a record
also got this little _RARE_ in your _RARE_ that tells you to turn around before you _RARE_ yourself
turn around ''
, it wasn't that '' , Rob said
of _RARE_ came into his voice
I came up , _RARE_ , I thought I was going down
up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening ''
'' , Artie said , and climbed in
right '' , Robinson said
was expecting it , sure
it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think
head back down again
, anyway
away ''
his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was _RARE_ by what had just happened to him
the _RARE_ , was a fellow in his middle _RARE_ , with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ glasses , and a large jaw _RARE_ with fat
was going to show how much he knew
boy didn't chicken out , no sir
into the _RARE_ of the depths

the _RARE_ feel drunk ''
, that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. _RARE_ said , and gave her _RARE_ laugh
not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , Artie said
'' , Waddell went on
nothing to fool with
kill you
I don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I _RARE_ losing the story ''
giving anything up '' , Robinson said
there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ; and yet like a child among adults
think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride
down again ''

exclaimed

a _RARE_ , _RARE_ man in his early _RARE_ , very _RARE_ in his _RARE_ cap , _RARE_ jacket and white _RARE_
to _RARE_ West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` _RARE_ '' was never used without _RARE_
_RARE_ , who had once lost a _RARE_ bet on whether he could get both _RARE_ started and turn on the running lights without _RARE_ turning on something else first
did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had _RARE_ from the streets , the object of his pride
'' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn't think twice about it
him along ever since he was a _RARE_ hanging around his brother's _RARE_ shop
I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , Rob ''

down the steps to the _RARE_ and sleeping quarters ; ; went into the forward _RARE_ and locked the door behind him
you _RARE_ go , you _RARE_ go '' , Mrs. _RARE_ said
something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge
disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the _RARE_
there , Schaffner '' , he had said
I make you one ''
thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his _RARE_ English
do not drink so much , thank you ''
looked the man over , trying to size him up
in his early _RARE_ , rather short and very _RARE_ built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to _RARE_ himself to American ways
face seemed to promise a sort of _RARE_ , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence
heard that he had been a _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ Corps , and he said to himself : I'd hate to run into him in the _RARE_ on a dark night
had said , making conversation : `` Rob tells me he's using your _RARE_ equipment on the dive ''
'' , Herr Schaffner had said
one hell of a decent boy
that kid ''
agree , yes ''
if the dive goes _RARE_ he has the exclusive _RARE_ rights to your line for this country , is that right ''
, no '' , Herr Schaffner said
to face him
''

that's what he told me
that's his main reason for making the dive ''
at him , altogether without _RARE_ , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands
do you mean ''
, frowning
let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still _RARE_ of _RARE_

not an _RARE_ moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard
you tell him all this ''

not in so many words '' , the German said
surely you have _RARE_ Mr. Roy
never did I offer him the exclusive rights
of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity
most eager to make the dive ; ; of course , I was willing
was no definite agreement about business arrangements ''
, damn '' , Waddell said
the end of his _RARE_ feature story , with _RARE_
out the door
moment ''
said
_RARE_ to speak with Mr. Roy ''
else ''

you will _RARE_ , I think it would be better if not
is determined to make this dive
tell him he will dive
this from my _RARE_ with him ''
, let's let him make up his own mind , _RARE_ ''

the basis of the facts ''
will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said
200 , 300 , _RARE_ feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him
not good , Mr. Waddell : you will do him great harm ''
no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said
back from the door and sat on a bunk
am an honest man '' , the German said with _RARE_
will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive
make him _RARE_ for all of Florida -- a big market
come to Florida
help him to get out of his little _RARE_ shop

is no use causing him to worry at this time ''
words worked on the _RARE_ like a _RARE_ from an _RARE_ duty
a big _RARE_ of his drink
be a _RARE_ shame to throw away a story like this
think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said
has the _RARE_ for Florida , you say ''
'' , the German said
least for South Florida ''
God '' , Waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times
you're right ''
his drink around and drained it in a few large _RARE_
was _RARE_ up _RARE_ in his mind : the young _RARE_ , as of old , _RARE_ _RARE_ the unknown ; ; the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ in modern _RARE_ America
me in another ''
asked
you '' , the German had said _RARE_
do not drink so much ''
in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk
relief _RARE_ in his _RARE_ emotions
his _RARE_ together and addressed himself to the _RARE_ saint of _RARE_ in a hurried and anxious whisper
_RARE_ _RARE_ , I thank _RARE_ for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was _RARE_
I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ; crossed himself ; ; said a _RARE_ Mary , slowly and with understanding
his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to _RARE_
Mary , Mother of God , _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , stay _RARE_ with me on this next dive
come off all right
set the record this time , and let me get back _RARE_ , so the German will give me the exclusive
my life different and better from this time on

himself again and rose
a good deal less _RARE_
reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk
picked up a _RARE_ and was _RARE_ it on his forefinger
_RARE_ before he said , `` Roy , you know your _RARE_ table , don't you ''
know I know it '' , Robinson answered _RARE_
came straight up from _RARE_ without a stop '' , Artie said
, I was a little bit confused
I wasn't down long enough to matter
see me stretched out on the deck , do you ''
know what they say about two deep _RARE_ in one day '' , Artie went on , still _RARE_ the _RARE_ and studying it _RARE_
don't think you should go down again ''
day Matsuo saw a marine
came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a _RARE_ shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were _RARE_
feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and _RARE_ to make a stand
the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed
_RARE_ part of the tree , _RARE_ a broad _RARE_ _RARE_ , he could see over the meadow
while he was content to let events develop in their good time
no doubt the marine was the lead _RARE_ of a column , and while his shot had probably _RARE_ _RARE_ , they would soon come hunting
had emphasized that marines _RARE_ others for the _RARE_ pleasure
; today ; ; tomorrow : no surrender
the _RARE_ brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt
to himself , with _RARE_ : `` No surrender ''
best to die fighting the marines
had also _RARE_ this , saying it was the way for eternal honor
the marines never came
were all dead
no rice
would be a choice between _RARE_ and suicide
way , he would _RARE_ in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an _RARE_ of his _RARE_
and leaned for a moment against the trunk
touched the bone handle of a knife
, an ammunition _RARE_ , and a _RARE_ bottle of purified water hung on his belt
belt he wore a _RARE_ cloth
looked up from picking at a leg _RARE_ , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing

came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though _RARE_ whether to brave the sunlight
made a _RARE_ of almost _RARE_ green in the mist
out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath
leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face

his rifle , _RARE_ the _RARE_ under his left upper arm for _RARE_
his mind were events of the past day when his whole _RARE_ was destroyed in the hills
fought from _RARE_ , and the marines _RARE_ to burning them out
, like a ringing in his ears , he heard the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ great orange _RARE_
of flame _RARE_ through their cave had reached _RARE_ , his friend , and with a _RARE_ the man _RARE_ through the entrance , then slowed to the _RARE_ walk of a _RARE_ , his uniform _RARE_
let him advance
sank on his knees , they had allowed him to _RARE_ without _RARE_ the _RARE_ of mercy
_RARE_ death and was _RARE_ on a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , both the burned and the _RARE_ , the latter _RARE_ rapidly under the _RARE_ sun
marines had laughed at each _RARE_ _RARE_ , while _RARE_ bodies
_RARE_ down his own _RARE_
he had been able to _RARE_ down a _RARE_ and into the jungle , _RARE_ of death
peered to the left , to the right into the _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
that the marines must be _RARE_ around the meadow , with the one left to _RARE_ him
his hearing
_RARE_ on _RARE_ ; ; faint _RARE_ of belts and _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ : he heard none of these
_RARE_ of insects and the distant _RARE_ call of a bird
couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there
occurred across the meadow : the _RARE_ marine took a seat on the ground ; ; leaning _RARE_ on a tree trunk , he _RARE_ it
Matsuo tremble
_RARE_ _RARE_ the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull _RARE_
at the man's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind
the _RARE_ marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head
_RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ of sound

_RARE_ boy expecting punishment , Matsuo _RARE_ reaction from the jungle
to give his position away
did not _RARE_
remained seated hugging the tree
the atmosphere _RARE_ to its old _RARE_ , and insects _RARE_ and birds occasionally called
and grew anxious over the complete _RARE_ , _RARE_ that he was the butt of a _RARE_ joke
so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes
into a _RARE_ dance , a sort of blind _RARE_ of the tail
when he tumbled ; ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction
no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon
sudden _RARE_ he _RARE_ in _RARE_ direction , crossing the meadow in a _RARE_ _RARE_
got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face
of his jacket _RARE_

head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk
spun , _RARE_ a hand high on his chest , and _RARE_ forward
_RARE_ that followed the _RARE_ , Matsuo was tense
come on him now without difficulty
reached a conclusion
was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have _RARE_ to knock him from the tree
tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of _RARE_
was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended
when the hidden arm flopped out

on the man , he made a rush
in the sunlight , pressed in like an _RARE_ crowd
by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground
_RARE_ motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back
_RARE_
had _RARE_ in the area of the right _RARE_ ; ; around the hole , blood _RARE_ in a little patch
_RARE_ on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while _RARE_ in the jacket pockets
: a package of cigarettes and a _RARE_ _RARE_ , both sticky from the man's bleeding
other : a _RARE_ with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief
one he tossed the objects aside
smoke and could not light fires with a _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running
was no saying how many times the marine had _RARE_ his nose on the handkerchief
the marine had no water
holder he took his own _RARE_
was stuck and made a thin _RARE_ _RARE_ as he applied pressure
eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened _RARE_ in the glare
alive
the bottle to his own lips
reached up a hand
his head
for you ''
_RARE_ , soon dropping his hand
had he no _RARE_ , but he _RARE_ even the belt to hang one on
came well equipped to die ''
made him lean over the man
and recognized it

had been his difficulty
sake , he must have wandered off from his _RARE_
tried to roll on his right side , and _RARE_
rolled on the left side , _RARE_ on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over
a good _RARE_ ''
one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle
of sake had _RARE_ _RARE_ events in his thoughts
_RARE_ , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake
shut his eyes
you a _RARE_ of flame , marine ''
the small knife from its _RARE_ and laid it on the ground , out of the _RARE_ reach and away from their shadows
in his _RARE_ , _RARE_ the hair
often he turned the knife
was _RARE_ in the intense sunlight
was noon high and Matsuo _RARE_ until his body was _RARE_
were the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the face had an oily film
had thrown the left hand over his eyes
again he murmured something that ended in a _RARE_
have _RARE_ himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his _RARE_ _RARE_
his head

he reached for the knife
bone handle _RARE_ , and he retrieved the _RARE_ handkerchief to _RARE_ it
barely touched the blade on the hand which _RARE_ the eyes
yelled and flung the hand away
firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek
_RARE_ , kicked legs , and _RARE_ hands that circled _RARE_ wrist
free and burned the hands into _RARE_ ; ; burned the other cheek ; ; burned each hand when they came _RARE_ again
_RARE_ to weep and it _RARE_ the sense of _RARE_
up
small measure of payment , marine ''
the knife in its _RARE_ , hung the rifle behind a shoulder
, hands on cheeks , rolled by his _RARE_ side onto his stomach
_RARE_
toward his tree , once glancing back
was still
soon die
climbed by using the _RARE_ and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom _RARE_ him like a jungle shadow

jungle , birds were _RARE_ , while insects preserved only the _RARE_ of living

the marine : head lifted , he strained and called
_RARE_ Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat
his mouth and yelled
the rifle off his shoulder
for all he'd finish this marine who would not die
, but listened
as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese _RARE_ there , Japanese ''
tilted back his head and went through the _RARE_ of drinking from a container
the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct
''

nodded vigorously
, _RARE_ the rifle
was a _RARE_
had said that all marines were _RARE_
slumped forward into a bow like a _RARE_ before an _RARE_
own _RARE_ , Matsuo took out his water bottle
was all he would have ; ; he was very _RARE_ , but he must observe water discipline
of _RARE_ had taught him the value of water discipline
to _RARE_ the bottle , the _RARE_ cap _RARE_ on its _RARE_
, the marine waved both hands and shouted
it was water he really _RARE_ ; ; down in the _RARE_ of the sun he was becoming dried out
shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack
his head
no water for an enemy
this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter _RARE_ to _RARE_ other water if he were to discover some _RARE_ jungle pool
the bottle and replaced it
, he had less reason to desire it than the marine
longer the marine _RARE_ down
slumped
part of his _RARE_ had stained dark

nothing for you '' , Matsuo said
_RARE_ will certainly beat you for your _RARE_ , besides the _RARE_ of it
for you ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the _RARE_
Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China
it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , with the village burning about him and shells _RARE_
back and customers hastily _RARE_ their tables as the tall young _RARE_ _RARE_ pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar
Throat and his gang stayed where they were
was slumped with his back against the bar , _RARE_ supporting his massive frame
at the stranger as the distance between them closed
when did they allow _RARE_ kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys ''

to me I don't remember _RARE_ any law about that ''
up , alert now as the _RARE_ _RARE_ came closer
right here where you are , kid '' , he called
don't aim to have _RARE_ breathing down my neck when I'm _RARE_ '' : The stranger ignored him
stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang _RARE_ right hand was on the butt of his revolver
Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat _RARE_ body ''
what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy ''
I'm asking
the time I get what I ask for ''
winked at his six _RARE_
kid has no manners , boys
teach him some ''
was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster
fist swept over in a _RARE_ right cross and _RARE_ the big _RARE_ on the side of his chin
snapped round and he _RARE_ back , _RARE_ into the table where his _RARE_ were _RARE_
on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him _RARE_ against the bar
_RARE_ into the bar top an inch from _RARE_ stomach as Blue _RARE_ _RARE_ started shooting
himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun
roared twice and two men dropped , _RARE_
shot _RARE_ the light
the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy ''
, George , but I ain't got poor old _RARE_ body yet
aim to have it ''
again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed
off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor
, Tilghman , I'm _RARE_ ''
me '' , said another Blue Throat _RARE_
a light
his partner , George _RARE_ , _RARE_ the men into a corner
now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said
for Pat _RARE_ body ''
minutes the body of _RARE_ former _RARE_ , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling _RARE_ the previous night , was carried into the _RARE_ funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial
, nursing an _RARE_ jaw and a _RARE_ dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the _RARE_ of the fight
_RARE_ will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George _RARE_ , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him
won't stand for this
up the town ''
was correct
James _RARE_ had scarcely completed Pat _RARE_ last _RARE_ on _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , when shots were heard in the distance
'' , said the Reverend _RARE_ , _RARE_ his rifle _RARE_ up against a _RARE_ , `` and now my _RARE_ , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere ''
and his _RARE_ rode off to the battle
, who had ruled the town with his _RARE_ for the last six months , certainly had no intention of _RARE_ his _RARE_ _RARE_
essential that he should _RARE_ his _RARE_ reputation as a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and this was the _RARE_ _RARE_ West method of doing it
in at the head of sixty _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and took over a _RARE_ barn at the entrance to Main Street
length of the street could be _RARE_ with rifle fire from this barn
riding down the street to demand Blue _RARE_ surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire
citizens of _RARE_ had gathered inside _RARE_ _RARE_ , halfway down the street
firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived
up the situation and shook his head
Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all _RARE_ up in here for days '' , he said
only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store ''
the store owner and together they went into the _RARE_
with six sticks of _RARE_
gonna drop these into Blue _RARE_ lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to _RARE_ 'em through the window ''
outside , hugging the walls of buildings and _RARE_ into _RARE_
men spotted him and a _RARE_ of bullets _RARE_ the store _RARE_ and board walk as he passed
away from the barn he _RARE_ inside a _RARE_ shop and came out at the back
couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang
had to do was light the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and _RARE_ the sticks through
did just that
the big barn was _RARE_ into smoking _RARE_ , with every _RARE_ either dead or injured inside
the abrupt end of Blue _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_
slightly injured himself the big _RARE_ never returned to those parts
the incident was just one of a long list of _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ on the side of the law which started in _RARE_ when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet
the _RARE_ _RARE_ tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders
the _RARE_ who survived more _RARE_ than any other famous _RARE_ character in the book
the most action , beat up more _RARE_ with his bare fists , broke up the most _RARE_ and sent more _RARE_ to the _RARE_ than any other U.S. _RARE_ who lived before or after him
years his guns and _RARE_ fists shot holes through and _RARE_ the _RARE_ out of the enemies of law and order in the _RARE_ towns of the West
of _RARE_ western _RARE_ and _RARE_ have been _RARE_ almost to the point of _RARE_ , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his _RARE_ career , his achievements and the _RARE_ _RARE_ he took while _RARE_ the West have remained almost _RARE_
the view that a _RARE_ was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man _RARE_ it regularly over a period of half a century
within an ace of being _RARE_ with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which _RARE_ _RARE_ in the _RARE_
Bill Doolin , these _RARE_ specialized in train _RARE_ but as a _RARE_ they _RARE_ stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns
ambition , it appeared , was to _RARE_ out his name with bullets alongside those of _RARE_ James and Billy the _RARE_ , and Bill Tilghman had _RARE_ he would stop him
that some ranchers were _RARE_ with the Doolin gang
_RARE_ cattle from the _RARE_ , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , _RARE_ his men in their houses
to set an example by _RARE_ one of the ranchers , named Ed _RARE_ , who lived at Rock Fort
bitterly cold day in January , _RARE_ , accompanied only by _RARE_ Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and headed for Rock Fort and _RARE_ ranch
_RARE_ hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside
evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was _RARE_ out thick smoke
_RARE_ halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door
here , _RARE_ '' , said Tilghman
I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse ''
rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and _RARE_ on it
no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside
the door was a _RARE_ log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day
it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed _RARE_
, Ed '' , said Tilghman
grunted an _RARE_ but didn't move
the door behind him and walked towards the fire
saw something which made his big heart give a _RARE_ _RARE_ and caused the hairs to _RARE_ on the back of his neck
side of the room were six _RARE_ _RARE_ , each one _RARE_ off with a _RARE_
_RARE_ through these curtains were the _RARE_ _RARE_ of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman
_RARE_ had walked right into a trap and at any moment six _RARE_ might _RARE_ into his hide
, Tilghman never hesitated for one instant
right up to the fire as though _RARE_ unaware of the guns covering him
behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer
day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually _RARE_ his _RARE_ to the fire
dropped in to ask where Jed _RARE_ lives
to locate _RARE_ in this snow ''
was trembling
look Tilghman in the face
the river for five miles '' , he said _RARE_
_RARE_ is on the south bank ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ himself out of that _RARE_ _RARE_ , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes
time rifle _RARE_ were pointing _RARE_ at his head and body
move on his part and he would be a dead man
'' , he announced , `` _RARE_ I'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the _RARE_ ''
back to the door , _RARE_ softly , hands still _RARE_ behind him
the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable _RARE_ of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive
knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon
showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly
climbed on to the wagon next to _RARE_ Brown
say or do anything '' , he said softly
get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry
is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang ''
he spoke those words Billy _RARE_ life hung on a thread
the house a _RARE_ named Red Buck , _RARE_ because Billy had been allowed to leave _RARE_ , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then
stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle
Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back
him go ''
fighting _RARE_ _RARE_ run of _RARE_ from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , _RARE_ , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice _RARE_
, a _RARE_ _RARE_ officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since
he _RARE_ out of Ma _RARE_ dance hall and proceeded to _RARE_ the peace by shooting off his revolver
months now , Jack _RARE_ , a big _RARE_ boy of fifteen with a _RARE_ , _RARE_ face and _RARE_ _RARE_ eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman
had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she _RARE_ warmth , a sweet warmth ; ; she would talk to him in a _RARE_ voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him _RARE_
would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach
would run to the toilet behind the house
did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him
feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him
never said anything , so he figured it was all right
when Miss Langford came to teach at the _RARE_ _RARE_ school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the _RARE_ face and figure
not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do
awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh
( her first name was _RARE_ ) was an attractive girl
blonde , _RARE_ , fair , _RARE_ without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of _RARE_ _RARE_ as she _RARE_ among the pupils in her fresh , _RARE_ summer dress
beginning to _RARE_ and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ; but if it had been , it had been _RARE_ until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack
look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become _RARE_ and a little sick
in August , the _RARE_ part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very _RARE_ with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get _RARE_ with one another
two or three days they went home early
that is , except Jack
around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened _RARE_ and put the room in order
this was on the third day of school ) she _RARE_ down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare _RARE_ of _RARE_ white leg
for a moment his heart had stopped beating
time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him
back , _RARE_ and ran , _RARE_ , down the hill away from the school
look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ; then he slowed to a walk
became even stronger now
get her yet '' , he muttered to himself
got to get her ''
he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was _RARE_
_RARE_ that morning , and his mother became concerned , _RARE_ as he usually ate heartily
the matter , honey ''
, with the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ woman for her only child
you hungry ''
, I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs
was already hot at _RARE_ A.M. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen
a little sick at his stomach
you sick ''
'' , he said
be all right
it's this hot weather ''
you play hard today then
you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early
the car for me , and I'm going to town this afternoon ''
, I won't play hard '' , he promised
Charles _RARE_ yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the _RARE_ house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' over his shoulder
say , boy ''
, grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth
also fifteen , was tall and skinny , _RARE_ , with straight black hair like an _RARE_ and sharp brown eyes
himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him
know what I done last night ''
as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the _RARE_ _RARE_ , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school
of course that the tale to be _RARE_ would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were _RARE_ only apparent interest
always derived _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ ( even when he suspected his friend of _RARE_ or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now


got _RARE_ _RARE_ in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry ''
imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind
beat faster
you say ''
, _RARE_ into the _RARE_ he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles
you do it ''
, I _RARE_ got on top of -- '' `` No , I mean _RARE_ you get her to do it ''
, I _RARE_ ask her ''
like that ''
, yes
_RARE_ around me a lot here lately , and I _RARE_ I might as _RARE_ try it
heard her old uncle that _RARE_ there has been _RARE_ it ''
never heard that ''
all over _RARE_
get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your _RARE_ ''
might try it one of these days '' , Jack said _RARE_ , thinking of Miss Langford
reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse
, in a fresh white dress and _RARE_ white _RARE_ , without _RARE_ , was out there with them , trying to get them inside
for books '' , she yelled , _RARE_ a little _RARE_ store bell in her right hand
go inside ''
, come on Miss Langford , play with us just _RARE_ '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling _RARE_
, not now '' , said the teacher
at dinner time
now ''
_RARE_ stopped playing then and _RARE_ into the schoolhouse
Miss Langford all morning
think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about _RARE_ _RARE_
would look across the _RARE_ at _RARE_ , fourteen and _RARE_ in a fresh green _RARE_ dress , sitting in the _RARE_ row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did
, remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball
ain't you _RARE_ ball ''
Charles _RARE_ as they sat in the _RARE_ shade , watching the girls _RARE_ in front of the schoolhouse
Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called
_RARE_ stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned
some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress ''
'' , Jack said _RARE_ , watching for Miss Langford
came out of the schoolhouse
appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` _RARE_ , _RARE_ ''
play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and _RARE_ off his overall pants
'' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls
crack the whip a few minutes without _RARE_
Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled _RARE_ , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head
was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` _RARE_ , I'm sorry , Miss Langford
mean to pull so hard ''
all right '' , she said , _RARE_ her head back to get the hair out of her eyes
was my fault ''
hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other
hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet
she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go
you '' , she said , _RARE_ herself off
you play with us again , Miss Langford ''
the little girls said
more today
other day ''
, _RARE_ '' , the girl said
don't believe I'll play any more neither ''
neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone
off alone out the road in the _RARE_ _RARE_ sun , past Robert _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes
came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up
would not work his _RARE_ problems when the teacher held his class
do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be _RARE_ about school work
considered throwing _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand _RARE_ in a corner instead of stay in after school
_RARE_ now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack
I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately
surprise his plan worked perfectly
right , if you can't do your _RARE_ during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling
will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems ''
when the others _RARE_ out that afternoon Jack remained _RARE_ in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a _RARE_ manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home
saw them
was _RARE_ like a mighty _RARE_ and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` How will I do it
_RARE_ of the amused _RARE_ of white _RARE_ stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and _RARE_
little _RARE_ _RARE_ called _RARE_ belly and kept her green , somewhat _RARE_ eyes fixed on a _RARE_ male who was _RARE_ wildly with a _RARE_ _RARE_ snake wrapped around his _RARE_ neck
with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which _RARE_ to the woman
muscular , he had _RARE_ features , and his light color told of the European _RARE_ who had been intimate with the slave women of his family
white girl turned to a distinguished , _RARE_ man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , _RARE_ _RARE_
almost time for and _RARE_ to begin ''
_RARE_ was one of New _RARE_ most important and _RARE_ slave owners
and gave the signal for the dance to start
ran _RARE_ to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a _RARE_ youth they called _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ two _RARE_ _RARE_ bones against the _RARE_ which served as his _RARE_
his _RARE_ _RARE_ of teeth and _RARE_ _RARE_ , his brass _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ as he shook and _RARE_ in _RARE_
_RARE_ the _RARE_ with frantic intensity as the _RARE_ began the _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ which had long been a favorite of _RARE_ _RARE_ and their _RARE_ in the _RARE_ slave compounds

girl with the _RARE_ green eyes _RARE_ the _RARE_ handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had _RARE_ skin and _RARE_ eyebrows
_RARE_ in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was _RARE_ after a fashion and _RARE_ the manners of his owners
wore the blue _RARE_ of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the _RARE_ _RARE_ and most _RARE_ names
a _RARE_ in high society
a top _RARE_ and one of the city's most _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a _RARE_ , a _RARE_ and _RARE_ mad -- the _RARE_ of some of the worst _RARE_ against _RARE_ ever committed on American soil
_RARE_ with her riding _RARE_ toward the _RARE_ youth who was _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the _RARE_ snake still _RARE_ over his bare shoulders
, handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves
_RARE_ with animal _RARE_ and a _RARE_ _RARE_ for women of any race
had had little experience with girls on his _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ St. John
actually , he avoided _RARE_ _RARE_ and seemed truly _RARE_ of the _RARE_ desires when they sought to make _RARE_ with him in the open fields , in _RARE_ and in _RARE_
slave was therefore quite _RARE_ when Delphine Lalaurie _RARE_ that she wanted him to draw near
eyed the youth with the _RARE_ a coin _RARE_ might display toward a rare _RARE_ which is not yet in his collection
is your name , boy
bit closer
_RARE_ , you know ''
at Madame Lalaurie and _RARE_ the Paris perfume which _RARE_ from her
smiled _RARE_
name is Dandy Brandon , _RARE_
to _RARE_ Alexander Prieur ''
with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms
quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy ''
impatiently _RARE_ the slave toward her waiting carriage
_RARE_ , she climbed in , never _RARE_ her grip on his arm
seemed utterly _RARE_ of the snake which _RARE_ on the floor in a _RARE_
the _RARE_ _RARE_ , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army _RARE_
last , and after a few _RARE_ _RARE_ on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her _RARE_ driver
the big man with the _RARE_ air and the _RARE_ , _RARE_ eyebrows

you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase
in gold in this _RARE_ _RARE_
old fool _RARE_ about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer
_RARE_ and depends on _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
he _RARE_ 300 slaves
shouldn't matter to him ''
, the _RARE_ _RARE_ who had been brought in _RARE_ years before from his native _RARE_ _RARE_ , smiled _RARE_ and touched his _RARE_ _RARE_ hat
eyes _RARE_ the woman , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner
youth , Madame ''
said softly
one is a tender chicken , _RARE_
beauty , such fine flesh
_RARE_ and _RARE_ easily for Madame ''
quiet , _RARE_
_RARE_ your place ''
_RARE_ walked off _RARE_ in search of Alexander Prieur
took the reins in her _RARE_ hands and drove Dandy Brandon -- _RARE_ in the back seat of the carriage -- to her _RARE_ at _RARE_ _RARE_ Street
Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the _RARE_ _RARE_
curiosity _RARE_ his _RARE_ , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle
a _RARE_ man with a _RARE_ _RARE_ beard and an unusually large head
wore a _RARE_ smoking jacket , and his _RARE_ eyes were _RARE_ and _RARE_ behind thick _RARE_ _RARE_
about 50 years old
young man , my dear
you are most _RARE_ to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with _RARE_
her cheek for a kiss , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ it like a _RARE_ _RARE_
is to be our house guest , Louis
the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual _RARE_ , quite _RARE_ in many ways
a better life than just _RARE_ away on the Prieur _RARE_ ''
so , my dear
will be ready shortly ''
led the horses to the stable after a _RARE_ glance at the _RARE_ slave
been older or _RARE_ , _RARE_ might have warned him that he would be well advised to _RARE_ from the _RARE_ tender care if he _RARE_ his life
liked the smell of _RARE_ perfume
her _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth
he was weary of _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_
Brandon _RARE_ entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and _RARE_ up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home
_RARE_ though it was , the attic represented _RARE_ to a slave who had led a _RARE_ life with six brothers and sisters and _RARE_ relatives in a _RARE_ at _RARE_ St. John
_RARE_ on the _RARE_ bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than _RARE_
just as well that the _RARE_ Dandy enjoyed himself to the _RARE_ that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell
finally left the sinister _RARE_ on _RARE_ Street , he was carried out in a _RARE_ basket
weeks after Dandy _RARE_ arrival at the _RARE_ , the little surgeon and his _RARE_ young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ families were invited
orchestra played softly behind the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and Delphine _RARE_ _RARE_ among her guests , _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ races , the latest _RARE_ from Paris , and _RARE_ politics
was a _RARE_ upstairs , a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ and died as the _RARE_ and guests _RARE_ at an _RARE_ _RARE_ the marble staircase
Dandy Brandon , _RARE_ only in a _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ as if the devil were breathing hard on him
once _RARE_ body was a mass of scars and _RARE_
face showed the _RARE_ of _RARE_
pointed an _RARE_ finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` _RARE_ woman
this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home ''
the last words he ever _RARE_
he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ shirt and _RARE_ the politician wore
Lalaurie examined the _RARE_ form of the slave on the _RARE_ dance floor and pronounced him dead
broke up in confusion
with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made _RARE_ _RARE_
like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the _RARE_ corpse
the _RARE_ _RARE_ Delphine told a _RARE_ story
saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square _RARE_ and felt sorry for him
our hope to _RARE_ him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest
paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night
returned in such a _RARE_ condition , or why , I cannot say
and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs ''
at her swimming eyes with a _RARE_ handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy
have fallen in with evil _RARE_ , for he was a simple youth and quite _RARE_ and _RARE_
have robbed and _RARE_ him before bringing him back to our house to die
_RARE_ end ''
_RARE_ dying words about the woman troubled the _RARE_ panel , _RARE_ _RARE_ was _RARE_ an _RARE_ by the jury and _RARE_
were at the top _RARE_ of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel _RARE_ to doubt the _RARE_ of so _RARE_ a lady
_RARE_ slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting _RARE_ testimony , _RARE_ her and the doctor back into the _RARE_
life went its _RARE_ way -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , balls and dinners
over _RARE_ _RARE_ death _RARE_ and Madame _RARE_ stock _RARE_ when she resumed her _RARE_ _RARE_ of visiting the poor and bringing _RARE_ and comfort to _RARE_ patients in the county hospital
on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set _RARE_ to _RARE_ at a _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ , socially prominent and a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and _RARE_ an amazing sight
_RARE_ and his _RARE_ , Delphine Lalaurie , were _RARE_ a young girl -- an _RARE_ of _RARE_ beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie _RARE_
was not more than 16
nude to the waist and her tumbled _RARE_ of black hair did not _RARE_ the knife _RARE_ on her back
girl was _RARE_ fast ; ; the _RARE_ and Delphine were _RARE_ on her as she raced down _RARE_ Street
cried out in an _RARE_ _RARE_ voice : `` _RARE_ me , somebody
pulled out all my teeth and now she will _RARE_ out my tongue with her _RARE_
'' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that _RARE_ stuff , and the first chair _RARE_ me ''
, and since the pure grain had gotten him _RARE_ from every decent -- and even _RARE_ -- group from _RARE_ Village to the _RARE_ , he had become a _RARE_ _RARE_
ain't _RARE_ faster , or _RARE_ , or more direct than a _RARE_ freight when you _RARE_ go _RARE_ '' , Feathertop would say
_RARE_ may not be the _RARE_ , but man
nobody _RARE_ for your ticket _RARE_ , neither ''
been _RARE_ the _RARE_ for a long , long time now
the _RARE_ , and the trouble with the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ and the child
all that
been a very long time that had no form and no end
-- as he told himself in the _RARE_ of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out
out and never to return again
day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been _RARE_
the day it ended
car was cold , early in the morning
pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay _RARE_ , the rattling and _RARE_ of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his _RARE_
his _RARE_ away from his body , and the little sweet _RARE_ _RARE_ neatly and _RARE_ as he _RARE_ its _RARE_
slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ; at first _RARE_ , caught by _RARE_ of corn -- then with a _RARE_ into its _RARE_
lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor
her legs up under her , to rise , her full _RARE_ skirt drawing up her _RARE_ , and _RARE_ music _RARE_ away
that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner
thing , but the right _RARE_ for the action that counted
that was the word , hot
a _RARE_ _RARE_ wings , with the sun shining down over them
, yet
for the _RARE_ neck , the full , high _RARE_ , the _RARE_ waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however

boy _RARE_ himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting
less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight
, high _RARE_ , wide _RARE_ mouth , a pair of _RARE_ _RARE_ hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can _RARE_ you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished
made it , Cappy '' , the _RARE_ said
, seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close
''
, standing up , _RARE_ the pig _RARE_ from his dirty pants
of that
a respectable house here ''
and saw him , standing there dim in the _RARE_ light from the _RARE_ freight wall
big , and _RARE_ , and his toes stuck out of the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his shoes
the black plastic _RARE_ lightly
sit '' , said Feathertop , _RARE_ them toward him
_RARE_ is _RARE_ over here ''
smiled , and started forward
_RARE_ her back hard , _RARE_ her off her feet , and gathered her into the _RARE_ of his arm
stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped _RARE_
_RARE_ to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do
know this guy ''
, square bit '' , Feathertop _RARE_ his face up
was strictly from _RARE_

is with this _RARE_ jazz ''
, _RARE_ against the _RARE_ _RARE_ wall
-- we _RARE_ '' , Cappy said
came up and he said it _RARE_
, _RARE_ ''
an elaborate motion with his hand
were going to be easy _RARE_
have much dough , but then none of the _RARE_ Feathertop rolled had much
, the _RARE_ had a little something the others didn't have
gonna be fun collecting
just yet
a _RARE_
to _RARE_ his meat before he tasted it
sit '' , he repeated , _RARE_ to the piled hay _RARE_ , over the pig _RARE_
just a poor _RARE_ man , name of -- _RARE_ -- _RARE_ Smith ''
at them _RARE_
ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused
you know -- you're right ''
a finger at him
, come on , Cappy '' , the girl _RARE_
okay
nice guy ''
to move toward the hay _RARE_ , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her
the smooth _RARE_ of her _RARE_ , _RARE_ legs as she walked to the _RARE_ , and _RARE_ them beneath her , _RARE_ the skirt out in a wide circle
his throat ; ; it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within _RARE_ distance
it all _RARE_ , of course
kid , _RARE_ his dough -- at least enough to get to _RARE_ -- and then have a _RARE_ ball with the _RARE_
_RARE_
you come from , Mr. -- _RARE_ -- Mr. Smith ''
politely
from ''


riding train for a ways now ''
into silence , and the freight _RARE_ up a hill , _RARE_ down the other side , shaking and _RARE_ to itself
while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into _RARE_ , honey ''
the matter , she _RARE_ go the bathroom ''
it _RARE_ funny
_RARE_ at him , and the girl looked shocked

, I mean , no that isn't what I said ''
at him
only said I was hungry
had anything to eat all day ''
Feathertop Ernie _RARE_ voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a _RARE_ carpet bag , with leather _RARE_
_RARE_ say so , fellow _RARE_
we got dinner right here
buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two ''
_RARE_ , but he moved off the _RARE_ and followed the dirty _RARE_ to the center of the _RARE_ boxcar
and opened the carpet bag
out a small _RARE_ filled with _RARE_ of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and _RARE_ folded piece of tin foil with holes in it
the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot
charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
it '' , he told Cappy , _RARE_ him a sheet of newspaper
, but _RARE_ we gonna eat

'' , Ernie _RARE_ a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my _RARE_ patience ''
once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of _RARE_
dogs , man
greatest , but they stick to your belly _RARE_ ''
down the _RARE_ carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil
they began to _RARE_
up and grinned
_RARE_ _RARE_ '' , he explained
_RARE_ ''
had licked the last of the _RARE_ taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette
, Ernie thought , too bad
come you're riding the _RARE_ , kids like you ''

down at his wide hands , and did not reply
, _RARE_ face came up and she said , `` My father
want us to get married
ran away ''
didn't he want you to get _RARE_ ''
even she did not answer
down at her hands , too
few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy
my fault ''
came around sharply
fault , hell
all my fault
been careful it never _RARE_ '' -- he stopped abruptly
went up
the matter ''
still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant ''
at himself
he was stupid , her old man
heard _RARE_ like it : _RARE_ gonna go have an _RARE_ , and _RARE_ gonna go away to a _RARE_ , and _RARE_ this and _RARE_ that like he was _RARE_ or _RARE_ , _RARE_ ''

a slightly different matter
_RARE_ , and the child
had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about
before the white _RARE_ and the _RARE_ had turned him inside out
kids weren't like him

, _RARE_ out of it , old son
just another couple of characters to roll
got , you get
all this other
drink ''
, taking the pint of sweet _RARE_ from his jacket pocket

you offer ''
came from the open door of the boxcar
man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade
at the man
big
, with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a _RARE_
, Ernie thought
gonna give me a drink , _RARE_ ''
man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar
a moment
could break him in half
'' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips
down _RARE_ of the strong _RARE_ and _RARE_ the remainder
stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden _RARE_
the bottle with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and making sucking _RARE_ with his thick lips , drained it completely
his head back , closed his eyes , and _RARE_ _RARE_
again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door
, now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket
didn't know I was gonna have company in this car ''
going to _RARE_ '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more
, I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final _RARE_ for Ernie
suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it
you and me will , _RARE_ , but these two ain't goin' nowhere ''
on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car
screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me
stalked toward them , and Kitty _RARE_ back , her hand to her mouth
split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard
hit the bigger man with an _RARE_ _RARE_
him backward in a _RARE_ _RARE_
down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but _RARE_ arms and legs
showed for an instant , and his arm was _RARE_ back
went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` _RARE_ ''
were _RARE_ again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious _RARE_
the knife _RARE_ an instant -- an instant enough to press the _RARE_
came out with a _RARE_
the knife _RARE_ , and drew back to _RARE_ it into the kid's throat
_RARE_ and her face was white
at _RARE_ sleeve and _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ him

''
liked nor disliked the Old Man
he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after _RARE_ , and at noon , and at six each evening -- its tone , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , never breaking the boredom of the streets
Man was _RARE_
he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees _RARE_ against the screen door in early June ; ; or the smell of thick _RARE_ _RARE_ -- the _RARE_ smell that was both sweet and _RARE_ -- rising up from aluminum _RARE_ wrapped in _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ sounds of _RARE_ at night , when their black bodies _RARE_ into the _RARE_ above and below the _RARE_ street lights
bay of female dogs in heat
called him by name , although he had one
, that's what he was called in the old country ; ; but here he was just _RARE_ or the Old Man
was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its _RARE_
when commanded
to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession
asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing
thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened
past was dead here as the present was dead
Old Man had had a wife
she , too , ignored him
tiny _RARE_ wrapped around her shoulders , she _RARE_ her _RARE_ _RARE_ down the street before him and didn't stop
hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase
she _RARE_ down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both
at him , without looking at anything except _RARE_ Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange _RARE_ , rode away in it , and never came back
she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said
, no
one
she was bigger than we are because she came from _RARE_ ''
, _RARE_
herself _RARE_ _RARE_
she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours ''
slapped their _RARE_
not for making pretty speeches about _RARE_ those _RARE_ get paid so good ''
''
, _RARE_ only by the _RARE_ of polished _RARE_ , had swayed excitedly beneath _RARE_ _RARE_ where tiny black hairs _RARE_ , never to be _RARE_ away
that had never known anything _RARE_ than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again
''
the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a _RARE_
enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the _RARE_ _RARE_ of a woman he had _RARE_ -- watching her become _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the distance , as thin as the _RARE_ on her _RARE_ , and still _RARE_
had not commanded her to stop
not questioned why
said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ; but he might have been _RARE_ away the _RARE_ that _RARE_ from his yellow dog onto him
was never without that dog
his eyes -- those _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction
_RARE_ very soul could have left him and _RARE_ down that street , but he wouldn't have had anyone know it
had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife
he called for his _RARE_ , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that _RARE_
to be a _RARE_ purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to _RARE_ Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him
he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the _RARE_ of _RARE_
have been _RARE_ or _RARE_ for the way it smelled
it matter to him that the park at the foot of _RARE_ Road stretched beneath _RARE_ _RARE_ that roared from the _RARE_ station into the city's center at _RARE_ intervals
the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the _RARE_
was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his _RARE_
they were one and the same
the Old Man was framed in by a wall of _RARE_ trees which divided these quarters from the city
the streets with _RARE_ houses the color of _RARE_
the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden _RARE_
with the _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the _RARE_ _RARE_ of screen doors
_RARE_ , which _RARE_ nothing now but the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , had a lawn before it
coffee shop on _RARE_ Street , where the men spent their _RARE_ and _RARE_ playing cards , had a rose _RARE_ beneath its window
_RARE_ of coffee _RARE_ thrown against it
house on the street had no lawn before it
low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron _RARE_ supporting a glass _RARE_
_RARE_ shop
, from a _RARE_ _RARE_ , wooden angels _RARE_ the neighborhood
Old Man remember them there
else _RARE_ was _RARE_ and wood in square blocks -- like _RARE_ _RARE_ against the _RARE_ of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery
_RARE_ _RARE_ through the walls of those _RARE_ into the mysterious core of _RARE_ behind the houses where _RARE_ owned no _RARE_ , where one man's property _RARE_ with the next to form _RARE_ in which no one knew privacy
hatred and fear were one here , _RARE_ only by _RARE_ trees and _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ tongue of _RARE_ licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch
Man silently fed upon these streets
him alive , waiting
what and for whom , only he could tell and would not
as though he had made a _RARE_ with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price
holding out for something
determined to hold out
_RARE_ son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the _RARE_ of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich
he didn't care that he had no mother , that he couldn't remember her face or her touch ; ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him
named _RARE_ as a tribute to his _RARE_ , and he couldn't have cared less about that either
life was a _RARE_ boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep
would be a man , he would be a rich man
not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in _RARE_ houses on the other side of the park
not ride the _RARE_ local to the city each morning
not carry a brief case
he work at all
square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step
sit inside the coffee shop and pound a _RARE_ fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , _RARE_ with her running , calling out in her _RARE_ , `` At your service ''
order her to bring coffee , and would take from his _RARE_ pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not remove his _RARE_ -- and light and smoke
do that when he would be a man
, Laura ''
to his sister on the porch above the steps
only ten months older than he
, what would you say if I smoked a pipe ''
not answer him
_RARE_ against the broken porch fence , _RARE_ and drying her wet , _RARE_ hair in the sun
leg _RARE_ the _RARE_ and swung loosely before the _RARE_ , torn _RARE_
foot , whose _RARE_ swept high and white , pointed _RARE_ toward _RARE_ toes -- toes like fingers , whose tips _RARE_ white
while she sat there , her _RARE_ arms _RARE_ before her chest
showed no sign of having heard _RARE_
a face that had lost its _RARE_ _RARE_ and was beginning to _RARE_ within its _RARE_ features a _RARE_ that _RARE_ the _RARE_ lines of its contours
, blue and always somewhat _RARE_ , possessed a sullen quality
the boy could not see them , he knew they were _RARE_ by distance
never sure they fully took him in
again , `` Laura ''
only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it
in a mood '' , he thought `` There's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood ''
what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about
for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him
Laura
was interrupted in his _RARE_ by a warm _RARE_ _RARE_ against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a _RARE_ _RARE_ tongue , _RARE_ against the salt taste of him
tongue , an _RARE_ yellow eye , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ within a sphere of _RARE_ pink skin , stared _RARE_ at him
sake , _RARE_ , _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ would not
boiling milk , ain't you ''
with his hand , knowing the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the swollen _RARE_ of _RARE_ that wrinkled _RARE_ to his touch
over
_RARE_ gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those _RARE_
mouth opened wide , he _RARE_ the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue _RARE_ the light , _RARE_ taste of it
fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a _RARE_ player , pressing and pulling , _RARE_ in what he did
slid the _RARE_ shadow of a storm cloud
was a heavy figure in a _RARE_ _RARE_
boy could see only the _RARE_ belly
Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something _RARE_ in it
it was there , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow _RARE_ back
be time enough , perhaps the Old Man _RARE_ himself , to pay the devil his due
to give up his soul
_RARE_ , six _RARE_ , stained an _RARE_ , the same color as _RARE_ shaved hair , _RARE_ up close to him
they made on the concrete interrupted him in the _RARE_ pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the _RARE_ and _RARE_ to be _RARE_ its _RARE_ for _RARE_
at a glance that the _RARE_ _RARE_ belonged to _RARE_ , the _RARE_ ones to _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ ones to _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ brother
_RARE_ small body to sink closer and closer to the ground
_RARE_ thin hand to reach down to _RARE_ the boy , and her shrill , _RARE_ voice to sound against the _RARE_ of his _RARE_ flesh that was never sure of hearing anything
in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it
filled with smoke , and _RARE_ head _RARE_ with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to _RARE_ it
rapidly _RARE_ her mother in recovery
months she became a fat highly social baby , with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ hair all over her head
flying into _RARE_ and started _RARE_ her food ; ; she developed a _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ and a _RARE_ _RARE_ , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her
so heavy that _RARE_ arms shook from _RARE_ her and taking care of her
seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be _RARE_ through the _RARE_ old _RARE_ and _RARE_ out and _RARE_ back ; ; there was the daily round of household _RARE_ in which Maggie insisted on participating
a great deal to do with it ; ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him
would have preferred death and _RARE_ to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his _RARE_ _RARE_ , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and _RARE_ and soap , just plain soap
Stuart _RARE_ over figures every night , trying to find how they could _RARE_ out a few _RARE_ more
Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon : `` Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ''
seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , Eugenia said
been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again
have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something '' , Maggie said
would make me feel a lot better , but the _RARE_ _RARE_ isn't taking _RARE_ goods any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery ''
should think so '' , Eugenia said
one thing you can stop keeping that child in _RARE_ dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day ''
so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice ''

up the baby and _RARE_ her fat warm little neck
be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be _RARE_ '' , Eugenia said
Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a _RARE_ _RARE_ until it was nine months old ''
Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in New York , and I'm sick and tired of hearing about _RARE_ Mae Evans ''
now , Maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , Eugenia said
just thinking of a way for you to be _RARE_ ''
sorry
seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money ''
, let's see
a list of your assets ''
laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop , and she kept on laughing while she _RARE_ the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining
came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope _RARE_ down words and figures
have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working _RARE_ '' , Eugenia said
could put up _RARE_ on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a _RARE_ where it's nice and _RARE_ , but of course it would _RARE_ quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that ''
else ''
might set up a dress shop in the living room ''
woman in the block has tried that ''
about a tea room , then
set up tables in the front room and serve _RARE_ and your _RARE_ _RARE_ and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a _RARE_ and tell _RARE_ ''
too elaborate
isn't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I ''

, `` Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you don't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra _RARE_ jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough ''
, I'm sure I could do that '' , Maggie said
it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you ''
worry , I can get plenty more '' , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could
looking much _RARE_ already , clearing a space on the table and _RARE_ about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be _RARE_ up on her _RARE_ so Eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it
then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time
can go back to my _RARE_ and be thinking while I'm doing the washing ''
are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything ''

, `` Oh Eugenia , I wish '' `` What ''
wish I had three wishes '' , Maggie said
of them for you ''
bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the _RARE_ of _RARE_ numbers of people
dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days
settled like a tangible _RARE_ over the _RARE_ _RARE_ City , _RARE_ it in an icy grip that _RARE_ its _RARE_ and altered its physical appearance ; ; it had a look of grim _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ other cities whose _RARE_ climate was cold , instead of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ Western city _RARE_ in eternal _RARE_ at the foot of mountains stored with endless _RARE_ and resources
huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in _RARE_ , in relief lines , outside government agencies
facilities to take care of them ; ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities
of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created _RARE_ with their stock markets and their _RARE_ _RARE_ and their _RARE_ _RARE_ of industries , protected by _RARE_ freight rates
was _RARE_ supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay
offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold _RARE_ everything
people talked and argued ; ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate _RARE_ and something had to be done
to be done ; ; it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government
to be done
said it to each other a dozen times a day
to be done about the _RARE_ , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and _RARE_ bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half _RARE_ , for _RARE_ , for clothes , for the new _RARE_ in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor _RARE_ that came up once , twice , fifty times a day
the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was _RARE_ a major _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ fuel like a giant _RARE_ _RARE_ that had to be _RARE_ by _RARE_ tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold
in the _RARE_ cracks that seemed to have _RARE_ up , under doors , around _RARE_ window _RARE_ , from the sleeping _RARE_ , the attic , from the _RARE_ cracks between _RARE_ on the roof
had to give up running the _RARE_ at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the _RARE_ and an electric heater in _RARE_ room
so cold and so _RARE_ that a sort of desperate _RARE_ _RARE_ all of them , like people _RARE_ or _RARE_ or caught in some other _RARE_ of circumstance so that time stood still and minor _RARE_ fell away and the only important thing was to _RARE_ together and survive
burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their _RARE_ while they _RARE_ the _RARE_
mainly in the kitchen ; ; they moved _RARE_ bed and the baby's basket there , and the rest of them _RARE_ by the stove and ran _RARE_ and shivering to the upper _RARE_ regions and plunged into icy beds
it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to
said a _RARE_ '' , Eugenia said grimly
being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the _RARE_ of poverty wearing thin
to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to _RARE_ in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever
of people are poor all their lives ''
of people haven't our brains and talent ''
know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , Maggie said
working up to something , and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the _RARE_ family is superior to everything , even a depression ''
only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it '' , Eugenia said
Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord _RARE_ it to be of _RARE_ than it would have to be that way
want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater
hear of it , and she took the heater back to _RARE_ room , and Grandma took it back to _RARE_ room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma _RARE_ it over and almost set her _RARE_ on fire
that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a _RARE_ without anybody knowing it
her of deliberately _RARE_ the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in
of her to use it up
a case like this , but '' -- `` You can joke

God's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about _RARE_ , and he took the sealed envelope from its _RARE_ , wondering why he had preserved it

_RARE_ the -- _RARE_ ''
an old clay pot , _RARE_ of _RARE_ days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little _RARE_ to flame , watching it _RARE_ , the red _RARE_ wax melting and _RARE_ in the _RARE_ _RARE_

hadn't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr. Robards
it was that he could give her this handsome house and _RARE_ _RARE_ as to its beautiful _RARE_ , and fail her in -- spiritual ways
-- far more _RARE_ than his manner of speaking , which he made only _RARE_ effort to change -- was his _RARE_ to that old horse of _RARE_
, rather
_RARE_ now , oh my yes , indeed , yes
her `` the _RARE_ '' much as Mrs. _RARE_ spoke of `` the _RARE_ , God _RARE_ her ''
with fifteen or twenty horses or _RARE_ or _RARE_ or _RARE_ out there in the barn , was _RARE_ only of `` the _RARE_ '' , `` the _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , the _RARE_ Gunny
first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this _RARE_ without price _RARE_ _RARE_ around in her stall
had happened
tried to _RARE_ her
Mr. Robards said , just a _RARE_ anyway
back , Miss Jen , she's _RARE_ of your _RARE_ ''
`` _RARE_ that , you _RARE_ devil ''
for his wife's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January
_RARE_ Gunny whose _RARE_ was due then too
hours to his _RARE_ that the war and `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his _RARE_ of _RARE_ for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it
so much that was _RARE_ -- Tolley , the indifference with which the _RARE_ and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than _RARE_ to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her _RARE_ swollen stomach
was no _RARE_ to Mr. Robards
a fine _RARE_ and could get here quick , he suggested
to having Dr. _RARE_ , a former _RARE_ , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her
were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure
be in the barn , or riding for the _RARE_
night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with _RARE_ of expensive _RARE_ , _RARE_ over her _RARE_ _RARE_ as the cook did over _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house
the dear baby came , he had _RARE_ over here in a _RARE_ , and was as _RARE_ and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been
now that she had had Dr. _RARE_ , feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into _RARE_
something not nice about _RARE_ , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted , saying , `` You don't see _RARE_ _RARE_ down the _RARE_ _RARE_ day , Miss Jen , _RARE_
up _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ '' _RARE_ for her mother , she said firmly , _RARE_ , for herself , and -- `` _RARE_ , for Miss _RARE_ '' , he suggested
was mighty good to you past times , an' _RARE_ _RARE_ her ''
must be thinking of a _RARE_ , something special
till she saw the _RARE_ _RARE_
in all Kentucky
, up on his legs when he was an hour old
_RARE_ Robards
don't you name him Jesus Christ
burst into tears
deeply _RARE_
no idea how unhappy his sweet _RARE_ had been
she wasn't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it
a good idea why not
`` At _RARE_ '' cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all _RARE_ up , hadn't brought many _RARE_ in two whole months
and Miss _RARE_ had come
Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his _RARE_ _RARE_ last year , saying how much she enjoyed her _RARE_ house in town in _RARE_ weather , was looking forward to _RARE_ _RARE_ this summer
an idea
had been right _RARE_ ever since they were married , though you'd have thought a _RARE_ would have brought her round
she'd come to see them once , left silver _RARE_ _RARE_ for all of the trips
Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss _RARE_ couldn't have been very _RARE_ , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there
more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to _RARE_ and Nick's -- his own old square frame box on _RARE_ , chickens and cats and _RARE_ under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a _RARE_ over the babies dressed like _RARE_
was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the _RARE_ house in the land , too
him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss _RARE_ had given him , to be told by Miss _RARE_ that her _RARE_ _RARE_ was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she _RARE_ it , they would be unable to _RARE_ Mrs. Robards and the children
they were well
tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those _RARE_ _RARE_ , and she really took a fit
ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame
a party an' leave 'em out , _RARE_ '' , he suggested
_RARE_ party , send an _RARE_ to _RARE_ but them -- those folks you met at the _RARE_ House , the ones I've got to know in this new _RARE_ Club affair , the whole _RARE_ neighborhood
_RARE_ -- couple _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in a crowd any time
word gets round ''
you dare
Jen was funny that way , funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and _RARE_ up
_RARE_ worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try
surprised when _RARE_ _RARE_ stopped beside her on the _RARE_ one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that _RARE_ _RARE_ had had a call to _RARE_ in some mountain town
-- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to _RARE_ in , and he'd give her a lift to _RARE_
was only _RARE_ and she hoped he didn't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on
for yourself , Miss _RARE_
take a minute ''
in through his own wide _RARE_
the _RARE_ _RARE_ you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty _RARE_
the sight of a friendly face
won't care your _RARE_ , will she ''
of course not '' , _RARE_ said _RARE_
must have _RARE_ me '' , Henrietta murmured to the room
of Doaty's last will and _RARE_ was proof enough of that ; ; Doaty would never have left her house to a _RARE_ woman
herself _RARE_ an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the _RARE_ , sorry note and her best _RARE_ pin
had guessed already and kept her _RARE_
, It's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us
been more to know about _RARE_ , inevitably , and most of it _RARE_
the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently _RARE_
would have been quite _RARE_ without _RARE_ _RARE_ for drama , especially through the long summers
, in the city , there had been the _RARE_ School , which taught _RARE_ with a kind of _RARE_ passion for knowledge ; ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish _RARE_ with a really profound _RARE_ for his pupils ; ; there had been the dancing class -- Miss _RARE_ , thin and _RARE_ , with her _RARE_ _RARE_ and her _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_
been supper parties and _RARE_ , _RARE_ and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , the sun around which the _RARE_ planets _RARE_
died before the _RARE_ of the family circle , the _RARE_ of Charles
safe to assume that Papa , _RARE_ heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was _RARE_ this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in _RARE_ hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know
_RARE_ ; ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her
would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta
always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice
this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty's bed -- she found herself _RARE_ how others might regard her
would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice
on her side , finding the idea _RARE_
had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him
imagine _RARE_ feeling so about anyone
, no _RARE_
, no virtue
thought to end a curious night
were really awake now in a _RARE_ of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching _RARE_ and door , table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers in their artificial _RARE_ and _RARE_
else , she would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden
wait upon this mission , this _RARE_ duty of a _RARE_ whose nature avoided _RARE_
her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls
always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray
sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window
below was _RARE_ with _RARE_ and enchanting in its small _RARE_
, she could see a _RARE_ of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , one not quite come to _RARE_ , one just beyond it
_RARE_ spray thick with _RARE_ and _RARE_ and swelling pink _RARE_ , like a summer _RARE_ , a bird balanced and _RARE_ , _RARE_ brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song
so pretty and _RARE_ that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out _RARE_ to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was _RARE_ not a child but _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ certain age
neat and _RARE_ , she dressed quite _RARE_ and went downstairs
_RARE_ , was not yet up and about , _RARE_ that _RARE_ was human
toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday _RARE_ and milk in a white _RARE_ , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going _RARE_
the garden , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , yielded a _RARE_ _RARE_ of _RARE_ , sweet _RARE_ , _RARE_ stock and _RARE_ _RARE_ , which she tied with long _RARE_ and took back to show _RARE_ , who was now stirring about the kitchen and _RARE_ _RARE_
came _RARE_ to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , _RARE_ the air with _RARE_ _RARE_
her _RARE_ out of reach and said it was for Doaty
in the _RARE_ '' , said _RARE_ coldly
change your shoes before you turn around ''
so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta _RARE_ her under the clear impression that she could either _RARE_ or stay home
, eager for whatever lay beyond the door
_RARE_ , there was only one church
_RARE_ just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea
first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its _RARE_ shops just stirring and its inhabitants _RARE_ her with the _RARE_ curiosity
and _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child
some of the _RARE_ were _RARE_ , but all were interested
man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than _RARE_ look as she passed , the _RARE_ still plainly rising in his branches
impulse , she turned back and said good morning
his ear and shook his head at her repetition , _RARE_ in a _RARE_ way that he had heard her the first time
offered his own estimate of the weather , which was _RARE_
been slow to come '' , he said
my _RARE_ out time ''
at her flowers
taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of _RARE_
be _RARE_ me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so _RARE_ they plan
of 'em in their _RARE_ before I choose my own _RARE_
myself out that does it ''
her with rising hope
like to hear how I go about it ''
nice of you '' , Henrietta said _RARE_
welcome ''
himself , _RARE_ against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots
_RARE_ to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a _RARE_ for _RARE_ the _RARE_ aspects of his text
month , _RARE_ three days '' , he said _RARE_ , `` I take no water into my system , no water _RARE_
the tissues ''
that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her _RARE_ good sense
the tissues '' , he said , `` and _RARE_ the system
did it , and he lived to a great age ''
up at her sharply
remember , do you ''
suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old _RARE_ , who must have been in his _RARE_ when Henrietta ran away
the _RARE_ , _RARE_ had owned the island most , and she and _RARE_ had often stood in front of him , _RARE_ by his terrible years -- a _RARE_ man with a thin beard and very _RARE_ blue eyes like a _RARE_ , more _RARE_ than possible
never spoken once to the _RARE_ sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a _RARE_ captain and powerful like the sea
be that son who sat before her now , _RARE_ to half his size and half his _RARE_
gently , `` Of course I remember you ''
so _RARE_ I remember you '' , he said
the young _RARE_ woman
on a black night with a _RARE_ _RARE_ man
all about you ''
do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed
blame a man for _RARE_ his wife '' , he said quite _RARE_
mine many a time , only she never knew it
a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit
in that ''
'' , said Henrietta _RARE_
a short hard laugh and looked at her _RARE_
be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws
this old man's _RARE_ was even less to her taste than _RARE_ _RARE_ open _RARE_
she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , _RARE_ or condemned
come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow
to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a _RARE_ , _RARE_ figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress
vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man
not had your breakfast yet , _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ is no breakfast '' , he said
and _RARE_ ''
the air with his stick , and it fell from his _RARE_ and _RARE_ on the _RARE_
_RARE_ today '' , his _RARE_ said wearily , and bent to pick it up
got this idea about drying out '' `` It ain't an idea ''
it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water ''
_RARE_ to heaven and said , `` _RARE_ don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious _RARE_ of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she _RARE_ him his _RARE_ of _RARE_
sighed

the _RARE_

now ''
a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , _RARE_ , with the gentle _RARE_ and necessary _RARE_ that the young show toward the very old
at her but let himself be led off inside the house , _RARE_ _RARE_ to make it clear how weak and _RARE_ he was and how he was _RARE_ about by those who still had their _RARE_ strength
a _RARE_ of voices from _RARE_ , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of _RARE_ from the old man
down at her _RARE_ , still _RARE_ with its color and _RARE_ , and set her feet on their _RARE_ way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , _RARE_ dancing ahead of her
edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , _RARE_ with fat round _RARE_ like sheep
covered with tiny white _RARE_ , their _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ at the _RARE_ ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the _RARE_ and cry
was full of sounds too but _RARE_ ones , a _RARE_ humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky
_RARE_ , walking , and almost easy until the church _RARE_ told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty
and _RARE_ were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had _RARE_ while she was gone away ) but the _RARE_ had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' seemed suddenly impossible
down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with _RARE_ , her fingers tracing the _RARE_ _RARE_ letters _RARE_ with green _RARE_
sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her _RARE_ , if only to shade Doaty's flowers
, _RARE_ angel watched her from a nearby _RARE_ , the only angel in the cemetery
, suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and _RARE_ clouds when she and _RARE_ , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and _RARE_ _RARE_
family had come from _RARE_ _RARE_ , in the _RARE_ of the main Japanese island of _RARE_ , where there are still _RARE_ of the mysterious _RARE_ strain
were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal _RARE_ of the Japanese came from Southern Asia
were of _RARE_ blood
white _RARE_ and blue eyes ; ; all their men were _RARE_ , and many of their women were beautiful
few of them are left now , to _RARE_ mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient _RARE_ _RARE_ , which have the same haunting _RARE_ as the _RARE_ of the American _RARE_
them have been _RARE_ , but sometimes a man in _RARE_ or _RARE_ _RARE_ is much more _RARE_ than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be _RARE_ lovely , her _RARE_ warmed and improved by a little of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ from the South
was one of these fortunate occasions
taller than most Japanese girls , and had the _RARE_ _RARE_ form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall
was higher of bridge , her _RARE_ so pale as to be quite _RARE_ to _RARE_ , and the fish and _RARE_ diet of her _RARE_ had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong
, soft and full , was something for any man to dream about
black eyes , long and _RARE_ tilted , and the way she walked was melody
been in Japan just one week
an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ; she was already considering putting in _RARE_ _RARE_ for duty at San _RARE_ , _RARE_ , the Great _RARE_ , _RARE_ -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to _RARE_ her commission if the request were not granted

nothing wrong with her job
been assigned to the _RARE_ ward
no _RARE_ serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes _RARE_ up with the _RARE_ to serve as a marriage _RARE_ -- sometimes the Navy sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high
the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that Japanese _RARE_ firms were not permitted to operate on the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ too close _RARE_ , because the work involved setting off _RARE_ _RARE_ at all hours
interested in _RARE_ , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients
suffered in her _RARE_ hours
now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the _RARE_ Club , having coffee and a _RARE_ to sustain her until _RARE_
changed into a _RARE_ dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck
one of the _RARE_ crossroads -- you find them all around the world
the West Coast _RARE_ on _RARE_ _RARE_ of duty with the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ was the _RARE_ _RARE_ principal _RARE_ for maintenance , _RARE_ and shore liberty
later , all the gray Navy ships came in here ; ; if Tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San _RARE_ and Long Beach
wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there
, rather than saw , the approach of the _RARE_ young man
through from the _RARE_ Bar , which was stag , with the ice _RARE_ _RARE_ in a glass he carried
saw Tommy sitting alone , the _RARE_ sound stopped
perhaps a trifle _RARE_ , having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out of practice ; ; he wore a brown _RARE_ sports jacket obviously _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_ , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant
one of the _RARE_ -- an _RARE_
a _RARE_ chance , perhaps , that he would be _RARE_ , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different
something to a man -- and it wasn't just Japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas
as if foreign duty implied and _RARE_ license ; ; it _RARE_ that the folks at home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not
young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different
, _RARE_ ''
, turning on what was meant to be charm
_RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ date with me ''
beg your _RARE_ ''
out of her cold rage
don't believe I know you , and I can't understand your _RARE_ brand of English -- it was meant to be English , wasn't it ''
young officer fell back on his heels , _RARE_ and _RARE_
, he had the _RARE_ to _RARE_ , she thought
-- I'm sorry
, I thought -- I mean I really had no idea '' -- `` Oh , yes -- you had ideas ''
furiously
wrong ones ''
jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy _RARE_
off , _RARE_ ''
-- sorry ''
, and took off , obviously feeling like a fool
was that there was no _RARE_ satisfaction in this for Tommy
like a fool , too
been this way in college , or in _RARE_ training ; ; it wasn't this way in the hospital at San _RARE_
accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl
addressed her in broken English at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she wasn't American
Spanish girls who look like Tommy _RARE_ , _RARE_ with a _RARE_ hint of the _RARE_ in their faces ; ; there are _RARE_ from the _RARE_ states who are similarly _RARE_ , and -- back in the _RARE_ United States -- they were regarded simply as pretty women
having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , Tommy was being _RARE_ at every turn
around , _RARE_
Japanese _RARE_ were _RARE_ the English language at the counter -- _RARE_ _RARE_ happened to be one of them
Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ sandwich , or `` _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
cup of coffee
Japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well _RARE_
with a _RARE_ and _RARE_ lieutenant _RARE_ ; ; the other was with her American husband and their _RARE_ _RARE_ children
did nothing for _RARE_ mood
herself _RARE_ , and with pride , I am an American
she was , and would remain
was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the Club , there would always be _RARE_ young men who would approach her with broken English
been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good Japanese
know ; ; after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English
was becoming increasingly sure
been sent to the wrong place for duty
more to service in the Navy _RARE_ Corps than the hours in the ward
to have friends , and a _RARE_ life in _RARE_ hours
was _RARE_ male singing from the _RARE_ Bar
terribly off key , and poorly done , and Tommy could never admit to herself that male _RARE_ was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt _RARE_ and _RARE_
her _RARE_ and drank her coffee and paid her check ; ; she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated
angry had given her a slight _RARE_
her living quarters at the hospital she took _RARE_ of _RARE_ , and _RARE_
after a while , she went to her mirror
all true
looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men
still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach
a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone _RARE_
that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of _RARE_ -- which was not very far from _RARE_
she would take time to shop for the _RARE_ her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown
of course , had never heard of a _RARE_ , or Japanese _RARE_ , which says , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , and is literally translated as `` _RARE_ are better than _RARE_ ''
this is only another way of saying that blood is _RARE_ than water
scheduled appearance at _RARE_ mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline _RARE_ there is ordinarily for the young and _RARE_ , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report
beer hall _RARE_ in _RARE_ had been unusual , too , and _RARE_ _RARE_ was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert _RARE_ in _RARE_ _RARE_
anybody should wish to start a _RARE_ the executive officer didn't know
opinion , Doc had not grown up
was not entirely wrong in the belief
never been a good reason for Doc _RARE_ to grow up
come into the Navy too young , with the image of the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ before him
found him much too early , and its _RARE_ -- and especially its awful boredom -- were best forgotten in _RARE_ and elaborate practical _RARE_ , and even now Doc had never found any _RARE_ , _RARE_ influence
young at heart , with an _RARE_ sense of humor
about the _RARE_ _RARE_ of new men , took great delight in _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and gave no thought for tomorrow
doing thirty years , and the Navy would take care of him
security enjoyed by Doc _RARE_ , and nearly all members of the Armed Forces , is a wonderful thing
all a man in uniform has to do is to get by
not rise to the _RARE_ , but he can get by , and eventually be retired
been under _RARE_ to the ship since the _RARE_ left _RARE_
him of liberty in _RARE_ _RARE_ , but he told _RARE_ _RARE_ that _RARE_ _RARE_ was a book he had read before , and the Navy would always bring him there again , some day
he was restricted to the _RARE_ of the Base because _RARE_ _RARE_ , being thoughtful , knew that Doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the _RARE_ Base
Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well
two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many _RARE_ that had been dug into the hills on the Naval Base , and visit an old _RARE_
line had been _RARE_ up to _RARE_ the ship with the Base exchange
, Doc called _RARE_ _RARE_ , who was now a lieutenant and had a family
, Doc , you old _RARE_ ''
, with true affection

got to run an errand on the way
in about an hour ''
a smart _RARE_ at the _RARE_ , went up the _RARE_ , and turned down the wide street in front of the _RARE_ _RARE_ Club
he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time
some interesting _RARE_ but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk
was exercise , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , which was not only good for you but also made you more _RARE_ : the thought of _RARE_ activity left him exhausted
, with a _RARE_ companion -- but he'd lost his _RARE_ , hadn't played in years
swimming over at the Riverside Hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a _RARE_
packing trip into the _RARE_ , let his beard grow -- but that was too _RARE_
, he thought , take a long walk -- but where
rang
missed it '' , _RARE_ voice said , `` You should have gone over to the _RARE_ _RARE_ with us

but _RARE_ , and _RARE_ Williams and her _RARE_ band ''
, Buzz '' , Owen said
went over to the _RARE_ and dropped two notes ''
'' , Buzz said , `` Listen , we're having a stag dinner over at the _RARE_ _RARE_ on Friday
stag dinner with _RARE_ Williams ''
and laughed
to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to _RARE_ for stag dinners
'' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen ''
a _RARE_ _RARE_ who never let his _RARE_ rest
was finally rid of him , there was a _RARE_ _RARE_ at the door
'' , Owen called out
''
Mrs. _RARE_ Parker '' , a soft voice explained , `` And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes , please ''
he thought , a _RARE_ _RARE_ at last
me in the lobby
disappointed to find a nervous , _RARE_ woman with a big hat standing at the door
at his green _RARE_ with the yellow _RARE_
do you do ''
, _RARE_
church is _RARE_ a group of very _RARE_ women up in Alaska
them _RARE_ and they go among the _RARE_ making friends and bringing the light
there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them ''
''
see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the _RARE_ glasses _RARE_ _RARE_ in the bright light , `` you and I can't understand the many _RARE_ they have to _RARE_ ''
is that ''
wasn't satisfied with his reaction
Owen thought , _RARE_ and _RARE_
a slight nervous _RARE_ in the region of her left eye
her a _RARE_ , winking effect
you ever tried to reason with an _RARE_ ''
, winking wildly
are a very difficult group of people ''
don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably _RARE_ _RARE_ coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do ''
in a _RARE_ fashion
know , that's very interesting
know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that
_RARE_ I do , the more I note how far most people are from their personal God ''
Owen kept his peace
happen next
was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch
passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice
did you get by the desk ''
curiously
sure the hotel doesn't know you're _RARE_ around the _RARE_ , _RARE_ on _RARE_ doors and talking down _RARE_ ''
, I just come once a week
I visit a different hotel
it's my duty
this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these _RARE_
know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities
in pairs as much as a _RARE_ miles a day ''
you have any idea how far I travel every day
the whole Pacific _RARE_ ''
aware he was getting _RARE_ but he couldn't help himself
Parker drew back
hardly a Christian approach '' , she _RARE_
in the _RARE_ world ''
didn't say it was Christian
think you'll find many active Christian salesmen
religion isn't big business ; ; those _RARE_ and prayer books make a lot of money for _RARE_ houses , but they don't get top personnel
salesmen are in _RARE_ and _RARE_ ''
, I take it , plays no part in this '' , she said _RARE_
doesn't have any _RARE_ or _RARE_ '' , he said _RARE_ before he caught himself
silly ; ; why go on
were passing ; ; he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation
whiskey '' , she said , smiling and _RARE_ at the _RARE_ glasses
forget whiskey ; ; it's such a big _RARE_ ''
know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` I think you're going to have to excuse me
an appointment ''
can imagine '' , she said
down at the bar
do you want to do about the _RARE_
be freezing up there now
help them ''
a card or something
it over ''
have no card '' , she said bitterly
haven't been listening to what I've been telling you
hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race
_RARE_ for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ; he heard her _RARE_ on another door
him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ; then he realized he was hungry
, shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast
way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail
a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic _RARE_ on new lines they always issued
had sent him a statement on his _RARE_ _RARE_ , and there was a letter from the _RARE_ of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's _RARE_
breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto Virginia Street , he felt _RARE_
off to the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , still _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ River made a wide _RARE_
suddenly _RARE_ , _RARE_
luck at all he could easily find a _RARE_
was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the _RARE_ _RARE_
were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded
test himself , he played _RARE_ for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars
was opening up ; ; when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its _RARE_ around in his stomach
_RARE_ was dimly lit with _RARE_ _RARE_
more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a _RARE_
had the hard look of _RARE_ who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up
around the wall _RARE_ early _RARE_ in covered wagons , who appeared much more _RARE_ than the _RARE_
had a bright shining _RARE_ as they leaned out from the wall and _RARE_ _RARE_ into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful
of course , except the _RARE_ party who were bent on _RARE_ to death
wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , Owen _RARE_
down next to a _RARE_ blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes
a dirty word and left
surprised to see Mrs. _RARE_ Parker playing the _RARE_ _RARE_ that were _RARE_ arranged by the entrance
down and played two _RARE_ at once , looking grim , as if _RARE_ by mechanical devices , and Owen felt sorry for the _RARE_ depending on her support
_RARE_ sat down next to him in the _RARE_ place
a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the _RARE_
you need is a steady _RARE_ '' , the _RARE_ announced after watching Owen play
can't build on your _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
are you playing ''

just _RARE_ '' , the _RARE_ explained
keep all these plays in this little black book , and I watch over a _RARE_ period to find out what numbers are _RARE_
not my game
trying to find a breaking table in _RARE_
I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The _RARE_ ''
to know you
have to spend any time on your ranch ''
, of course I do
the _RARE_ , pushing a horse called _RARE_
own horse , and what I collect from him I use on _RARE_
can rack and _RARE_ and he's the _RARE_ thing in _RARE_ County
if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going , I'll land him on TV -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some Western hero

up while Owen was listening to The _RARE_ and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars
conclusively that The _RARE_ was a _RARE_ , so he walked on down to _RARE_ , an even more _RARE_ gambling _RARE_ than the _RARE_ _RARE_
looked in the back , Mrs. _RARE_ Parker was _RARE_ _RARE_ cards
spirit had _RARE_ ; ; he studied the pistol exhibition that _RARE_ _RARE_ as an added attraction
a long _RARE_ with green eyes , but she was a _RARE_ with her money in front of her
no great _RARE_ against _RARE_ ; ; it just seemed such a dry run
no cash around ; ; everyone was _RARE_ silver dollars
_RARE_ _RARE_ the green stuff into the office and gave the customers _RARE_ or checks or _RARE_ points
a special _RARE_ whereby _RARE_ would feature a special _RARE_ at three A.M. _RARE_ _RARE_ ( The _RARE_ ) Brenner and fourteen _RARE_ _RARE_
if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him
two _RARE_ , both wearing _RARE_ , and they made him feel a little sad
Buzz watching _RARE_
on a _RARE_ shirt and was carrying some _RARE_ oil and dark glasses
_RARE_ and _RARE_ than Owen , who felt good standing next to him
all going over to Lake _RARE_ and try our luck at _RARE_ '' , Buzz explained , still _RARE_
ran into a guy at the _RARE_ _RARE_ who _RARE_ we can beat the wheel
out as a _RARE_ , then became a pit boss until the Club found him _RARE_

about the pollen ''

see you around later ''
over to the _RARE_ table and the dice were hot , but he couldn't _RARE_ with any _RARE_ success
your luck , honey ''
_RARE_ blonde in a bursting _RARE_ addressed him
_RARE_ and _RARE_ , but he didn't get the impression he was being _RARE_ the way he'd been hoping

you go broke '' , she said , smiling up at him , `` I'll leave you ''
like real love '' , Owen said
sort of brings a lump to my throat ''
_RARE_ _RARE_ '' , the blonde said after she ordered a _RARE_
after the ballet
wanted to call me _RARE_ , but it sounded too affected ''
nothing

, `` _RARE_ me properly , Spencer ''
quiet for a moment longer , then he said , `` There is nothing I want to say , Captain ''
well ''
away
, he thought , had its moments of grim humor
had _RARE_ planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to _RARE_ him for a _RARE_ of proper address
morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no _RARE_ effect upon the men of the Somers
in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to _RARE_ _RARE_ under _RARE_ of some call of duty , so as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him
were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort

_RARE_ , I fear ''
opinion , who is this E. _RARE_ on the ' certain ' list ''
, of course
the _RARE_ and most experienced of the lot
the _RARE_ , not the _RARE_ of being identified as a _RARE_
talked Spencer into letting him use another name ''
a tap at the door and _RARE_ entered with the word that Heiser wished to see the Captain
him come in ''
_RARE_ and _RARE_ , brought the _RARE_ news that the _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ had been _RARE_ removed from their customary places
also , sir , two articles which were considered _RARE_ now must be regarded in another light entirely
knife and _RARE_ are at this moment being _RARE_ by McKinley and Green
_RARE_ to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer's possession and that '' -- `` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser
to you the disappearance of _RARE_ and _RARE_ and who '' -- He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him
revealed that the main _RARE_ mast had been carried away
milling about of what had been a _RARE_ , _RARE_ crew struck Alexander with horror
orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads _RARE_ toward the _RARE_ figure as though for further instruction
_RARE_ to _RARE_ side
violently jerked the _RARE_ brace with full intention to carry away the mast
him myself and it was done after _RARE_ with Cromwell
it , sir ''
was clear that _RARE_ was not mistaken , for both _RARE_ and Cromwell took no step toward _RARE_ in the sending up of the new _RARE_ mast till _RARE_ Spencer had given the signal to _RARE_
with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work
that they had planned confusion and _RARE_ , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and _RARE_
was sound enough and , he _RARE_ , had been _RARE_ only by _RARE_ Spencer's _RARE_ to _RARE_ an idea he had not originated
mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for _RARE_ and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in _RARE_ sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers
followers were openly sullen and _RARE_ , missing _RARE_ without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their _RARE_ at the prisoners being kept in _RARE_ , _RARE_ with the three by glance and signal
the missing _RARE_ came out of its hiding place after _RARE_ _RARE_ had been _RARE_ _RARE_ by _RARE_ Wilson
reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , _RARE_ the weapon
_RARE_ and _RARE_ , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , _RARE_ and McKinley
man on the _RARE_ , loyal or _RARE_ , could be _RARE_ by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of _RARE_
tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and _RARE_ to speak and to listen
had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had brought new _RARE_ , new fears
, `` It requires an _RARE_ eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely
the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed
aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer's _RARE_ of twenty _RARE_ followers was a modest estimate ''
'' , Heiser _RARE_ , `` why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' -- `` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in
is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners
suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what
have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order
, does this sound like a truly _RARE_ plan to you
not think these men might choose the black flag here and now ''
, `` Of course they would
about to do so at any moment as it is
is needed is for one man to feel _RARE_ enough to take the lead
as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed
going to be rushed and murdered ''
is _RARE_ language , Mr. _RARE_
not going to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said
are going to bring the Somers into New York _RARE_ safe and sound ''
course , I agree with the Captain '' , Gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the _RARE_ is _RARE_ and desperate
of discipline has been lost
possible when _RARE_ has the upper hand ''
, then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon
wood and iron are available for close and _RARE_ combat no matter where a man stands
are positive of so few and suspicious of so many ''
ourselves must stand _RARE_ ''

arms day and night , watch and watch about
us present , the _RARE_ brothers , _RARE_ and the other _RARE_ now have the responsibility of the Somers
deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed ''
he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done
his heart he had loved the Navy and now he must act in accordance with the _RARE_ _RARE_ laws
he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had _RARE_ his soul
he failed
he failed
had tried so hard , who had _RARE_ so _RARE_ to be a great officer
to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to _RARE_ for _RARE_ as to seek to storm the _RARE_ of heaven
given or it was not given
one's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward
one's best and if fortune _RARE_ , an _RARE_ boy with murder in his heart _RARE_ aboard one's ship
_RARE_ like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame
his tears were his to _RARE_ if he so desired , for it had not been with an _RARE_ rage for _RARE_ that he had held precious his naval career
had given him _RARE_ enough to satisfy any _RARE_
for love that he had served the Navy
_RARE_ that love returned was what he had lived for
hope was gone
he would bring the Somers safely into New York _RARE_ but at a price
, at what a price
a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity
he _RARE_ the prisoners , _RARE_ himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason
_RARE_ their eyes but not before he had _RARE_ hatred and anger
, the giant _RARE_ , was _RARE_ and _RARE_
, `` Captain , may I speak , please
I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship ''
you , Cromwell ''
, sir
I swear I am innocent
nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing ''
are the only man aboard who can be in doubt ''
cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent ''
closer to Alexander , _RARE_ up at him from the deck
, Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything ''
, Cromwell , I did not find your name
careful about that ''
, seeming with effort to shake himself from _RARE_ , spoke
, `` Cromwell is telling you the truth
innocent ''
his gaze to Spencer
and _RARE_ of his tone suggested _RARE_ of how _RARE_ was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell
Spencer too well to think him naive or _RARE_
a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a _RARE_ with Spencer
another human who understood the _RARE_ of _RARE_ with the inevitable
good fortune and there was bad and _RARE_ Spencer , in _RARE_ and ankle _RARE_ , knew it to be a truth
nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for _RARE_
captain , towering above the _RARE_ as a symbol of _RARE_ and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon _RARE_ Spencer
_RARE_ had _RARE_ his own _RARE_
could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him
fortune had favored neither the _RARE_ nor the _RARE_ captain , they would be each _RARE_ _RARE_
, if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent
your constant companion ''
eyes met _RARE_
tell you he is innocent ''
do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word ''

nothing to gain by defending Cromwell ''
to lose , either , Spencer ''
true '' , Spencer agreed and _RARE_ himself from the conversation
went back to _RARE_ of the sea
am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again
God , Captain , I am innocent ''
it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not _RARE_ to speak an _RARE_ , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell
was as guilty as any
of his could be interpreted in his favor and four _RARE_ , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in _RARE_ hands while Spencer whispered explanations
thought '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry ''
fantastic to turn from the seven men in _RARE_ to the _RARE_ , where a class of _RARE_ _RARE_ him
a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of _RARE_ _RARE_ here which Alexander recognized
these _RARE_ were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer's followers
me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the _RARE_
_RARE_ lay in the _RARE_
smelled _RARE_ and _RARE_
man appeared out of a side _RARE_ and walked toward us with quick _RARE_
a long _RARE_ coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with _RARE_
hat with its wide _RARE_ , high crown , and _RARE_ _RARE_ rode high
head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead
a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled _RARE_
suddenly conscious of my bare arms
in the market place wore _RARE_ dresses and covered their legs with cloth _RARE_
and watched him stride down the center of the road
were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the _RARE_ market place with his back straight and , _RARE_ on his _RARE_ , he entered an old stone building
seen me watching the young man

your mother was here he must have been a young boy
ones you will see now ''
hard and looked down at my feet _RARE_ along beside Rachel
me into a twisting side _RARE_
, _RARE_ buildings looked _RARE_ up , and their few windows stood high above our heads
that schools and _RARE_ occupied most of the buildings
one where the front door stood _RARE_ and climbed a flight of _RARE_ steps to the main floor
man with a white beard and dressed in a long _RARE_ coat , _RARE_ trousers , and a black _RARE_ greeted us
to him
, _RARE_ and _RARE_ his hands over his _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ at me
he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were _RARE_ , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor
pointed out toward the walls
in front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom
inside
us
crowded together on long wooden _RARE_ , and in the center of the room sat the teacher
beard dripped down over the front of his coat
hand poised a stick above his desk
his _RARE_ , _RARE_ eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in _RARE_ , `` One , two , three ''
stick against the desk
boys _RARE_ out a _RARE_ translation or interpretation of the Five _RARE_ of _RARE_ , which they had previously _RARE_ in _RARE_
a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick
opened his small mouth wide and _RARE_ back and forth on the bench in the way his _RARE_ and _RARE_ had studied and prayed in the _RARE_ of Europe
were tiny
large bright eyes , the small _RARE_ _RARE_ of all babies everywhere , and hair _RARE_ short except for the long _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ their little white faces
over _RARE_ _RARE_ and looked up only to watch the teacher
did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that there was a _RARE_ for _RARE_
language from the ghetto stopped
plunged the children into a new portion , this time in _RARE_ , _RARE_ the stick _RARE_
who _RARE_ back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and _RARE_
curled _RARE_ hung down to his narrow shoulders
center of his brilliant _RARE_ sat a small black _RARE_
barely rose above the table
at him for a long time
not return my interest
traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys
them ignored the _RARE_ and had apparently _RARE_ the words long ago
the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ them on with the stick
defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake
not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair
_RARE_ back and forth on the bench
teeth were missing
and backed out of the room
, looked at me , and _RARE_ with her tongue
down the cool hall silently
us came the _RARE_ of the stick and the _RARE_ voices of the boys who would grow to _RARE_ their lives to rigid study and prayer
, `` How long do they keep that up ''
day '' , she said
for _RARE_ , when they are _RARE_ all day ''
my hands together
turned _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the classroom
man in the _RARE_ clothes waited at the foot of the steps
down into his beard and muttered something in _RARE_
, `` He asks for money ''
by him
into the pocket of my skirt , _RARE_ ten _RARE_ , and dropped the coin
picked it up again and handed it to the old man
me
look at him
at Rachel

to have _RARE_ to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home

it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place

her tongue behind her teeth
, nothing
she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the _RARE_
the children
a strange woman , your mother
loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved
too impossible for her to do when she wanted
here to work for _RARE_

_RARE_
she loved danger

most strange woman
follow her impulse
an impulse when she was here in _RARE_ _RARE_ -- I was with her -- that led her to stay in _RARE_
wanted to bring children to _RARE_ so that they could leave their _RARE_
did not need to be in _RARE_
could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms
out to make sure that no Jewish child _RARE_ in the world had to live in a place such as this ''
quietly , _RARE_ nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be _RARE_ , `` Then why did she leave _RARE_
to know that very much ''
her hands together and slowed her pace
of her _RARE_ reported sharply on the _RARE_
her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me
sighed and her face relaxed
came into her life
good friends here , people who liked her
her
had to go out and hurt herself
a man here in town
her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted
very hard
a refugee who was able to come here because of her
with his son
I thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so
was a _RARE_ man , a big , handsome man with a _RARE_ to his walk as I have never before seen
the black _RARE_ on his arm , so he had been _RARE_ in a concentration camp
walked like a young man
was terribly _RARE_ and talked to no one
would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe
family was dead , except for his son
would always _RARE_ him when he wandered off , and she would send him home to his son
the son and was always glad to be sent back to him
son did something '' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` I don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the _RARE_ -- and the son was _RARE_
hours after the son was _RARE_ , your mother was informed
from a little group of us
sitting together , talking
to the father and found he had _RARE_ himself ''

silent in the stone _RARE_
continued with energy , `` I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father
saw her except the man _RARE_ ''
'' , I said
know him ''
me a direct , _RARE_ look
, `` _RARE_ wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee
she would only hurt herself
to me once that I must talk to her
did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that _RARE_ wanted her to marry him
her if she would , and she said she would not
known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not _RARE_ to marry him
I did not see her until two weeks after the refugee _RARE_ himself
to me one day
pale and skinny ; ; she was terribly alone
said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to _RARE_ and accepted his proposal
at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself
he was happy she would let him _RARE_ out her life and take care of her
never let her harm herself again
whole week he never let her stay alone
him lead her around
her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was
her with him wherever he went
not let her talk to people ; ; he did not let her choose her own food
limp and _RARE_ from her loss ; ; she did not care
I'll take you with me ''
of them against the world
been how she imagined it
he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too
the dream was over
waking up had happened
did I imagine ''

I see him about to swing low in a _RARE_
_RARE_ up the south fork of the _RARE_ _RARE_ River _RARE_ the _RARE_ dumped in it
saw him on a _RARE_ with a gang of _RARE_ _RARE_ it ''
take you with me
taken her all right
after youth _RARE_
the church and into his big car , it _RARE_ over the road with him driving and the headlights _RARE_ the _RARE_ ahead and after he hit college , his _RARE_ , the _RARE_ little pine board tourist courts , _RARE_ really , with a _RARE_ naked light bulb in the ceiling ( _RARE_ and naked as a _RARE_ , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the _RARE_ _RARE_ in after the _RARE_ , watching in between your _RARE_ at _RARE_ ) , a room complete with _RARE_ _RARE_ the light and the few casual _RARE_ _RARE_ the walls , an _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ waving
bed that _RARE_ in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for _RARE_ talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the _RARE_ , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened
Shafer would be in _RARE_ today for the wedding _RARE_ and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along
and the _RARE_ up there _RARE_ the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ back in his office _RARE_ out teeth , like they all knew he would
the _RARE_ would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a _RARE_ or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen
could hope the _RARE_ wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to _RARE_ _RARE_ in his suit of red _RARE_ , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the _RARE_ feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I'm pregnant ''
wish that
could wish your _RARE_ would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve _RARE_ out of him like air out of a _RARE_ tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is _RARE_ and at night
sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new _RARE_ _RARE_ , waiting for you to _RARE_ by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned _RARE_ tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , _RARE_ to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help
sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has _RARE_ you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , _RARE_ her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too
not having his baby _RARE_ warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some _RARE_ cracks your _RARE_
of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he _RARE_ a bread truck or _RARE_ the mail or checks the _RARE_ _RARE_ down at the _RARE_ , or _RARE_ seventeen oil _RARE_ and six _RARE_ mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one
even be a _RARE_ _RARE_ guy with _RARE_ ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even _RARE_ couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked
can be on the way to _RARE_ , your Gratt Shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead
you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him
don't share him , not even with God
is love , you don't
take you with me
that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie
he is on the way to _RARE_ you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you
a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart
him every mile further away
where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't
know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the _RARE_ who begged you to marry him , the one with the _RARE_ hair and the car he couldn't afford and the _RARE_ shoes
: `` Did he feel that way about me ''
to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt Shafer ; ; that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy
on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt _RARE_ substitute , that other guy
wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success
if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you
about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you
the world '' , she thought
out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the _RARE_ fence _RARE_ the grounds
_RARE_ factories there
factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments
were impatient , but they were the only ones
, the ones in the stands , were _RARE_ , for hearing the _RARE_ was for them like listening to a _RARE_ was for sophisticated folks in New York City
like being in the _RARE_ hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano _RARE_ _RARE_
good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day
stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling
man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever
sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too
a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it
and then your chest _RARE_ and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ along your arm
the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought
talked you wouldn't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it hadn't , in six weeks , _RARE_ enough to wet a _RARE_ _RARE_
at the man _RARE_ beside her , a man with weather cracks _RARE_ into his lean cheeks , with _RARE_ pale eyes reflecting all the _RARE_ he had seen , reflecting the sky and the _RARE_ which must follow now in August -- yes , with eyes _RARE_ the _RARE_ and here it was only June , only _RARE_ time again and thoughts of Gratt Shafer would not leave her
should have stayed at the store '' , she thought
the _RARE_ with the other old _RARE_ , back there she was the _RARE_ clerk and she was _RARE_ , which made her young enough to _RARE_ the usual ideal working conditions , like the _RARE_ toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down
no lock because _RARE_ didn't allow a lock
on the toilet would encourage _RARE_ and _RARE_
hadn't had a sincere _RARE_ in years and there were things written on the walls of the little _RARE_ place because you couldn't keep the public out -- entirely
not count the times _RARE_ had _RARE_ on the door , just a couple of _RARE_ that shook the whole damned closet and might , _RARE_ , break away the pipe connections from the wall
little _RARE_ meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would _RARE_ open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , _RARE_ clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot
hours were _RARE_ in the morning until eleven at night on _RARE_ and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no _RARE_ or _RARE_
, we three handled quite a few small _RARE_ , from spot drawings for advertising agencies _RARE_ to magazine work and quick _RARE_ jobs
us had his own _RARE_ besides
wonderful complicated _RARE_ drawings like something out of a medieval _RARE_ : hundreds of delicate details _RARE_ into an _RARE_ sheet and looking as if they had been done under a _RARE_ glass
drew precise _RARE_ spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic _RARE_ , The New _RARE_ , for instance , or _RARE_
book _RARE_ and covers for _RARE_ _RARE_ : naked girls _RARE_ in corners of _RARE_ furnished rooms while at the doorway , _RARE_ the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt _RARE_ clutching a revolver
could be The _RARE_ _RARE_ , but it would still have the same jacket illustration
once I did a jacket for _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , clothes
_RARE_ out the materials from which _RARE_ were made -- _RARE_ wood covered with leather -- so I'd get the light _RARE_ accurate
the art editor , took one look at my finished _RARE_ and said , `` Nothing doing , _RARE_
first place , it's static ; ; in the second place , it doesn't look authentic ; ; and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to _RARE_ in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold ''
, `` Mr. _RARE_ , it is as authentic as careful research can make it ''
, `` That may be , but it isn't authentic the way _RARE_ think
from their _RARE_ into television and the movies that _RARE_ in the middle ages had beautiful flowing _RARE_ like Little Lord _RARE_ , and only the _RARE_ had _RARE_
couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't _RARE_ enough ''
end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a _RARE_ instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the _RARE_ of a _RARE_ movie
as happy as a _RARE_
_RARE_ '' , he said
Donald , he actually sold paintings
painted in our spare time , and we had all started as _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it
; ; he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce _RARE_ or her friends
style , a real inner vision of his very own
strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults
the _RARE_ of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of _RARE_ , but with a _RARE_ that made the forms _RARE_ from the page and _RARE_ you in the eye
to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so _RARE_
have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting
had , at times , an _RARE_ _RARE_ air like a _RARE_ ; ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald , you've got _RARE_ blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well
thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting
all _RARE_ , and Donald didn't need much to live on ; ; none of us did
the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap _RARE_ of one kind or another
life class was my idea -- or rather , _RARE_ idea , but I was _RARE_ for it , and the other two wouldn't have gone if I hadn't talked them into it
to paint again
done a serious picture in almost a year
just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself
the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting
saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an _RARE_ -- like Peter _RARE_ , for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint ''
a kind of goal I set myself ; ; I had admired him long before I talked to him
to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income
we first met , at one of Mrs. _RARE_ giant parties , he was wearing a brown _RARE_ jacket with silver _RARE_ and a soft pink _RARE_ shirt ; ; instead of a _RARE_ he wore a leather _RARE_ drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure _RARE_
his tone : _RARE_ of _RARE_ and color , and another kind of _RARE_ as well , for his clothing and _RARE_ would have paid the _RARE_ rent for a year
fifteen years older than I -- _RARE_ -- but full of spring and _RARE_
look like what I thought of as an old man , and his _RARE_ and _RARE_ speech made him seem even younger
one of the most prominent magazine _RARE_ in America ; ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month
included him in its `` _RARE_ American _RARE_ '' series and had _RARE_ him at his studio in the East Sixties ; ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have _RARE_ in it painting the _RARE_ of _RARE_
a long talk with him
into Mrs. _RARE_ library , which had low _RARE_ all along the walls , and above them a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long , and a _RARE_ _RARE_ with a yellow background , that looked like an _RARE_ from a _RARE_ _RARE_
had _RARE_ made for Mrs. _RARE_ by Picasso himself
expensive _RARE_ , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being _RARE_ yourself
course of our talk , _RARE_ mentioned that he spent part of each week studying
yourself ''

, I take classes with different people '' , he said
don't think I've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft
it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other _RARE_ , as _RARE_ went to Italy to meet _RARE_ and _RARE_ ''
a circle with his thumb and fingers
isn't this big , you know
embrace only the artist , alone before his _RARE_
as large as all of art , _RARE_ , varied , _RARE_ ''
his arms wide , his face shining
artist is like a _RARE_ of a _RARE_ -- no , he is more than that , a _RARE_ _RARE_ in some vast _RARE_
these days , I'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days , from extreme abstract _RARE_ to extreme _RARE_ , and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other
is all , _RARE_ or _RARE_
what a title for the exhibition : The _RARE_ is All ''
do you study ''

_RARE_ ; ; just listening to him made me feel intelligent
studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied
you know him
at the Manhattan School of Art ''

studied with Burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me , along with the _RARE_ _RARE_ for my paintings of _RARE_ on Hudson Street
I had not loved each other
also studying _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , he went on , `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ ''

God , is he still alive
be a million years old
to a _RARE_ of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of _RARE_ ''
quite ''

about sixty , now
, still a kind of modern _RARE_ , beautiful _RARE_ of mountains and farms
makes the city look like one of _RARE_ _RARE_
admired him , and when I heard he was taking a few pupils , I went to him and joined his class ''
, it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you don't think of yourself as an _RARE_ painter ''
missing the point '' , he said
has the _RARE_ eye
is a great man
him is _RARE_
the trouble with so many artists today
stimulation
alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only _RARE_ in _RARE_ themselves still farther from life
of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation
_RARE_ Ages , in the Renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world
an _RARE_ , a man who studied his trade and developed his _RARE_ the way a _RARE_ or a wood _RARE_ did
a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , _RARE_ its wars and its leaders , its _RARE_ and its _RARE_ , reflecting its profound religious _RARE_
a _RARE_ -- they weren't afraid of the word , then -- _RARE_ , nature _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , what you will , a member of every party and of no party
at us today
safe little jobs _RARE_ _RARE_ ads or the _RARE_ _RARE_ in trivial novels , and most of our _RARE_ painting is nothing but picking the _RARE_ out of the _RARE_ so it can be _RARE_ in greater _RARE_
of _RARE_ _RARE_
need is to get back to the group , to learning and _RARE_ , to the _RARE_ and the school ''
certainly talk
of the evening was that I got the address of _RARE_ studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning
an awkward hour , but I didn't have to _RARE_ any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job
short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the _RARE_ reading out to work
mostly for the benefit of the _RARE_ , because hardly anybody else ever visited us
way , _RARE_ was right
'' was the word for it
know that it was always as _RARE_ as I had expected it to be
it was because _RARE_ himself wasn't what I anticipated
come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead _RARE_
that isn't quite fair
there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of _RARE_ after a week
little thing to start with -- the car registration
, where is the car license ''

can't find it in the _RARE_ compartment ''
must have it '' , I answered readily enough , _RARE_ her last visit
'' , she was frowning
should Via have it ''
forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children
silent
want to _RARE_ things up
drive my own car by _RARE_ of Via ''
sure she'd turn it over to you , if you'd rather
that ''
as if she were _RARE_ me of some _RARE_
must have taken the registration when she went to _RARE_
her ''
, thank you
nothing of _RARE_ ''
this suddenly _RARE_ her
giving me checks for my pay , the household bills
been in such a _RARE_ that this had slipped her mind
a fool I've been '' , she said quietly
knew all this , but I paid no attention
even own the house I'm standing in
so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would _RARE_ up all those things `` It _RARE_ down down down and finally there is no way out
am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing ''
I should have paid attention to that _RARE_ remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress _RARE_ in
you , I hate you , I feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living
went about my business
a lemon _RARE_ , a light _RARE_ , _RARE_ a chicken , _RARE_ some frozen _RARE_ , so there would be something nice in the _RARE_ for the weekend
bother , _RARE_ '' , she said
have these _RARE_ in town for Saturday , and I'll probably spend Sunday with _RARE_ or the _RARE_ ''
, I thought , she's _RARE_ her spirits
_RARE_ in London , and new faces about her there , she would soon be a more _RARE_ , a _RARE_ person , all the better for her stay out here
more _RARE_ , as if I had had a part in bringing her through to a greater _RARE_ of herself
went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life
_RARE_ that evening , but the path to my house was so well _RARE_ that I could feel my way , accustomed as I was to the dense _RARE_ that rise from the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the river and sometimes last for days
morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village I crept along with my headlights full on
notice a _RARE_ of light from the big house through the woods but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the fog I assumed Mrs. Salter had done the same before she left for town
my shopping , had my _RARE_ appointment , and from there I went to the women's lunch at our _RARE_ church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas _RARE_ , so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon
next day -- Sunday
when I drove down to church , didn't it speak to me , seeing the lights still on and the day _RARE_ and clear
to the _RARE_ accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , _RARE_
came back from church at noon Mrs. _RARE_ was turning into the Salter driveway
a _RARE_ length I could sense that something was wrong , and so I followed her up to the _RARE_ in front of the house
was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us
nowhere , nowhere ''
, and both women ran up to the house , and I followed
began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening _RARE_ , talking , _RARE_ in _RARE_ and _RARE_
as I had left it the night before last -- her _RARE_ and bag for town , her _RARE_ and dress and shoes laid out only her _RARE_ coat was missing

_RARE_ began
who until that day before had been Mrs. _RARE_ friend , her equal , was the _RARE_ now
_RARE_ and Mrs. _RARE_ who were calling Via , everybody
they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me
I brought them _RARE_ and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait
the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs. Salter said that could have been a sign to me
I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing ''
that alarm me then
she returned from taking her guests back to New York she had said , `` All they talked about was _RARE_ _RARE_ this , _RARE_ that When they know the truth will they drop away from me , will I become a nothing ''
I remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her _RARE_ , over and over again , `` On the boat people liked me for myself ''
made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check
night I had called , but the line was always busy and it _RARE_ me
it was one of those _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ or _RARE_ , she comfortable in bed
seemed not from what they were saying
it a final desperate _RARE_ from her , to whom
and on past any man's patience some final _RARE_ of conclusion
found the day after at the bottom of the cliff
to believe that what must have happened was that , _RARE_ , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing
took the path that _RARE_ up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff
romantic up there , she used to say , with the broad river _RARE_ in its _RARE_ like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic
that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a _RARE_ rock , a _RARE_
didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else
_RARE_ brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , I began to _RARE_ with a terrible excitement , almost _RARE_ , that I still cannot account for
a _RARE_ release from the long strain of _RARE_ of those weeks
last the _RARE_ , the will gives way
was it that , before Via , _RARE_ , Walter and all , I began almost to dance with _RARE_ and cry out , `` I knew she'd do it
''
at me and drew back
turned cold and _RARE_ , even _RARE_
have never changed
same time that I thought I understood her at long last and _RARE_ her , _RARE_ this knowing had there burned _RARE_ by my pity a fire of hate , an _RARE_ _RARE_ that burst out in that _RARE_ _RARE_
what had given way in me
I am _RARE_ at how little anyone knows of what they really are
absurd of course to say that that one _RARE_ _RARE_ me from the family I considered my very own , but there it _RARE_ , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other
time I was filled with _RARE_ at this separation , but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that _RARE_
person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it , I can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a _RARE_ for what is not to be _RARE_
not their _RARE_ that _RARE_ ; ; it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so _RARE_ and walk away , that it _RARE_
tell them , but no one ever asked , why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body
I forget Mrs. _RARE_ , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened
me ; ; she _RARE_ in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country
all feel guilty '' , I turned away from her coldly
was _RARE_ fault
her hand ''
do you mean ''

put such a high value on being top dog ''

_RARE_ , almost _RARE_ , this _RARE_ _RARE_ , and she has never come to see me since
she had not taken Mrs. _RARE_ advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , _RARE_ of love , hanging on to _RARE_ , and altogether and finally _RARE_
chose , and in that final decision _RARE_ , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have _RARE_ to her _RARE_ height , and _RARE_ her _RARE_ self , felt at last the passion of a great moral decision
say I could have stopped her it is because they are _RARE_ of her last weeks of _RARE_ , her search into herself and its conclusions
I had cried out that I knew she'd do it , but without my fully _RARE_ it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , _RARE_ at her _RARE_ from _RARE_ and _RARE_ -- and guilt
finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice
with my darling _RARE_ , the first Mrs. Salter
came home
service was in the house , the _RARE_ minister , how clean and _RARE_ his _RARE_ and his neat body standing beside that _RARE_ with that _RARE_ inside , a stranger speaking to _RARE_ the old sacred words , and the rain _RARE_ _RARE_ in _RARE_ , seven days of _RARE_ rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed

called to say they had decided to _RARE_ her -- as they had _RARE_ , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning
stood on _RARE_ in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor , on its dark shining surface the _RARE_ of white _RARE_ I had ordered
, just for _RARE_ I thought at the time , but found myself _RARE_ , `` Our Father which Art in Heaven '' And it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief
in the parking lot when I went outside
waited in her car until the _RARE_ moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey
time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the _RARE_ _RARE_ with its _RARE_ symbols of religious _RARE_
felt _RARE_ to _RARE_ , and reached back and pulled Via down
come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of _RARE_ would give her some _RARE_
had a rather small place of my own
_RARE_ apartment in a place called the _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
'' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left _RARE_
then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio ''
''
not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him
, I'd drink with newspaper people
I was what you might call a _RARE_ man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive
think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with ''
he waited for her to turn , to ask a question
no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little
, what about you , Carla ''
''
, turning slowly
about me ''
you make friends easily ''
, _RARE_ ''
I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot
it ''
guess so '' , she said taking a _RARE_ from her purse
had wiped some of the _RARE_ from her mouth , she stared _RARE_ at her image in the mirror
your people still alive ''
, trying to touch a part of her life _RARE_ hadn't discussed ; ; so he could have something of her for himself
talk so well , Carla '' , he went on
seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to _RARE_ her _RARE_
must have been good at history at school
you go to school ''
is this ''
, turning suddenly
you know all about me by this time
Carla _RARE_
my town
with you
something more about me every day , don't you
be _RARE_ if I made up some stories about my life , told you some lies
you trying to worry me ''
not trying to worry you ''
, all right then ''
tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing
he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance
just naturally _RARE_ about everything but her physical appearance

have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and _RARE_ the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her _RARE_ , make the bed while she lay around
up , ready to _RARE_ his _RARE_ , then grew afraid
_RARE_ on the _RARE_ he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too
the matter ''
suddenly

all '' , he said quietly
go out ''
those the only shoes you have , Sam ''
the matter with them ''
heavy thick _RARE_
them ''
an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot
them ''
, no one around here _RARE_ such heavy _RARE_
get another pair ''
I could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him
get an _RARE_ pair of _RARE_ Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla ''
I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face
the matter with it ''
put on the gray jacket and the _RARE_ slacks and the _RARE_ shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street
, Sam
like a _RARE_ _RARE_
wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged ''
don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention
clothes , he put on his _RARE_ _RARE_ suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good
was a hopeful sign , he told himself
longer wanted anything about him to _RARE_ her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in _RARE_
they _RARE_ around , just getting the feel of the city
at the _RARE_ of the old Roman wall on the lower Via _RARE_ , then they went to the _RARE_ _RARE_
some amusing _RARE_ about the _RARE_ in the old days
took a taxi to _RARE_
a church you should see '' , she said
they stood by the fountain in the _RARE_ looking at _RARE_ _RARE_ he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with _RARE_
her tell him all about the church
had dinner
she was _RARE_ and pleased with herself
got home at midnight she was tired out
the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing
never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her _RARE_ him for his remarks when he had looked up at the _RARE_ and the church at the top of the Spanish _RARE_
a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought
like to take him to St. _RARE_
, wake up '' , he said shaking her
ten o'clock
going out to mass
take me to St. _RARE_ ''
'' , she muttered
on , you'll be late ''
think I'll sleep in this morning '' , she said _RARE_ , and as she _RARE_ against him , he wondered if she ever went to church
he want her to go to church
Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security
be good for her
too bad he had no feeling himself for church
poor mother's fault
have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible
himself , he just didn't have the _RARE_ for it
time he had been at college he had achieved a certain _RARE_ and _RARE_ by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know
thought of those Old _RARE_ figures on the ceiling of the _RARE_ _RARE_
out of a _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ believe it would be good for Carla to have those old _RARE_ _RARE_ her imagination now
woman though , she would take only what she needed from church
too bad he wasn't a _RARE_ himself
_RARE_ , or one of those amusing _RARE_ _RARE_ , or a _RARE_ _RARE_ Communist
the matter with him that they all _RARE_ him
the times , he was sure
_RARE_ changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an _RARE_ of his freedom
all too _RARE_
else

same , he thought , _RARE_ over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and went to church
hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the _RARE_ , hearing them _RARE_ down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass
to him that if the _RARE_ felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla
we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us ''
waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam
little to do ''
not ''

not good at that kind of thing ''
afternoon let's take an air with them
fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were _RARE_
you find it necessary , Sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the _RARE_
am what I am
help it ''
remained with him , _RARE_ him for hours
know how she would behave with other people
walked into the _RARE_ apartment , the old lady , _RARE_ and smiling , said softly
, '' and put out her hand
brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes _RARE_ , and with her little _RARE_ she said all the _RARE_ things
smiling too , said , `` _RARE_ '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy ''
sat down and began their little coffee party
offered them _RARE_ with the coffee
as _RARE_ Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly _RARE_
turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again
, he felt like a _RARE_ at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth
, _RARE_ her head _RARE_ , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest

woman had a nephew from North Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and who had _RARE_ to Canada to work on the _RARE_
year the boy had lived in the _RARE_ in a boxcar
of _RARE_ _RARE_ live in _RARE_ in the _RARE_
ever lived in a boxcar
to know
explained that he had no experience with _RARE_
same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country
_RARE_ her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope
great Pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes _RARE_

_RARE_ too
said that he had had a vision
thousands that day in _RARE_ had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to _RARE_ for _RARE_
been sitting quietly , listening with the _RARE_ of the unaware
little flush came on her pale homely face and _RARE_ in her eyes
Father would die soon , she said to Carla , so she could translate for Sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those _RARE_ offered by the great _RARE_ of the world
the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint
he was indeed a saint now
and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered _RARE_
a certain _RARE_ among the _RARE_
, in the _RARE_ of his great _RARE_ , had neglected them a little
be changes made , and _RARE_ _RARE_ should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a _RARE_ in Rome
be lost and new faces would become prominent
_RARE_ understand
did , Sam said _RARE_ , trying to get _RARE_ eye
could see that these women were her _RARE_ , too , he thought
_RARE_ and plain like a family she might meet in _RARE_ or _RARE_ or _RARE_
eyes were on _RARE_ whose _RARE_ face and _RARE_ eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness
, watching in wonder , turned to Sam
means so much to her
a flame , I guess '' , she said in a _RARE_ tone
night _RARE_ moved in the direction of the women's lodge , where _RARE_ of Night had gone to _RARE_ herself
blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill _RARE_ the _RARE_ with his lips , making it whisper
her emerge suddenly , coming in her _RARE_ fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with _RARE_ the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme _RARE_ and indifference she would pass by all the _RARE_ looks of those whom she might approach
dark , _RARE_ fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding
come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart _RARE_ in him , and turned away , afraid now
, wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil _RARE_ in her _RARE_ more
caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off
he saw as often before some _RARE_ , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and _RARE_ like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the _RARE_ when they are perhaps pressed by the _RARE_
out to her , his back turned
fled , not waiting to see if she _RARE_ him or took notice of his cry
heard him go
did not _RARE_ and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp
heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their _RARE_ then gathering in small , curious _RARE_
came from her bed , from beside her _RARE_ husband , _RARE_ , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild _RARE_ , the sound of _RARE_ voices
she saw _RARE_ of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost _RARE_ , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of _RARE_ waited , perhaps _RARE_ the _RARE_ that moved in her
last she could suffer the _RARE_ no longer , nor face the girl's _RARE_ , she said in a voice _RARE_ : `` I shall call your father
where you can bring no harm , or I will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame ''
girl said only , `` Tell him I am here , that I have come ''
was not _RARE_ of _RARE_ she meant
with real anger at last , something proud and _RARE_ , Early Spring stood like a she _RARE_ before her _RARE_ and cried , `` I will not _RARE_ at you
tell you to go , not begging
''
the knife she used for _RARE_ _RARE_ she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side
bring only _RARE_ '' , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the _RARE_ hunger of a wild animal
a low voice of _RARE_ she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , _RARE_ bearing and did not even look at the knife
take _RARE_ , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said
do not have to face battle
not let your evil in
simply kill you first
''
women had come close now , their voices _RARE_ together until they stood _RARE_ in an angry knot , their threats _RARE_ , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt
up sticks and _RARE_ them at the girl
fell like a shower around her and she felt them _RARE_ her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her _RARE_
all shouting at her as if she were the _RARE_ of the evil she brought
did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old _RARE_ of her extreme youth until suddenly _RARE_ of _RARE_ came _RARE_ among them , swinging a great _RARE_ whip
back to your _RARE_ ''

pack of dogs makes less noise ''
the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some _RARE_ over themselves in their flight
Spring seized the whip and said : `` If you must _RARE_ someone , let it be her , your daughter
_RARE_ out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband ''
old man turned on her , _RARE_ the whip from her hand
into your _RARE_ ''

back to that _RARE_ man of yours who so _RARE_ his fine body among the young women
back , if you must tell me what to do
be the one to _RARE_ my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to _RARE_ ''
before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , sitting up in a half _RARE_ to say : `` What _RARE_ thing happens
I dreamed of _RARE_ fighting ''
went to him and pressed herself against his _RARE_ , _RARE_ the _RARE_ odor of the whisky he had stolen from _RARE_
, `` There is nothing that concerns you here
and go to sleep
not dream
let the _RARE_ spirits enter your brain ''
back , _RARE_ , and was soon asleep again
the old man , beyond all the _RARE_ of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the _RARE_ _RARE_ of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her _RARE_ ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms
_RARE_ her against a _RARE_ , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it _RARE_ and crack in the damp air , _RARE_ its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it _RARE_ and cracked , settling its own cruel _RARE_ on her shoulders while she stood as _RARE_ , as dark and _RARE_ as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale _RARE_ of the _RARE_ so close to her face
to him , her father , `` How was I _RARE_ , in pain or joy
for me to be _RARE_ the flesh you made grow on me
know your foolish name ''
at the pale _RARE_ on the tree , hearing her breath _RARE_ from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the _RARE_
the _RARE_ _RARE_ and heard her father say in _RARE_ _RARE_ words which had no meaning , like , `` _RARE_

of an animal in rage and despair
_RARE_ stopped fighting the air and she heard _RARE_ of _RARE_ say in his high , _RARE_ voice : `` Did you follow me to see my shame
the line or I will settle the whip on you

hear the anger of the _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
the girl saw _RARE_ standing between , his narrow shoulders _RARE_ , his arms hanging long and _RARE_
, `` Let me take her _RARE_ , for there are _RARE_ in me too ''
without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , _RARE_ her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and _RARE_ , listening to the _RARE_ of her heart and wanting for once to cry
while the young men waited outside the lodge of _RARE_ , _RARE_ in his _RARE_ language as he talked with himself
like a _RARE_ old _RARE_ , his hair stiff and _RARE_
and _RARE_ the _RARE_ of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , _RARE_ _RARE_ until finally , _RARE_ and sick , he fell into his own _RARE_
the young men who had been silent long enough
could taste the _RARE_ of violence and _RARE_ through his _RARE_
moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , _RARE_ the gloom they saw in the faces around them
out and held their games and races
they who held the future in their hands
into the sun together and _RARE_ _RARE_ in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred _RARE_ dug far off in the cave of _RARE_
the _RARE_ wildly at night , the war dance , and _RARE_ their _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and rode their horses in swift _RARE_ , firing their few guns in _RARE_ at some _RARE_ signal
among them , and _RARE_ , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing
very young one , _RARE_ _RARE_ , tried to _RARE_ them and followed _RARE_
was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the _RARE_ _RARE_ of youth worked
spring _RARE_ upright suddenly after sitting quietly with _RARE_ , because something had _RARE_ over in his _RARE_ _RARE_
young men , _RARE_ among them , _RARE_ them in matched racing
and _RARE_ for war , swinging their horses in single file and then _RARE_ like _RARE_
they would ride _RARE_ through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their _RARE_
they would stand in circles making other preparations
their hair and _RARE_ it at the part and _RARE_ the _RARE_ so that the hair above their _RARE_ stood rigid like the _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ making love
his _RARE_ with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees
himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a _RARE_ arrow from the taut bow , _RARE_ with a mad grace , his _RARE_ shining and _RARE_ with meadow _RARE_
always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , _RARE_ him
suspicious , _RARE_ eyes of _RARE_ of _RARE_
of Early Spring , haunted and now full of hurt and _RARE_
so much like laughing ; ; even like shouting and crying out from the _RARE_ from which he could _RARE_ as an _RARE_ in a mad _RARE_ from the _RARE_
_RARE_ planned a great parade with the young men
give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their _RARE_
ride with _RARE_ _RARE_ , their colors _RARE_ in the sun , shouting the last _RARE_ of a nation in the _RARE_ of death
the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and _RARE_ which ran with their hearts
their horses and rode off into the hills
young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening
rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , _RARE_ hoofs of the _RARE_ , horses the white men once had called the _RARE_ of Hell
them in _RARE_ images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge
with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , _RARE_ _RARE_ , their hair flying like dark _RARE_ , only the thunder , the roll of _RARE_ , the mad _RARE_ of the hoofs accompanying them
into the wind and seemed like one _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ until suddenly they rose straight in their _RARE_ and in one _RARE_ voice shouted , _RARE_ their _RARE_ cry of war
moving through a screen of _RARE_ , in among the white _RARE_ and _RARE_
from the quarry began to _RARE_ in her ears
, once more listening
never been here at this hour
as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would _RARE_ at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the _RARE_ of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark _RARE_ of water beneath her
ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days
, and _RARE_ let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her _RARE_ sliding in the leaves
out onto the flat _RARE_ of rock and , _RARE_ herself , shook her _RARE_ brown hair and tilted her chin far upward
music of the _RARE_ had faded , but presently it began again , growing in volume until it was _RARE_
at peace and drew her legs up and _RARE_ her hands tightly around the bent knees
accomplished a _RARE_
her place
couldn't change it
only -- her thoughts were a little strange
becoming confused
was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now
thinking of _RARE_ a few weeks ago , in the _RARE_ _RARE_ , with her at one of those awful Friday _RARE_ _RARE_ Class parties her mother had made her attend
, Julie , how are you ''
off he went so casually , to someone else with _RARE_ better developed , more obvious in a _RARE_ dress , someone without a _RARE_ of wire bands and an _RARE_ to find words that would hold him
he was with me now , she thought , and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_

I were older or younger , Julia _RARE_ thought
so much someone loved me
remembered seeing the door open _RARE_ during the night -- _RARE_ , in a white _RARE_ , standing like a ghost at the threshold
vanished ; ; he must have slept again
staring at the blue _RARE_ lamp left on beside him
too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ; but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning
was like a prison
not be _RARE_ to Sam
, as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the humming of a vacuum _RARE_
_RARE_ across the _RARE_
left both of his eyes _RARE_
he told himself , let's put the show on the road
walking across to the bathroom
a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands
pain had come from his head , as if the water were _RARE_ up through the blood vessels and expanding them
his jacket and trousers
was dark ; ; the _RARE_ weren't too apparent ; ; and there were his shoes , thank God , but his shirt was one terrible mess
, and then tore away the _RARE_ parts and wound the rest around his neck like a _RARE_
be amazed to find him gone
have to understand
have put his clothes in the closet
a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of _RARE_
on the _RARE_ of tears
-- in a fashion he _RARE_ a _RARE_ to that _RARE_ gentleman
Alex had told him he wasn't dying
_RARE_ would be better off dead
was it
at his _RARE_
it was still running
to seven
for a vacuum _RARE_ , but probably Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs
_RARE_ to tie his _RARE_
felt _RARE_ thick and _RARE_
slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door
knew himself
some _RARE_ , two _RARE_ of _RARE_ tape across his nose , like ugly _RARE_ from the mass of _RARE_ , suddenly moist over his _RARE_
, however , was perfectly white
drinking another glass of water
after seven o'clock
supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall
take over
to think , but the main thing , the _RARE_ necessity , was to leave before Sam _RARE_ was up and about , and before _RARE_ _RARE_ him with sympathy
the hallway
actually walking down the stairs
up in the sky , above the clouds , and this _RARE_ _RARE_ of a man desperately trying to get away
, is that you ''
issued from the _RARE_ of the hall below
not reply
that you , Father
''
moment he felt like a _RARE_ discovered
appeared under the _RARE_ leading to the dining room
_RARE_ at him
George ''
trying to smile at her

be up , should you ''
-- I was just leaving here , Julie
set
to call a taxi ''
wearing some sort of gray _RARE_
_RARE_ tall , her _RARE_ knitted in concern
, at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying
about to leave myself
you off ''
leaving ''
going back to school '' , she answered
driving me
_RARE_ breakfast
you told Mother you were going ''

don't want anyone disturbed , Julie
wish
a big one '' , he added
seemed to _RARE_ in an _RARE_ bright shaft of sunlight
, won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something
a drink ''
, in a way that seemed _RARE_ sophisticated , _RARE_ , and yet perhaps partly _RARE_
to see her face more clearly
-- nothing at all '' , he said after a _RARE_ _RARE_
just wait for you here ''
his head against the wood _RARE_ behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his _RARE_

past
have to say _RARE_ upstairs
be long ''
a great favor , Julie '' , he said , `` please don't mention you've seen me ''
to anyone ''
-- please
call your mother as soon as I get home
so much easier ''
right '' She was staring at him
fine , Julie
you just go ahead ''
disappeared
feel a _RARE_ _RARE_ against the _RARE_
_RARE_ voice : `` George , what the hell goes on ''
have the strength to answer , he thought
couldn't have called a taxi
hear the footsteps overhead
the suitcase , which Julia was holding
up
take that , Julie -- for you ''
no '' , she said
can manage ''
ahead of him
Lincoln was parked
hardly believe he was getting in
_RARE_ at him in an _RARE_ , _RARE_ fashion ; ; but that didn't matter
Mr. _RARE_ off in _RARE_ '' , Julia said , and for the _RARE_ second George was reminded of her father's tone with servants
manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ; yet her _RARE_ seemed forced or _RARE_
not stop to _RARE_
never felt particularly close to her
more _RARE_ , but obviously Julia had respected his request
her hand
wish I didn't have to go back to school '' , she said , and then , `` I wish you lived in New York
the opposite direction ''
wish I did '' , he responded
wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous _RARE_ , and that we could go to a _RARE_ together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew '' He stopped speaking
we ever knew what ''
, just sort of everything in general ''
nothing until _RARE_ had _RARE_ their pace
know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a _RARE_ thing for you to say ''
it ''

, perhaps
to joke about things , aren't I
life can be rather a _RARE_ business ''
seemed thick and _RARE_

reached into his pocket
there was the key

him
moment he smiled
, Julie dear
me the greatest possible service
I'll be fine ''
care of yourself then ''
will
also
too hard ''
an automatic phrase ; ; as he crossed through the _RARE_ he _RARE_ it
have discovered a more tender farewell
at him , `` Well
look at George _RARE_
to you ''
_RARE_ into a door handle '' , George said

steadily ahead into his entry
seemed on fire
shut his door with the brass number _RARE_ to it
_RARE_ the raw whiskey made him _RARE_
or two _RARE_ , he told himself , enough to _RARE_ some of the pain
_RARE_
, _RARE_ , I'm home
really , right as rain
not to worry about the car
it _RARE_ away
please -- no visit today -- I'll be asleep
sake , don't worry
me more than anything
sure , I'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist
was one more call to make
, did I wake you ''

, I thought you'd probably be up
_RARE_ , some fool was
be driving somewhat _RARE_ last night
turned out to be me , but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss
no , I'm not in a hospital
be in town for a couple of days , though , and there's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon
a jury isn't involved
struggle in for a jury
hands down
thought maybe Tony _RARE_ could _RARE_ for me
-- you might give him sort of a _RARE_ _RARE_
all the facts
want to ask for a _RARE_ -- it's really just a routine thing

darling I'd rather you didn't come out ''
pulled at the lower strip of _RARE_ tape
even send flowers
you Wednesday
you with a nice '' -- He was about to say `` double _RARE_ '' but thought better of it
take you out to dinner

had put down the receiver
relationship between _RARE_ _RARE_ and himself
about it
alone in the older part of the city , in one of those _RARE_ houses whose brick _RARE_ some early _RARE_ had constructed
two tiny rooms on the second floor
a _RARE_ girl , a most efficient secretary
him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her
office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ; yet if he said : Make an excuse yourself , come out here today , she would have been on the next train -- and , similarly , if she had been in need , he would have gone to her
make us _RARE_ look good ''
a peculiar way to think ''
just the _RARE_ birds that had _RARE_ her own feathers , of course ; ; she knew that
_RARE_ `` little '' sister Myra , the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , forever _RARE_ , Myra
year older than I am , Lucy told herself
, come '' , Jim said , _RARE_ Lucy a little
love you
''

Susan was not
busy feet , _RARE_ like _RARE_ , _RARE_ around her room
be visiting her _RARE_ for only a few days , but even at seven she was a _RARE_ soul ; ; she always packed for a _RARE_ , just in case
yet
in the house must be going with her ''
better step on it
long way to _RARE_ ''
young face was an _RARE_ one , too ; ; as he looked at her , it registered anxiety
know '' , he said
wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy
only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful ''
not believe him ; ; Myra appreciated nothing
put the thanks in his _RARE_ mouth
'' -- she said , and the single word _RARE_ love and _RARE_ in an equal _RARE_
should have told me herself
it be only a couple of weeks
happened the last time ''
with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a _RARE_ brief visit ; ; but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them
that Myra would never have come home if _RARE_ , _RARE_ husband , hadn't gone out to _RARE_ her
was an awfully long two weeks ''
otherwise silent moment , _RARE_ keys _RARE_ _RARE_ in his pocket
she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last
got to admit she was smart to _RARE_ up this fine government job over there -- _RARE_ get a home for herself and Cathy in no time
, _RARE_ settling down ''
_RARE_ , he added , `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow ''
depends on the widow ''
an idea that Myra loved it
for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down
to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant _RARE_ that were her way of life
succession of _RARE_ , she now considered Cathy , an ominous _RARE_ on her horizon
not that she disliked Cathy
drew her , troubled her depths ; ; whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or _RARE_ , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra
was _RARE_ responsibility , not hers
wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said _RARE_ , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever ''
big cities ; ; thousands of miles away -- in Paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother
her too well to find it impossible
a _RARE_ thing to accuse her of ''
so _RARE_ it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming _RARE_ of a _RARE_
to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , _RARE_ , `` Susan

''
_RARE_ sound returned
yell at Susan '' , Lucy said
only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the _RARE_ river
around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ; their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as _RARE_ in light , as the air around them
from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had _RARE_ ; ; Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line
back from the _RARE_ and looked at her
_RARE_ , which had been lowered in anger , _RARE_
'' , he said
isn't a chance of _RARE_ letting anything like that happen
friends ''
weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ; they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right _RARE_ and _RARE_ their marriage
thing that had ever come between them was that _RARE_ , _RARE_ sister of his
sick of it
, at last '' , she said , because Susan was _RARE_ down the stairs
like an _RARE_ baby nurse ; ; her arms were straining with a burden of dolls
ready '' , she announced
you need that big bundle ''

had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment
that _RARE_ ''
at him with hurt blue eyes that _RARE_ an instant grief ; ; to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart
, now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , _RARE_ _RARE_
father didn't mean it , Susan ''
Jim a quick , _RARE_ look of warning
take every one of them ''
, but he lifted _RARE_ suitcase and said , in a _RARE_ tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand
you get back from _RARE_ , Cathy will be here to play with you

'' , Susan said , _RARE_ with her _RARE_ _RARE_ of dolls with a _RARE_ effect
this point , Lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little _RARE_ sharing dolls -- but she could _RARE_ with Susan ; ; there ought to be a limit to sharing , too
one more reason she didn't look forward to _RARE_ visit , short or long ; ; the last one had been a _RARE_ war
that Cathy had been _RARE_ with Susan for attention that she had never had
'' , Jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all ''
car , with _RARE_ hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , Lucy stood looking after its pale dust
was brilliant around her -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ with breeze -- yet her inner _RARE_ darkened it
let Jim go with a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a _RARE_ kiss
sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that
and began to walk toward the house
feeding station , the _RARE_ group of _RARE_ again _RARE_ and _RARE_ over the ground , but now , _RARE_ among them , was a beautiful red _RARE_ , _RARE_ in its _RARE_ _RARE_
bird was solitary ; ; its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest
better stay there , Lucy thought ; ; the _RARE_ female _RARE_ took instant advantage of _RARE_ without _RARE_
Lucy
to herself , _RARE_ the _RARE_ and the _RARE_
a day of things to do ; ; among them , she had to prepare the guest room
would it be occupied
, with a _RARE_ feeling of _RARE_
as the _RARE_ Myra chose
moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself
only birds that _RARE_ their children in other _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room
new yellow curtains , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new _RARE_ , _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ , and hanging from the ceiling was an _RARE_ Mother _RARE_ _RARE_ , spinning slowly in the breeze
of little _RARE_ waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ; since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed
was faintly _RARE_ with _RARE_ , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a _RARE_ ghost : Greg's house , on the day he was _RARE_ , and the child , pale , silent , _RARE_ , watching the funeral guests with _RARE_ eyes
since his death that memory had worried and troubled her
the hall , the upstairs phone _RARE_ , and the small ghost vanished
picked up the receiver , her mother's _RARE_ voice was there
_RARE_ calling '' , she said
just thought I'd let you know
Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago
_RARE_ sooner but I've been busy ''
can imagine ''
an active character ; ; for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be _RARE_ now , surrounded by her _RARE_ of dolls
out the chair and sat down ; ; she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her
think yourself as grown up as _RARE_ , yet the _RARE_ voice still kept its comforting magic
was Cathy ''

was the _RARE_ widow I ever saw ''
way to the _RARE_ , on her way to Paris -- you bet , Lucy said to herself
been fixing up the guest room for Cathy ''
a _RARE_ pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay ''
for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them ''
'' -- This time there was a long silence , while the telephone _RARE_ faintly with a _RARE_ life
Lucy stared at the _RARE_ wallpaper ; ; her mother was _RARE_ ; ; she was not usually given to mysterious _RARE_
thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good
mean once Myra gets to Paris ''
soft , pretty _RARE_ found the bright light she had always wanted
_RARE_ , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know ''
was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do
Myra left -- She was saying _RARE_ to Cathy , and she didn't realize I was near ''
, as though hunting over words and ways of putting them
was in tears , of course , and I heard Myra say , ' Now be good , and at _RARE_ I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris ' ''
, Lucy sat there
jumped to her feet , the _RARE_ phone cord _RARE_ like a black snake

it was no _RARE_ she had dreamed up ; ; it was only too true
no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks
moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger _RARE_ it
does it ''

keep Cathy for two weeks
if Myra does nothing about _RARE_ her , I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself ''
tightened on the receiver
that's what I'm going to tell Jim ''
, the day's nagging _RARE_ had come to an abrupt end
hung up , she saw through the _RARE_ open window the _RARE_ flying of the _RARE_ wings , and heard their _RARE_ singing

going to get away with it
tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path
thin legs were _RARE_
along slowly , both hands clutching a tired _RARE_ bear
at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her _RARE_ and _RARE_ house
, she was traveling light ; ; the worn _RARE_ bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had
at the _RARE_ case , knew there would not be enough in it for the _RARE_ of _RARE_ ; ; they would have to buy things for her
the door
the dog _RARE_ on the sand
blame Maggie for _RARE_
days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before _RARE_ Beach got _RARE_ with tourists and beach balls and _RARE_ _RARE_
sand made _RARE_ limp more pronounced
slowly past the _RARE_ _RARE_ -- eleven lemon , nine _RARE_ , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` _RARE_ '' sign _RARE_ in the wind
were in friendly territory

sand and a ridge of rocks _RARE_ _RARE_ to the _RARE_ edge
was to the right of a _RARE_ _RARE_ , a big , brown , _RARE_ rock _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
was special because no one on the beach could see him here
was enclosed and safe
a _RARE_ or a sea _RARE_ came along , didn't he have a red _RARE_ hunting knife on his belt -- ten _RARE_ and a _RARE_
was a perfect place to lie down and make believe
_RARE_ controlling the waves
a _RARE_ of the _RARE_ Table , `` Sir _RARE_ the _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ evil spirits and _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_
good thing about a suit of _RARE_ , his leg wouldn't show
was the first _RARE_ on the moon , chosen because of his small size and _RARE_ nature
six feet one like his father , with big hands and a _RARE_ chest , a man the weak and _RARE_ would turn to

when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being _RARE_ by not turning on the bathroom light
bathroom can be pretty _RARE_ , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : _RARE_ , for sure , I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad
intended to make the promise
two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America
of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint
right
''
remember the feel of his father's big hands , the _RARE_ of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar
talk about the beach

gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear
I can put two fingers between the _RARE_ in the back of your neck
says swimming would help your leg
you're _RARE_ more than you need to ''
does he know
nut
had _RARE_ ''
light from the _RARE_ table his father looked so worried that the promise _RARE_ out
just wait , Dad
get back I'll _RARE_ be swimming better than Victoria
see , Dad ''
fourteen months younger than Quint , a head taller , and could _RARE_ any boy or girl on the beach
her `` _RARE_ ''
him `` _RARE_ -- that's why nobody plays with you , Mister _RARE_ ''
what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at _RARE_ : `` Please , Lord _RARE_ , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised ''
got a nerve ''
now to the clouds
to _RARE_ up and down his chest
strong as a giant
his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg
his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming _RARE_
, _RARE_ '' , creaked a sea _RARE_
, shut up '' , he said
on the rock , a skinny , _RARE_ boy surrounded by the ocean
_RARE_ a hole between his shoulder _RARE_ , and when he looked at the _RARE_ waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , _RARE_ between the rocks and the waves
go in
of the nightmare
he put on his clothes
with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water
it , big shot '' , a _RARE_ voice yelled back
holding on to his rock with one hand
of _RARE_
a bathing suit like his mother's , no _RARE_ on the _RARE_
didn't you duck ''

is my rock ''
''
''
''
''
_RARE_ as a _RARE_
hear of _RARE_ rights ''

with the _RARE_ Bill of eighteen '' -- `` Mister Big _RARE_ , aren't you ''
Mark _RARE_ _RARE_ the Fifth
me Quint ''
why don't you stop _RARE_ ''
said Quint
for _RARE_
Latin means '' -- `` I can speak both kinds of Latin , smart _RARE_ ''
sounded like cloth _RARE_
shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ voice
don't smoke ''
_RARE_
you ''
, yes ''
said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum
eleven , fourteen a day ''
I was your _RARE_ , I'd _RARE_ your tail off ''
mother never _RARE_ me
this leg brace ''
so _RARE_ that he was obliged to roll up his blue _RARE_ so she could see his brace
'' , was what she said
don't you paint it red and white like a _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
maybe I won't have to wear it always
says if I exercise my leg more , maybe I can use a cane when I'm big ''
a _RARE_ of water into the air
_RARE_ mighty _RARE_
past , you want to stop him , _RARE_ , _RARE_ him around the neck with the _RARE_ in your cane
a _RARE_ brings you a bowl of _RARE_ with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is _RARE_ , _RARE_ your cane on the floor
will you look at that ''
_RARE_ himself awake and was _RARE_ the sand off his _RARE_ _RARE_ and his long _RARE_ of a tail
some dog
''
_RARE_ , part _RARE_ _RARE_ ''

did when people asked
_RARE_ , that's the most unique dog I ever saw '' , she said firmly
real _RARE_ _RARE_ , only we call him Maggie because he has to take _RARE_
than he looks
sick lately
he went on a ham _RARE_ ''
what ''
have told her , but Victoria was _RARE_
`` Mama wants you Quint
or I'll come find you ''
_RARE_ go
this is my rock , you can use it sometimes
early in the morning ''
do I
around , Mister _RARE_ ''
how they started being friends
next morning and all the mornings thereafter
, early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ; it made her _RARE_
was Sabella , and the strip of _RARE_ around her neck was an _RARE_ _RARE_ the King gave her as a _RARE_ of his _RARE_ love
going to marry the King ''

a long beard and _RARE_ his teeth with a fork
is what he's _RARE_ about
hair runs in my family
I prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the _RARE_ , ' What can one do ' ''
_RARE_ ''
one , I been there ''
she said , smelled _RARE_ because people let dead fish lie on the _RARE_ till the fish got hard as rocks ; ; then they scraped off the mold and made fish _RARE_

_RARE_ had _RARE_
the _RARE_ drove their _RARE_ down to the beach and _RARE_ and drank and fought all night
dancing -- _RARE_ _RARE_ , he ought to see the _RARE_ in _RARE_ ; ; they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them
''
a _RARE_
better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so
as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy _RARE_ in the _RARE_ War ; ; that his baby sister could _RARE_ up through her nose when she felt like it ; ; that he personally had an _RARE_ of _RARE_ and was currently reading the _RARE_ to _RARE_ volume of the _RARE_
are for _RARE_ ''
a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , _RARE_ laugh he liked to hear
appreciated his _RARE_ as much as Sabella
What did one _RARE_ say to the other _RARE_
dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight ''
What time did the _RARE_ go to the _RARE_

by her _RARE_ he _RARE_ Maggie who was crazy about ham
the ham _RARE_ with _RARE_ and _RARE_ , cooling on the porch
up on the ham like Maggie , _RARE_ it with soft , _RARE_ teeth , then panting with _RARE_ , _RARE_ up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a _RARE_ , _RARE_ home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it
has to go ''
, you're quite a _RARE_ '' , Sabella said _RARE_
thought about going on the stage ''

was such a nice thought that he nodded his head
that or a _RARE_ ''
make up your mind , son '' , Sabella said
can't serve _RARE_ and _RARE_ ''
argued
_RARE_ have no bones and _RARE_ _RARE_ backward
agreed with Sabella
he tied a bunch of sea _RARE_ with _RARE_ and threw them across the _RARE_ _RARE_ to the rock where she was swimming around
could she catch
_RARE_ in the _RARE_
gave me flowers before
, Quint ''
turned pink with pleasure and a _RARE_ cough
can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain _RARE_ _RARE_ say _RARE_ ''
didn't talk at all
on the rock while she _RARE_ and _RARE_ around
she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` Don't feel like it '' , he was _RARE_ to tell her about being scared
began _RARE_ just then and he went home , carrying Sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , _RARE_ of _RARE_
his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , _RARE_ of time
it happened
eating breakfast
_RARE_ _RARE_ , Lord _RARE_ , to _RARE_ this food '' -- that was Victoria saying grace while the baby _RARE_ _RARE_ toast on her plastic _RARE_
breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement
_RARE_ in San Francisco '' , she told them
says he'll be here on the _RARE_ plane
early -- isn't that wonderful ''
, keen ''
seemed to be opening in _RARE_ stomach
, we'll have to get organized
can have an early _RARE_
I want you to -- '' Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared
up , we're late '' , he said , _RARE_ with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the _RARE_ waves sending off sheets of blue and _RARE_ green
in his stomach hurt
to go into the water
Sabella about the nightmare
started two years ago when he was in an iron lung
it , he didn't know
collar _RARE_ his neck
much
weight on his chest
it together meant _RARE_
time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second
Evans smashed up his car , the _RARE_ his wife Linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an _RARE_ golf at _RARE_ , it seemed to mark the end of a long , _RARE_ chapter in the social life of the community
remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath
Linda was _RARE_ , not that she would do anything _RARE_ or in bad taste any more than John Cooper would
been a perfect wife to Bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years
Cooper even more attractive at _RARE_ than he had been twenty-five years earlier
John's wife , Edythe , even more _RARE_ , if possible
Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life
adult and realistic to look at it that way

that John Cooper had married Edythe on the _RARE_
the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his
course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie _RARE_ said to Linda Stuart
John ''
the _RARE_ , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of _RARE_ when she was by all odds the _RARE_ and _RARE_ young woman west of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , and John was surely one of the _RARE_ and _RARE_ young men around _RARE_
had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two _RARE_ before at the _RARE_ Club to the _RARE_ _RARE_ not only of the stag line but even of her fellow _RARE_
claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ still around his eyes
them always together those years
about _RARE_ as an _RARE_
at _RARE_ _RARE_ last night ; ; _RARE_ drove to _RARE_ in three and a half hours
was a spat over something , as there had been _RARE_ _RARE_ before ; ; only this one didn't _RARE_
said `` _RARE_ '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or _RARE_
worse instead of better
it came out after Mr. _RARE_ will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more
there was _RARE_ engagement to Bobbie Evans
no connection between the two events , because Bobbie wasn't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John
a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did
said Linda had just announced the engagement to _RARE_ John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to _RARE_ with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be _RARE_ even to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
even John and Edythe
simply Poor John
nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either
had been to school with her _RARE_ near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at _RARE_
, you shouldn't _RARE_ Edythe '' , Mousie said
know she gives the impression of being _RARE_ and frivolous and _RARE_
frivolous and _RARE_ , but she really isn't _RARE_ ''
Linda looked magnificent at their wedding
at the church with Edythe
during the ceremony , and Mousie _RARE_ , who was one of _RARE_ _RARE_ , said John _RARE_ black as death at her
if he were choking '' , she said
John ''
down to become a social myth and a _RARE_ example
never seemed to be in place and her _RARE_ were never quite the correct length
have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at _RARE_ _RARE_ , but her bathing suits were far from smart
didn't see her much at _RARE_ _RARE_ or anywhere , for John had _RARE_ away from the gang
it was because he was too proud to stand pity
he couldn't stand seeing Linda , Mrs. Bobbie Evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything
_RARE_ reasons too
died not long after his marriage , and there was even less Cooper money left
the big old place in _RARE_ and bought a smaller house in _RARE_ _RARE_
not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day
good at his job
wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the _RARE_ with nothing but Edythe to come home to
may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John's first son , came along early in _RARE_ , the _RARE_ baby you ever saw and a _RARE_ that he looked all Cooper from _RARE_ to pink toes , _RARE_ a trace of Edythe
continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in _RARE_ and Jack in 1944 -- and all John's success at his work only made _RARE_ _RARE_ and general _RARE_ more _RARE_
could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda
was bridge at _RARE_ house , the cards _RARE_ like wet _RARE_ _RARE_ and the food probably was wet _RARE_ _RARE_
a _RARE_ drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , who'd never _RARE_ more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a _RARE_ in what Edythe called `` the _RARE_ of the church ''
find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually _RARE_ , which was a real bit of luck for the _RARE_
intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile
was the kind of stock that keeps a _RARE_ without _RARE_ and maybe _RARE_ over backward to keep a bad one
an _RARE_ and generous husband , _RARE_ , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him
got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ; after the war back to the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the steel company
saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary
been successful , too , though he didn't match John's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the Stuart money
Linda settled down to being social leaders , and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year
came the _RARE_ turn , the smashed _RARE_ and Linda , _RARE_ alone and lovely
his or her breath
think Linda couldn't have got John back any time , if she'd tried '' , Mousie _RARE_ , who had been Mousie _RARE_ , said between _RARE_ of a chicken sandwich at a _RARE_ table at _RARE_ _RARE_
you know she _RARE_ , but she isn't that kind of girl
-- well , it would be a _RARE_ , I think
''
felt more _RARE_ than she had ever dreamed _RARE_ death could move her to feeling
felt was a _RARE_ loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much _RARE_ for handsome , ambitious Bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death
what people were thinking ; ; it was what she had been thinking herself
up to her to save Poor John , dear John , to _RARE_ the wrong she had done , but she _RARE_ at the decision as at the _RARE_ of a cold stream
no one who would blame her or John ; ; she could be sure of that
be rough on Edythe at first , but Linda and John between them could make a _RARE_ handsome enough to _RARE_ her , to send her back to _RARE_ or anywhere
felt capable of _RARE_ the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of their own
be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of
have to wait , she knew
was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by
watching while Poor John struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead
, he had done _RARE_
and regular _RARE_ had different sales departments at Smith & _RARE_ , where John and Bobbie both worked
been head of the _RARE_ division , while John was just another good salesman in the regular branch
old Mr. _RARE_ , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular _RARE_ had gone with _RARE_ , it looked like the perfect chance for Bobbie
knew how to help her husband , not just the _RARE_ contacts but also the little dinners for _RARE_ _RARE_
almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job
did you do ''
Bobbie
must have done something , something wrong
I had everything set for you ''
something about damned _RARE_ _RARE_ together , and Linda got angry at him
their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk
her uncle , Donald _RARE_ , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened
a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision
old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which _RARE_ and even some _RARE_ couldn't understand
tell her of the long board meeting where Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other
behind John Cooper '' , Mr. _RARE_ said finally
think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of _RARE_
, I believe Poor _RARE_ work just a little harder
wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance
with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities
, the money can't mean as much to Bobbie
will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ; Poor John will take it as a _RARE_ and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights _RARE_ about us ''
the _RARE_ nodded
_RARE_ found himself _RARE_ agreement too
surprise was over , Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck , though she agreed with _RARE_ decision some months later to move to _RARE_ _RARE_
at _RARE_ wasn't particularly better , but it got him away from being _RARE_ to John and assured him steady _RARE_ , since _RARE_ was owned to a large degree by various branches of _RARE_ family
rise continued to be _RARE_
was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief _RARE_ in a series on national business leaders of the future
then to say she had a _RARE_ for that night
appreciated the chance to make some money
nice little thing -- lives right in the building ''
_RARE_ '' , I said _RARE_
get along without that three dollars
ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer _RARE_ to Nadine
past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang
through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour
to find Nadine at the other end
scared me half to death '' , I said _RARE_
wrong ''
, nobody answers at the apartment ''
came shrill
absolutely frantic
girl might have gone off and left _RARE_ ''
, she wouldn't do that '' , I said
probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone
you're worried you can go home and check '' -- `` I can't leave the party
Ken _RARE_ apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat
_RARE_ is already down on Wally , and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us '' -- I was all set for what came next
, could you possibly go over and make sure _RARE_ all right
you there in ten minutes '' -- `` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- _RARE_ , as I said it , why I should make it at all
I go over at midnight to check on _RARE_ , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party
minutes , then
_RARE_
glad to pay you '' -- So sure that money could do anything
right '' , I said
it
the dollar or so Nadine would give me
there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would
sound asleep , and I didn't see any sense in waking him
in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened
off through the cool darkness to _RARE_ apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door
was flushed from sleep
all right '' , I said , as she started to look scared
Roberts had called , and couldn't wake you
came over to make sure everything was all right ''
-- hard to wake up '' , she _RARE_
look over _RARE_
insisted that her _RARE_ be reliable
have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on
didn't know it was going to be this late ''
started ringing
Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said
answer it ''
the _RARE_ furnished living room to the pale yellow phone
Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home
, would you mind _RARE_ ''
a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying
drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can , but I don't want _RARE_ to see him like this
how _RARE_ of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' -- Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done
clicked in my ear
even give me a chance to refuse
there wasn't any law that said I had to stay
I looked at _RARE_ and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk
told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she _RARE_ off to her own apartment
looked in at _RARE_ , I went into the living room and waited
have _RARE_ off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices
shrill with anger -- _RARE_ loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two
the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him
always thought she was so beautiful
she looked ugly
was stretched so tight that her _RARE_ stuck out , and if looks could kill , Wally would have been dead
your clothes '' , she _RARE_
-- and get out ''
crazy '' , Wally said _RARE_
and stumbled to the _RARE_ and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep
over to him , and her pointed _RARE_ _RARE_ across his face
her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right , and she was crazy
stay out of this '' , she spat at me
ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us
Ken _RARE_ ''
were wild
told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman
other people there were listening
and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' -- `` you'd better _RARE_ down '' , I said _RARE_
plenty scared
state she was in , she could actually kill him
you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' -- `` _RARE_ , '' Nadine _RARE_
can you be so damn stupid
his job
never forgive him -- never
don't have any money -- we don't have a _RARE_
own is _RARE_ bedroom set and the _RARE_ player and we even owe on them
be poor and have to live in a _RARE_ little house like yours -- and all because of that '' -- I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of _RARE_
that
up the whole building
go any place at this hour '' -- `` Well then , I'll get out '' -- But she looked uncertain
coming to her _RARE_ enough to realize that you don't go _RARE_ off anywhere at two in the morning
go to bed '' , I said _RARE_
the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' -- She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped
her into bed , and sat with her until she had _RARE_ herself out
three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go
her , a limp bundle of _RARE_ , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her
snoring on the _RARE_
done all I could
done all I was going to do
not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine
home , found Chris still asleep
up close to him -- _RARE_ him -- _RARE_ for a man like him
wasn't Nadine
on being _RARE_
afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with _RARE_
in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry
had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much
got fired yesterday for not _RARE_ to business '' -- Old Mr. _RARE_ himself had stopped at the service station for a _RARE_ job , Wally _RARE_ , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the _RARE_ waiting to be repaired
the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side
had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him
thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said _RARE_
Ken got _RARE_ and wouldn't make any promises
was _RARE_ and I blew my _RARE_ '' -- `` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman ''
to quiet Nadine because the children were there
was beyond caring what she said
may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern
couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved
they'd realize that life can be tough
bubble _RARE_ , there's nothing
little , during the week , Chris and I discovered the crazy _RARE_ way Nadine and Wally had lived
not only spent every cent -- they were in _RARE_ up to their _RARE_ , _RARE_ on everything they owned
of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were _RARE_
all , Wally had no training for any kind of work
fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was _RARE_

wish we were in a position to offer a little money to _RARE_ them over ''
I wished we were , too
easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent
_RARE_ up like a candle
glad you feel that way , honey
one big way we can help them
let them move in with us '' -- Something I had simply never thought of
incredible -- I just stared at him
incredible -- He gave me an embarrassed , pleading look
know we'd be pretty crowded
would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out ''
-- They'd had years of making all that money
won't do it '' , I said _RARE_
was always too good to live in a little house like this
now she can sleep in the street for all I care ''
isn't like you , _RARE_ '' , Chris said _RARE_
felt uncomfortable , too
want to be like that , mean and bitter
_RARE_ it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled _RARE_ who had looked down their _RARE_ at us
in the end , we did
seemed as if there was nothing else to do
company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name
got sick
way of thinking , he was scared sick
had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world
trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of _RARE_ Nadine had bought on special
we'll eat , I thought grimly as I put all the food away
worked , Nadine sat and cried
wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally
_RARE_ nothing '' , she'd scream at him
too lazy to go out and look for another job
a _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
a mess , all right
couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks , Chris had said
I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks
two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us
nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed
out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of _RARE_ and _RARE_
had _RARE_ him
even take his application
can get something , '' Nadine would snap
can get a job working in a _RARE_ store , if nothing else ''
high school kids have got everything _RARE_ up '' , he said , a _RARE_ in his voice
damn _RARE_ -- taking work away from men who need it ''
fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging
was only the middle of July
couldn't take six more weeks of this
it to Chris one _RARE_ hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air
really believe in _RARE_
swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day
it was the weather , so _RARE_ it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital
it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late
rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all
just going to be one of those days
_RARE_ time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , _RARE_ , _RARE_ profession
the _RARE_ time , I answered myself
chosen medicine -- it had chosen me
I shouldn't _RARE_ , I told myself in the _RARE_ mirror
a lot to be _RARE_ for
that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be _RARE_ at
didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an _RARE_ or a _RARE_
, we were together and we had Mrs. _RARE_ , _RARE_ her , to look after us -- no mother could be _RARE_ of Gladdy than Mrs. _RARE_ was
lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it
the way Gladdy had turned out
without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been
_RARE_ start on Alice
a closed book , a picture I keep on my bureau , but never look at
kept on as she'd been going , the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow As usual , _RARE_ bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table
class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me
me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too
I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision
a feeling that young Pete _RARE_ , the most promising _RARE_ at _RARE_ , had something to do with it , too
out with Pete the night before and her gay _RARE_ about their date _RARE_ my mood a little
I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the _RARE_ returned
and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking
tell him the truth about Alice
have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years
were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to _RARE_
and _RARE_ _RARE_ , the other _RARE_
of _RARE_ here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds
down on Seven , _RARE_ told me , and he'd meet us there
anything of special interest that morning , no one _RARE_ than they should have been
to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he'd had a case of _RARE_ shock , but it was all taken care of now
a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then
finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor
a new one in last night '' , he said
haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a _RARE_ ''
surprised
was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female _RARE_
get many at _RARE_ and they were never pretty sights
thought _RARE_ to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular _RARE_ ward
I walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed
her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk
was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name
this woman's name was Rose _RARE_
at the chart for _RARE_
Rose _RARE_ , diagnosis : _RARE_ _RARE_
about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as _RARE_
scar _RARE_ the somewhat familiar _RARE_ face , already _RARE_ by the _RARE_ network of broken red _RARE_ that heavy _RARE_ carry
hair was _RARE_ -- _RARE_ blonde and its real , dirty gray
could it be
no it was an unfortunate _RARE_ , that was all it was , and I turned to _RARE_ , forcing myself to put my _RARE_ out of my mind
low voice , _RARE_ filled us in she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway
when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out
the old story
her a day or two , and the _RARE_ people would talk to her
she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left
the patient again , I -- I can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick
you , it took every _RARE_ of control I had to be able to speak
, Miss -- or is it Mrs. _RARE_ ''
liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it _RARE_ them , I've always thought , to _RARE_ first
one time I'd have _RARE_ broken my own rule , but habit was too strong
''
was flat and dull
_RARE_ eyes -- I had to turn my head away
then that I saw what the _RARE_ covers revealed
_RARE_ on the sheet
this ''

period ''
her head
been _RARE_ a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice
you spoken to a doctor about it ''
, there was a negative shake
Miss _RARE_ to move her down the hall where we had an _RARE_ table
do a _RARE_ '' , I told Pete
only a few moments before Miss _RARE_ had her in the proper position for a _RARE_ , but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination
by with a slide and took the _RARE_ , sent it down to the _RARE_ with a request for the test
, I told Miss _RARE_ to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind
busy the rest of the day
the afternoon , I was up on Seven again
my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled
way to the elevator , I ran into Pete
got the results on the _RARE_ _RARE_ test '' , he said
something there , all right
, they said
want to talk to her , _RARE_ ''
'' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again
was ridiculous , of course
right
a D. and C. and get her permission for a _RARE_
nothing , maybe it's _RARE_ or in _RARE_ -- can't take any chances ''
you can keep her here that long '' , Pete said _RARE_
tells me she's started _RARE_ already , wants to get out
get to her _RARE_ , I guess ''
in _RARE_
, better see what I can do ''
standing right outside Miss _RARE_ door and as I went to turn the _RARE_ to enter , I was surprised to find that the door was slightly _RARE_
seemed to be _RARE_ and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones
opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an _RARE_ _RARE_
sure can't _RARE_ about the service in this place '' , she said
just got through seeing one of you guys
you want ''
something almost _RARE_ in her tone , but I _RARE_ it
just been talking to Dr. _RARE_ '' , I said
like you to have a _RARE_ and _RARE_
minor , nothing to worry about
would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it _RARE_ necessary ''
''
flat , definite
you let me explain
I rather doubt that we'll have to do this
we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably ''
sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor
''
at her in amazement
patients who'd refused _RARE_ before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why
it was fear , but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the _RARE_
you tell me why ''

, a smile without humor
shouldn't tell your little _RARE_ outside of the patient's door '' , she said
got _RARE_ , haven't I ''
on , _RARE_ my _RARE_
not going to be one of your _RARE_ _RARE_
pupils learn on someone else , _RARE_
me die in peace ''
at her , almost _RARE_
speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was
voice had taken on a more _RARE_ tone
someone who'd come down in the world , I thought
, long way down
was something familiar about her , something -- `` You haven't got _RARE_ '' , I said as strongly as I could
don't know what you heard that would make you think so , but I assure you I don't even know myself , so how can you be so sure
if '' -- `` Don't give me a lot of talk , Joe ''
at her
have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult
was that something , some _RARE_ in the way she spoke
watching me _RARE_ , a funny little _RARE_ on her lips
, baby
changed , haven't I
haven't changed much , Joe ''
then , knew with a _RARE_ shock
'' -- I _RARE_ through dry lips
, for goodness sake '' -- `` Alice '' , she _RARE_ _RARE_
the matter , Joe , you scared of me
going to make you _RARE_ a drunk as your wife
don't worry
me _RARE_ here '' -- `` But why did you come back ''
my voice
have you been all these years ''

and there
coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where I was when I came to
thing I remember is a bar in San _RARE_ '' -- The way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her _RARE_ _RARE_ , made me _RARE_
was _RARE_ mother
never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now
_RARE_ here
are all _RARE_ -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good
I want out , Joe ''
at the _RARE_ _RARE_ of a woman before me
out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it
said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me
let her go , she'd _RARE_ once more
would be safe
slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea
me welcome
cool _RARE_ were _RARE_ than any woman's ; ; the many little _RARE_ she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen _RARE_
she _RARE_ me , and drew me deeper into her
longer knew how deep I was , somewhere under _RARE_ feet , getting _RARE_ , _RARE_ and more _RARE_ by the second
for this dive seemed foolish now
dive itself had any meaning
nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the _RARE_ and _RARE_ in the sweet water
I took off the _RARE_ I could _RARE_ better , love my woman better
aloud , and the _RARE_ fell out
_RARE_ part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part _RARE_ over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time
when I packed up what _RARE_ I had and went to Paris
no vacation , just me getting out after a _RARE_
it wouldn't be the same
never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind
I had been to Paris , long before I married _RARE_
time was good and it stuck with me
_RARE_ back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at _RARE_ instead of _RARE_
a Saturday evening in April with a _RARE_ rain , and I was a little high on the good taste of life
a _RARE_ of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be _RARE_ all night
than an hour I had gotten a hotel , _RARE_ , shaved and was out on the _RARE_ _RARE_ in a fresh uniform
like a _RARE_ in Rome
women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ; everything was _RARE_ to my _RARE_ eyes
some sweet machines other than women : an old _RARE_ , a lean _RARE_ _RARE_ on an American _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , a type _RARE_ _RARE_ and lots more
the _RARE_ de _RARE_ and the _RARE_ _RARE_ -- I was no _RARE_ , but I was young , and this was Paris
champagne at _RARE_ , then went into a _RARE_ called the _RARE_ et _RARE_ to ask the way to _RARE_
got there
Claire , which was better
eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine

know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful
blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress
_RARE_ eating wasn't _RARE_ because she was so positive about it
had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said : `` _RARE_ soldier , I have _RARE_ one hunger with food
another of terrible _RARE_
evening free ''
'' , I said with _RARE_ _RARE_ because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah ''
off we went to her apartment
a _RARE_ , of course , the poor girl
break of day I _RARE_ philosophical , and drew _RARE_ about her way of eating bread and cheese
was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned
there on a Saturday evening
the mistake of going to the _RARE_ et _RARE_
was busy but I didn't feel like a _RARE_
waiting for Life to come along and _RARE_ me up
part of a bottle of French beer called _RARE_ _RARE_ ( so help me ) , then switched to _RARE_
few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was _RARE_
to my hotel and slept
morning a little _RARE_ made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning
drank more _RARE_
day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ and the _RARE_ of _RARE_
but sex
was on my mind
turning over the idea of a good _RARE_ when I _RARE_ off
better Tuesday evening when I woke up
was clear , my thinking sober and I was _RARE_ to this Paris idea as a _RARE_ on top of all my others
_RARE_ has that kind of therapeutic value
the weather had turned cold and it was _RARE_
out into it
around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park , and I sat down on a _RARE_ bench where the light was dim and came from the sky
dignity and beauty in the little white _RARE_ falling through the blue night
on only a _RARE_ , but I wasn't cold
just miserable
a woman came along carrying a folded _RARE_ as a walking stick
me and sat down beside me , three feet away
understood why she had the _RARE_
her _RARE_ and _RARE_
she would have been _RARE_ and limp
her _RARE_
her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle
imagine her without it
all about her
another human being and happened to be a _RARE_
much care if she were there or not
while she said with sort of an _RARE_ laugh , `` You have snow in your hair and ears ''
didn't have on a hat
glancing at her , I smiled a _RARE_ one which said , _RARE_ , baby , but I'd rather be alone
silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy ''
not unhappy '' , I _RARE_ , staring at the snow
trying to make a hole in my _RARE_ , and I didn't want it
it a woman ''
gently
have seen the ring on my left hand
-- women and _RARE_ go together '' , I observed _RARE_ , adding , `` You can _RARE_ your _RARE_ on that ''
, Monsieur , it is not my business to _RARE_ it
took me so funny I had to look at her
my frozen sad face _RARE_ , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped
_RARE_ a _RARE_
at me , but it was an awfully sad smile
even more miserable than me
were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was _RARE_ and infinite wisdom in them
isn't it better to smile ''

liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me ''
see the ancient _RARE_ _RARE_ itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same _RARE_
I pulled a bottle of _RARE_ Martin out of my _RARE_ , drew the _RARE_ , and passed it to her
see she was shocked
sorry I haven't got a glass '' , I said
, _RARE_ '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry ''
up and drank , and then I drank
_RARE_ to drink good _RARE_ like that , but I hadn't cared before
going to _RARE_ around a glass
much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well
, this _RARE_ , she must have been _RARE_ or even forty
be sure
was attractive
looking , but _RARE_ and wise so that it made her attractive
her , and all at once I was glad she was there
the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober
we were cold , but we didn't feel it
to be _RARE_ , sadly , _RARE_ , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell
said , `` _RARE_ '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word
no stranger in her
and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with _RARE_
_RARE_ was the best estimate of her age
a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side
we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the _RARE_ had _RARE_
wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's _RARE_
was clear
hungry as a _RARE_ , and my body felt lean and vital
_RARE_ '' , I said _RARE_ , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips
good , with her short _RARE_ hair and no _RARE_
to thirty , I thought
_RARE_ ''
, smiling
_RARE_ ''
, but breakfast first ''
laugh she beat me to the bathroom
downstairs for food and a _RARE_ for her
out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my _RARE_
brushed my teeth , _RARE_ , shaved and dressed by the time a _RARE_ _RARE_ in breakfast
_RARE_ Monsieur '' , he said , _RARE_ it
it to the woman
is this for ''
_RARE_
, to brush your teeth ''
I already have
yours ''
''
with round eyes
if I ought to go use the new one myself
smelled the coffee , and thinking , What the hell , live _RARE_ , I decided I would _RARE_ my worries away
wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good
the _RARE_ away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot _RARE_ eggs and hot _RARE_ bread
ate , we talked
was _RARE_ , and mine _RARE_
back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee
are very _RARE_ , do you know , _RARE_ '' , she remarked
''
, _RARE_
, because you didn't run off to use that new _RARE_ ''
my eyes to look at her in the mirror
didn't really use yours '' , she went on
carry one in my purse
men never kiss _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
_RARE_ relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` Shall we go to the _RARE_ today ''
right ''
with enthusiasm at the idea
not immediately ''
aside my empty cup
all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own
not rushed
is this from ''
, touching the scar on her stomach
like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle
bullet '' , she answered
was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and I wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all
sex anyway , and played at it well
to the _RARE_ for a few hours , then by _RARE_ to a _RARE_ in _RARE_
a nice place , not filled with smoke
champagne and _RARE_ _RARE_
brought the wine first , a _RARE_ instead of the bottle I had ordered
have thought I was a tourist
him with a _RARE_ eye and said , `` What's this for
ask for a _RARE_ of champagne ''
that was pretty _RARE_ , but I didn't laugh
had arrived for Miss Theresa _RARE_ : she put them in her bag
not stop to read them in American _RARE_ , as many were doing , sitting on _RARE_ or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street
her first day in Rome and it was June
sky of the most delicate blue _RARE_ overhead
_RARE_ eye -- her imagination _RARE_ fully , almost _RARE_ , to these _RARE_ peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , _RARE_ on its great bare _RARE_ that the _RARE_ marked , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , here a _RARE_ , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills
old Latin books returned to her : the _RARE_ _RARE_ Today , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ of _RARE_
see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight
nursing various _RARE_ -- her _RARE_ , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy _RARE_ ( everybody could tell you the _RARE_ were always sick ) , Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot
France , Germany , _RARE_ , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of _RARE_ and _RARE_ , she had conceived a _RARE_ passion by _RARE_ , to see all these places with her own eyes
night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go
to stop me now
it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly _RARE_
street the traffic was really _RARE_
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ all went _RARE_ at once down the narrow length of it or _RARE_ _RARE_ around a fountain
tourists went by her in national groups -- English school girls in blue uniforms , German boys with _RARE_ attached , _RARE_ dressed Americans looking in shop windows
be alone , Theresa climbed the _RARE_ _RARE_ staircase that opened to her left
_RARE_
was going on here just now -- the annual display of _RARE_ plants
heard about it the night before at her hotel
not yet complete : _RARE_ were _RARE_ the _RARE_ plants from a truck and placing them in _RARE_ rows on the steps above
were as large as _RARE_ , and their _RARE_ _RARE_ , many still tight in the _RARE_ , ranged in color from _RARE_ through _RARE_ and rose to the _RARE_ pink , along with many white ones too
thought Theresa , climbing in her _RARE_ , _RARE_ way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything
, all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed
the staircase she stopped and sat down
were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide _RARE_ and leaning over the _RARE_ above , watching the _RARE_ mass , or just enjoying the sun
with her letters in her lap , breathing _RARE_ air
warmed her , as it seemed to be _RARE_ everything , perhaps even the _RARE_ of _RARE_ or the chill _RARE_ of _RARE_
her _RARE_ jacket and smoked a cigarette
; ; how could you be both at once
but she was
she picked up the first of the letters
moments later her hands were trembling and her _RARE_ had _RARE_ with anxiety and _RARE_
, one of them would have to go and do this
Elec , she thought , tears rising to _RARE_ in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer
on earth did I ever get this letter anyway
reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her
Emma _RARE_ had written it , in her loose high old _RARE_ _RARE_ -- _RARE_ carefully crossed , but _RARE_ inclined to _RARE_ like an old car on the downward slope
had simply put Miss Theresa _RARE_ , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in _RARE_ , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her _RARE_ _RARE_
address _RARE_
_RARE_ American _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
the envelope , and now Theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the President of the Republic or the Pope
all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last _RARE_ , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander _RARE_
and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- _RARE_ , devoted , _RARE_ -- had lived next door to the _RARE_ in _RARE_ from time _RARE_ until the _RARE_ had moved to _RARE_ fifteen years ago
before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out _RARE_ about what too much rain might do to his _RARE_ , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a _RARE_ paper knife which Theresa had _RARE_ as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died
to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh
would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it
the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother George
George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to _RARE_ to Cousin _RARE_ funeral
full of heavy family _RARE_
fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today
children had suffered from the _RARE_ of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his _RARE_ ( he had one so far , still in _RARE_ ) , he _RARE_ to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all
of _RARE_ and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand

boy , the family darling
her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong
seen him through the right college , into the right _RARE_ , and though _RARE_ by various girls and various _RARE_ of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George
just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull
Cousin Alexander _RARE_ , the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had _RARE_ long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole _RARE_ family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin _RARE_ call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George
all did their _RARE_ to help Cousin Elec get a _RARE_ out of his foot
_RARE_ downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his _RARE_ , on a _RARE_
his long _RARE_ foot in both hands , and this and his _RARE_ face -- he was trying _RARE_ not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey
surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have _RARE_ , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a _RARE_ of hot water which she poured _RARE_ into a white _RARE_ pan
you think of anything to do ''
_RARE_
hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to
think of anything to do ''
might treat it like the _RARE_ '' , said Papa
a cold key down his back ''
just hope this happens to you _RARE_ '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best
Cousin Elec '' , George said
younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not _RARE_
Cousin Elec ''
here they both were , still the same , George full of _RARE_ _RARE_ , and Cousin Emma in despair
to a new page
course ( _RARE_ letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered
is alone in that big old house and won't hear to _RARE_ from it
_RARE_ tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here , but I think she feels that she might be an _RARE_ , especially as long as our _RARE_ is still in high school
possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that _RARE_ is _RARE_ with -- Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ , for example
is more in this than meets the eye
bathroom would certainly have to be put in
in the back bedroom is literally _RARE_ off
Theresa skipped a page of details about the house
I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them
settle on some _RARE_ arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best
really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick
_RARE_ in a minute , sitting on these cold steps
up , standing _RARE_ for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men
shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked _RARE_ black and slick
they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so
a man approached her with a tray of cheap _RARE_ , Parker fountain _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
'' , said Theresa
, no ''

did not wish to leave
how to spread himself against the _RARE_ of the space that had to separate them
in the park , the _RARE_ by moonlight , he specialized
away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two
walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of _RARE_ , while the _RARE_ picked himself another _RARE_ American lady , carrying a camera and a handsome _RARE_ bag , _RARE_ the steps alone
ever successful , Theresa wondered
with the _RARE_ bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ; at last , alarm
about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed
she _RARE_ away up the steps
, still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an _RARE_ between Cousin _RARE_ death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma
even , Anne and George , probably thinking themselves very _RARE_ in not _RARE_ that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in August to get Cousin _RARE_ house ready before the teachers came to _RARE_ in September
, it wasn't Anne and _RARE_ fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren't they always _RARE_ that they really didn't know what they would do without Theresa
is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter _RARE_ , nothing here is supposed even to exist
not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow
registered with them that I had time to read all of _RARE_ , Dickens , and _RARE_ while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after _RARE_ operation
have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all _RARE_ volumes of _RARE_ _RARE_
the letters carefully , one on top of the other
with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two
''
aware that two Italian _RARE_ , carrying a large _RARE_ pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_
Oh put it there ''
a spot a little distance away
it as surely as everybody in _RARE_ -- that Lucille was a husband _RARE_
keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only _RARE_
been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren
it has its Susan _RARE_ , though _RARE_ ever bothered to tell me that
, that's me
talked about Lucille down at the Young _RARE_ _RARE_ where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission
heard my folks talk about her , though
_RARE_ religious people , and I can _RARE_ say I never heard them spread any _RARE_ about anybody
they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me
and my faith protected me from things like that
I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren
him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck
him if it was true
me a straight , honest answer
, _RARE_ baby '' , he'd said
I love you -- well , a _RARE_ a guy and _RARE_ willing to -- to come across
_RARE_ , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much ''
it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren
didn't seem fair
for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't _RARE_ to use her sex
a _RARE_ with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the _RARE_ line
a vivid , sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff Dad had ordered
in the habit of _RARE_ my eyes at delivery men , but the moment I saw Johnnie , I knew he was different
only different -- he was it
an easy _RARE_ grace about him , the kind that kids don't have , but that I had sometimes admired in other older men
was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp
_RARE_ thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too
hardly believe such good luck was mine
Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him
she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie
like it one bit
could I do
had to have his release -- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school -- and I wasn't providing it for Johnnie
his wife
have , even if he'd asked her
wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will
wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that
too _RARE_ to leave his wife _RARE_ and leave those helpless children without their _RARE_
me and wanted me
only love I was giving him was the pure kind
weeks before we even kissed for the first time
_RARE_ wishes , we'd been seeing each other for short _RARE_ in the truck
were _RARE_ enough -- mostly we talked
the time the first _RARE_ of spring came around , we both knew we were _RARE_ in love
then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little
so crazy '' , I told him once
always imagined I would probably end up _RARE_ a minister or somebody like that
no _RARE_
''
you fall for a lumber _RARE_ ''
drinks far too much ''
_RARE_ too much ''
'' , I was _RARE_ off the items on my fingers , `` _RARE_ too much and goes out with the boys , _RARE_ they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the _RARE_ ''
his _RARE_ carefully
could walk out the door ''
you dare ''
never show my face or my truck around here again ''
wasn't looking at me
wouldn't ''
I could visit Lucille Warren ''
wouldn't

''
_RARE_
might ''
he was seeing her
admitted it to me
_RARE_ beside him in the truck
all my doing -- his seeing her
I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it
, Johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me
he had said , `` All right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be ''
had I done , trying to keep us pure
driven him into the arms of that _RARE_ woman
just the same as delivered him into the hands of the _RARE_
week later , I _RARE_ to him in the little motel on _RARE_ 10
first time
desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the _RARE_ of Lucille Warren
though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever _RARE_
him , with a _RARE_ _RARE_
, it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me
me , Johnnie ''
will , _RARE_ ''
in the _RARE_ fields behind the motel , a thousand _RARE_ _RARE_ us
you always love me this way ''
_RARE_

''
_RARE_ closer to the man I loved
as _RARE_ and _RARE_ a night as any bride ever experienced
had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no _RARE_ of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them

can't be wrong , can it
''
on one elbow
_RARE_
wrong if love is real ''
great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness
, complete _RARE_
, I later discovered
no conflict between what I was doing and my _RARE_ religious _RARE_
always _RARE_ the passes made at me by other kids , and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about
also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married
practically a bride , after all
have been a ceremony if it had been possible
, I had no doubt
do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness
he would
only told me so , he'd proved it
_RARE_ fault that he was _RARE_ tied down to that _RARE_ woman who did her best to make his life unbearable
he was _RARE_ enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too
I could contribute to that , I'd do it
didn't matter
is too high when true love is at stake
had no _RARE_ about how true this love was
even _RARE_ with a boy , and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the _RARE_ while , not until I all but threw myself at him
plenty _RARE_ , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half
a mere twelve years matter
, I was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity
I _RARE_ him from Lucille Warren
gotten him , if I hadn't stopped her
, Lucille Warren was a _RARE_ from way back
been a good girl and now God was _RARE_ me with the gift of this magnificent man and the _RARE_ love we shared
only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring
me ''

''
and always , Johnnie ''

in Boston
wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow
entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming , members of the Young _RARE_ _RARE_ , and I'd been chosen to represent our chapter
mixed emotions about going
seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but I still didn't want to leave him for five whole days
had looked forward so much to being with this church group
been doing as much work as I used to in _RARE_ and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever
to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group
went to Boston
meeting was held in _RARE_ Hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states
Alma , at whose home I was _RARE_ during the _RARE_ , introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island
them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named _RARE_ , a boy about my age with slick , blond hair and dancing blue eyes
very different from Johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me
so , and he mentioned it , and Alma said so too
meeting , there was going to be a party at _RARE_ house
Alma would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated
hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow
, there , beautiful _RARE_ of mine '' , _RARE_ said
a _RARE_ to get to the party ''
help laughing with him
, I should find Alma '' -- I began
, _RARE_
with me ''

time we arrived , the party was already going strong
of the girls were laughing rather _RARE_ and I realized they were drinking
wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie
liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning
Johnnie _RARE_ the taste with _RARE_ _RARE_ , I enjoyed it
I enjoyed _RARE_ anything if I did it with Johnnie
suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening
was only natural , I decided ; ; surely he was still resting _RARE_ in my heart
don't see Alma anywhere '' , I said
_RARE_ tonight
let's find out where they're keeping the glasses ''
back
-- I don't think so , _RARE_
me ''
, come on ''
-- really ''


least come along while I get _RARE_ ''
was _RARE_
, most of them , and I wasn't even sure all of them had come from the _RARE_ meeting
circumstances , he had a certain _RARE_ _RARE_ charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs
he looked like an _RARE_ who had left his _RARE_ _RARE_ on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach
he thought
of orange juice would make everything seem better
around his little _RARE_ : bureau , bed , table , chair , _RARE_ stove
remembered
share a refrigerator '' , Mrs. Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in _RARE_ rain , that had sounded reasonable
cold light of day , it seemed a _RARE_ arrangement
, maybe -- but share refrigerator
explained it -- something about summer _RARE_ eating out and not enough space in the units
was the thing
seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of _RARE_ _RARE_
yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` _RARE_ veranda '' between Unit _RARE_ Three and Unit _RARE_ Four
still _RARE_ , and Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ through the gray _RARE_ like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and _RARE_
his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green _RARE_ , his spirits as damp as the day
had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it
a full month '' , the doctor had said
of sun , lots of rest
_RARE_ are a _RARE_ compound
a sleeping _RARE_
will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked
men get to be my age , you won't take _RARE_ so lightly ''
accepted the diagnosis without comment
could call it anything from _RARE_ to _RARE_ ; ; but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it
loved and lost Vivian _RARE_ to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by _RARE_ the bride _RARE_ forever , which was really _RARE_ it on
caught , too , like an _RARE_ , a confirmed _RARE_ of women
-- _RARE_ , really , because Vivian had given him every _RARE_ -- forever shy
on , his was going to be a man's world : the North _RARE_ , duck _RARE_ at _RARE_ , beer and _RARE_ and male _RARE_
he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make _RARE_ _RARE_ at his feet , the doctor's _RARE_ for lots of sun seemed like a hollow _RARE_
damp circumstances , he was an _RARE_ bet to develop _RARE_
up to see Mrs. Kirby , _RARE_ in a _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , bearing down on him
blow ''
triumphantly
noticed before that the _RARE_ seemed to regard really _RARE_ weather as a kind of _RARE_ victory over the tourists
, day after tomorrow '' , she added
hope so '' , he said
got this cold
_RARE_ it out in the sun ''
''
him briefly
got a peaked look
in out of the wet ''
to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , _RARE_ being less than _RARE_
its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever
imagine her at this minute , _RARE_ in _RARE_ with _RARE_ , _RARE_ on golden _RARE_ , looking forward to a life of _RARE_ _RARE_
could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a _RARE_ sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long
through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests : four separate _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ ( At the _RARE_ , At the _RARE_ , On the _RARE_ , and In _RARE_ ) and several agricultural _RARE_ on the treatment of _RARE_ disease in cattle , _RARE_ illustrated
, only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , _RARE_ his other _RARE_
a yellow pill , only to _RARE_ on it , and went for the _RARE_ , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and _RARE_
thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her _RARE_ for color , had _RARE_ a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the _RARE_ variety that _RARE_ onto men's _RARE_ -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size _RARE_
about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the _RARE_ , bread , and a Bermuda _RARE_ , and put the whole thing out of his mind
, he found a note in the refrigerator
you mind _RARE_ your _RARE_ ''
note
smell _RARE_ everything ''
the sweater , a _RARE_ case , and a _RARE_ bottle of _RARE_ _RARE_ pink hand lotion
paper was pink , too , and the _RARE_ small and _RARE_ and utterly _RARE_
he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach _RARE_
`` _RARE_ '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` Don't you eat ''
want to encourage anything here ; ; but on the other hand , he didn't want her _RARE_ his _RARE_
_RARE_ '' , came the answer the following day
''
really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered _RARE_ just why she kept the sweater _RARE_
, as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense

take Vivian

if this were Vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink
be black or white or _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , like Vivian herself
Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and _RARE_ girls who wore pink were _RARE_ _RARE_ to their _RARE_
does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator ''
aloud

Mrs. Kirby , making her _RARE_ way along the veranda , _RARE_ with a _RARE_ collection of _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
that you say ''
, nothing
the _RARE_ stopped ''
, yes
at that sky
_RARE_ by afternoon ''
hope so
this cold ''
you said ''
him
, you're peaked
to watch out that you don't get burned to an _RARE_ , first _RARE_ day
remember to _RARE_ the girl next to you in _RARE_
_RARE_ the worst ''
kind , Charlie thought
_RARE_ description
, neither was peaked
hear Mrs. Kirby now , warning her pale guest against _RARE_
spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say
that peaked kind ''
was a better word
in the mirror
_RARE_
more closely
_RARE_ -- peaked
two damp days with the _RARE_ _RARE_ had done him no good
, _RARE_ hot as _RARE_ , was far from kind to Mrs. _RARE_ _RARE_ properties
came up from the beach for his _RARE_ pill , the whole establishment ( _RARE_ enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a _RARE_ modern painting -- great blocks of _RARE_ color , _RARE_ at regular intervals by the _RARE_ white of five community _RARE_
, he thought , he would look around for some more _RARE_ _RARE_ , with _RARE_ _RARE_ , maybe , at the door
not imagine a _RARE_ being brave enough to grow beside _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and the rest
was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes
she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes
a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his _RARE_ to her side of the refrigerator and _RARE_ `` Be my guest '' on the _RARE_
him a good feeling

, was her answer the next day
was _RARE_ against his pill bottles and bore a _RARE_ : `` You're not at all well , are you ''
got this cold '' , he wrote
it was any of her business
none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my Aunt _RARE_ used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be _RARE_
, she's still living , and she's _RARE_
you try that ''
don't have a lemon ''
to write very small to get it on the bottom of the _RARE_ of paper
next morning , she had turned the paper over
, neither do I ''

sound like a pale girl
a little like a _RARE_
, _RARE_ are often pale
his head in Mrs. _RARE_ little _RARE_ office
guess that _RARE_ next to me took your advice
seen her on the beach ''
won't , if you're looking for a _RARE_
_RARE_ hair ''
that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , _RARE_ girl in a pink bathing suit
pink bathing suits on _RARE_ , and _RARE_ girls in red or black or green bathing suits
a _RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ and a _RARE_ of _RARE_ tank suits
a _RARE_ , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an _RARE_ and absorbed in her painting
little attention to her because she was a _RARE_ and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , _RARE_ _RARE_
beach , there were pale girls and _RARE_ girls
saw them all as he walked up and down
that morning , he was still walking -- up and down _RARE_ , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , _RARE_ beach
in _RARE_ , he opened the refrigerator , _RARE_ her hand lotion , and left a note
got this _RARE_ '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion
don't mind ''
course I don't mind '' , she answered
having a miserable time , aren't you
the lotion you want , and for _RARE_ sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days ''
a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided
a fine quality in a woman
, for instance , was not too long on sympathy
, and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ; it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own
know what was so tough about _RARE_ world , _RARE_ around _RARE_ with _RARE_
got a _RARE_
see Vivian offering any hand lotion
_RARE_ him , once the worst of the agony was over
the next two days in his _RARE_ bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to _RARE_ , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion
back and forth
your _RARE_ now
thing , this lotion has _RARE_ in it , and that _RARE_ the skin , so if you're so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it ''
not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair ''
Mrs. Kirby
she told you I was _RARE_ , too
cold ''
out
say you were _RARE_

''
goes with pale and peaked

two things here about _RARE_ in the _RARE_ , and a book called ' Tom _RARE_ and His _RARE_ _RARE_ ' ; ; but the picture of Tom _RARE_ is pretty sinister
_RARE_ ''
a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot
Riverside pitcher turned out to have an _RARE_ fast ball that took a _RARE_
few _RARE_ the Anniston team couldn't figure him out
in the fifth , _RARE_ kid catcher caught onto a curve and _RARE_ the ball into left center field
, _RARE_ _RARE_ playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him
cut over to center from left field to get the _RARE_
up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil

''

around and made an accurate throw into Mike _RARE_ hands on third base
the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag
Anniston boy had begun his slide too late
into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face
bastard ''
catcher screamed
to his feet and started to throw _RARE_
tossed his _RARE_ away and began to swing at the catcher
in everybody from both sides , while the _RARE_ stood up and added to the _RARE_
were separated in a few minutes
was resumed
Deegan was boiling mad now
_RARE_ was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout
, coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink
was standing beside it , facing the field
_RARE_ the Anniston catcher _RARE_ up his pitcher before the _RARE_ began
your eyes open , _RARE_ ''
to the catcher
in for trouble ''
catcher did not reply with words
turned to Mike and smiled
_RARE_ Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard
me God , I'll get him ''
said : `` Why don't you leave him alone ''
your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said

into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble
answer was in his eyes
smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips
last of the sixth _RARE_ Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left _RARE_ head
time the _RARE_ got his hands on the ball Deegan was _RARE_ third base and heading for home
_RARE_ threw and it was a good one
had no chance of being _RARE_
catcher was _RARE_ home plate
had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he _RARE_ into the catcher
heavily to the ground
got to his feet
back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back
players and their manager ran out on the field
water over their _RARE_ face
not move
manager called for a doctor
_RARE_ came down to look over the injured _RARE_
quickly , and a little _RARE_ , the doctor ordered a couple of _RARE_ to carry the catcher into the dressing room
was sitting on the bench , watching
_RARE_ started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the _RARE_ ''
, seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench
manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout
followed by four of his men
to look as if something was going to happen
quietly watching the manager come nearer
moved over to Mike _RARE_ side
said a word
manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike
was flushed
'' , the manager said , his voice _RARE_ low , quivering
was a _RARE_ thing to do ''
God's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away
it , will you
guys not to block the plate ''
didn't have to _RARE_ him ''
what you say ''
manager looked at Eddie Lee
a cold and calculated look
and went back across the field to his dugout
in the pitcher who had been _RARE_ , and a big , heavy , _RARE_ built right _RARE_ moved out to the _RARE_ for Anniston
started again and in the eighth _RARE_ Mike Deegan came up to bat
the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting
ball the _RARE_ pitcher threw came in for Mike's head
into the dirt , the ball going over him
slowly and brushed himself off
back into the _RARE_ box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again
the _RARE_ ''
from the Anniston bench
Riverside dugout Frankie _RARE_ , _RARE_ , whispered into _RARE_ ear : `` There's gonna be a fight ''
at those bastards ''
, a pitcher , said
looking for trouble ''
slow getting into the box this time
finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in
''
to the pitcher
more and I'm coming out there ''
be waiting ''
yelled back
_RARE_ the rubber plate with the end of his bat
_RARE_ in the box , but not very close to the plate now
wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head
, got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the _RARE_
tossed his _RARE_ away and came towards Mike Deegan
both walking towards each other , _RARE_
Anniston players rushed out on the field
next moment , it seemed , the _RARE_ was crowded with _RARE_ , _RARE_ , cops , kids and a dog
much shouting and screaming
up and were quickly _RARE_
the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together
and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started
game , Phil was taking off his _RARE_ in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in
a _RARE_ thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a _RARE_ own _RARE_ won't come out and help him in a fight ''
and pulled the wet _RARE_ over his head
sat down on the bench near Phil
players were _RARE_ quietly
had not come in yet
over to Phil and stood over him
the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me ''
didn't think it was necessary ''

just fine
think it was necessary ''
both his hands on his hips
his jaw forward
, wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy ''
a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face
didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly
else did , either ''
trying to say I started the fight ''
not trying to say anything ''
away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff ''
_RARE_ his locker door shut and spun around
anything could happen Frankie _RARE_ was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room
, come into my office '' , Eddie said
Eddie into the office and shut the door
down before _RARE_ desk
doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly
get your _RARE_ release as of today ''
_RARE_ just a trifle
best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home
belong in professional baseball ''
to clear his throat
this because of what happened out there ''
'' , Eddie said
it does confirm what I've suspected all along ''
up

the second time
_RARE_ down , sit down '' , Eddie said
not saying you're yellow
saying you're not a professional _RARE_ ''
leaned forward over the desk
listen to me , Phil
steering you wrong
got the heart for baseball ''
his head and Eddie _RARE_
voice grew hard
the hell do you think baseball is
in the big _RARE_ , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there ''
to say something but Eddie cut him short
don't tell me what a good ball player you are
you've got talent
you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with
, Phil
haven't got the heart for _RARE_ , and that's it ''
Phil said : `` I don't get it
average '' Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly
difference does your _RARE_ average make
_RARE_ average
the way you run bases
you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it
I mean by no heart for the game
_RARE_
no business _RARE_ into that kid out there
it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on
hell do you think baseball is

way of life , _RARE_
got to be ready to cut to _RARE_ anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you ''


his opinion
other _RARE_ in this _RARE_
up slowly
a little pale and _RARE_
felt glued together
think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally


your pay in the morning ''
and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` _RARE_ you'll see I was right ''
the door behind him
the dressing room , Frankie _RARE_ sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes
happened ''

: `` I got my release ''
crazy ''

for ''

his head
don't get it ''
don't know '' , Phil said
silent for a few moments
said : `` What are you gonna do ''
to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again
off one shoe and stared at it
take it like this '' , Frankie said
, plenty of guys get let out and come back later
are full of guys like that ''
very quiet
are you gonna do , Phil ''
not answer
not try another club ''
up
hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that

to _RARE_ Jackson ''
didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that

_RARE_ for a job ''

'' , he said
come in tomorrow ''

speak to _RARE_ ''
boy ''
talk to him , all right ''
worry '' , Frankie said
get a job there
_RARE_ bad ''
not worried about it '' , Phil said
the way to talk
did Eddie have to say ''
'' , Phil said
interest seemed the product of his _RARE_
reading took him into certain _RARE_ of religion and the subject of religion began to _RARE_ him
was twelve he took to reading St. _RARE_ and _RARE_ , then _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ by endless _RARE_ and numerous _RARE_ papers
birthday , because Richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the _RARE_ and a little image of the Indian god , _RARE_
day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The _RARE_ of the Dead , which she suspected Richard would enjoy
_RARE_ happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read
one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god ''
you think there were two ''
father
don't understand '' , Richard said _RARE_
laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard ''
spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again
in the formal study of religion _RARE_ when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in _RARE_ affairs
still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he _RARE_ from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in _RARE_ studies
a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his _RARE_ , a thorough if _RARE_ knowledge of _RARE_ _RARE_ , literature , life , politics and history
_RARE_ a _RARE_ to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been _RARE_ and his image of _RARE_ , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country
at home was not comfortable
, who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his _RARE_ off by himself for an _RARE_ which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be _RARE_
to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested
you still have The _RARE_ of the Dead ''
him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it ''
'' , he _RARE_ to _RARE_ the conversation , `` I still have it ''
no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject
The _RARE_ of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been _RARE_ in a _RARE_ in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York
_RARE_ each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big _RARE_ , given them up to the flames
sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried
America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of _RARE_ and , on the _RARE_ which took him to Japan , he _RARE_ at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he _RARE_ _RARE_ an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard
second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure
from his cabin late that night and crept out into a _RARE_ North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water
so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the _RARE_ rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it
as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind
Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend
student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident _RARE_ to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her
nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching _RARE_ of Tokyo
, Richard saw a _RARE_ and a _RARE_ for doing things which , after a fashion , he _RARE_
, he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity
him that he ought to be a member of some of the small _RARE_ parties she held at her rooms and in the end he _RARE_ with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random _RARE_
such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at Ryusenji today
ever been to Ryusenji ''
had
, it's at _RARE_ and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool
thoroughly startled ''
it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but _RARE_ manner during the _RARE_ was more _RARE_ and _RARE_ than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the _RARE_ words which had preceded it
the four persons present , all foreign students in Tokyo , had been playing a game of _RARE_ popular Japanese foods by the In and Out system , an equation in which _RARE_ philosophy was used as the _RARE_
_RARE_ and tea were In because they could be taken _RARE_
Out because it was _RARE_
In , Samuel Burns had suggested , because it was too far Out to stay Out , even if it was a little _RARE_
kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the _RARE_ nearly painful to his ears
wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte
you watch him ''
_RARE_ girl named _RARE_ _RARE_
shouldn't have been able to do that ''
I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of _RARE_
a minute , anyhow
no one has been there
there a number of times
I thought you knew everything about Tokyo
been to Ryusenji ''
heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said
a little place there called _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ and _RARE_ ''
, a little _RARE_ place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` _RARE_ , it's all very nice
man who brought sweet _RARE_ into _RARE_ is _RARE_ there , next to a beautiful seated _RARE_ of Fudo
that's what I meant to tell you
the interesting part , Richard '' , she had a _RARE_ habit of trying to pull him into the talking
was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' -- `` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns
or twenty-three ''
the water would be still _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ seemed to _RARE_ at the thought of it
your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath
kill one of us ''
the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire ''
eyes came up and seemed for the _RARE_ moment to reflect sharp light
true ; ; Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese _RARE_ of _RARE_
went on but Richard stopped listening
himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall
almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy _RARE_ of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching
sensed some connection between the incident on the _RARE_ and the _RARE_ at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together
, after leaving _RARE_ apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room
at last did go to his room , he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of _RARE_ , thinking first of _RARE_ tale of the man at Ryusenji , then of his biwa and the _RARE_ Pacific waters
next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to _RARE_ and walked to Ryusenji
surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned
through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and _RARE_ at the two thin falls which dropped from large _RARE_ high at the back of the pool
_RARE_ above was _RARE_ what might have been an _RARE_ of Fudo , or perhaps a _RARE_
creature , _RARE_ in wire , made him _RARE_
he so _RARE_ realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be _RARE_ to the _RARE_ green water or the little _RARE_ or the green _RARE_ _RARE_ beyond his reach
the pool and climbed the _RARE_ stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him
little well before the temple he dropped a _RARE_ coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of _RARE_ ; ; but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple _RARE_
he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head
Fudo seemed to stare _RARE_ back at him and _RARE_ eyes were caught by the _RARE_ in _RARE_ , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of _RARE_ face and there was a terrible metallic _RARE_ sound , as if the large _RARE_ were about to burst from some pressure within it
flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently
_RARE_ his pockets of all his _RARE_ and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both _RARE_ and away from the temple , never looking back
all the miles back to his room
to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot
home , reading and _RARE_ to think about his _RARE_ experience at Ryusenji
process of _RARE_ to think about it was an active _RARE_ in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day
_RARE_ , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the _RARE_ sight of burning metal , the _RARE_ sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life
the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he _RARE_ never again to visit the temple at _RARE_
thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was _RARE_ the _RARE_ field far across the hill from the farm buildings
grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of _RARE_ ground , carrying the _RARE_ of cool water
usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old _RARE_ _RARE_ or a stick along , to play with
that the _RARE_ was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make _RARE_ , tractor sounds with his lips
ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time
turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the _RARE_ , the snake was there
half in the _RARE_ and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the _RARE_
was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly
slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the _RARE_ and did not go any further
never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful
_RARE_ and _RARE_ and he lay in the _RARE_ and moved his _RARE_ and _RARE_ head only so slightly
of the _RARE_ , snake , I said , but it did not move at all
the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only _RARE_ its black , _RARE_ tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without _RARE_ or concern
the engine _RARE_ then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it
did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed _RARE_ a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly
it , looking at the brilliant colors on its _RARE_ back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown _RARE_ the size of a baby's fist down its back , and the _RARE_ were set one within the other and _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_
were _RARE_ , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that _RARE_ flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm
were clear and black and the slender body was _RARE_ slightly
and gracefully _RARE_ head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth
, I said , I couldn't kill you
much too beautiful
killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was _RARE_ that an animal such as that should die
him up , and the length of him _RARE_ very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the _RARE_ of that _RARE_ , _RARE_ body , like _RARE_ ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of him , like _RARE_ swallowed whole might make
_RARE_ through my hands like cool _RARE_ , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the _RARE_ of that body
him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , _RARE_ earth , from between my pale hands
worked away very slowly and _RARE_ and with a _RARE_ kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled _RARE_
, burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target
good and satisfied , looking at the snake
in its bright _RARE_ color against the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the _RARE_ black _RARE_ of soil and against the _RARE_ of myself
and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and _RARE_ field
on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long _RARE_ and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks
my back to the corner of the _RARE_ field that pointed towards the house
was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the _RARE_ because they were not _RARE_ properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was _RARE_ across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake
it all at a glance
was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the _RARE_ earth , _RARE_ with _RARE_ and a kind of _RARE_ impatience
that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , I could tell the _RARE_ mark of _RARE_ on the boy
see the _RARE_ shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the _RARE_ of his arms as he _RARE_ at it with the stick
, I shouted , but the _RARE_ and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say
the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even _RARE_ in that _RARE_ , _RARE_ dance
no use
myself tremble , thinking of the _RARE_ light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and _RARE_ , if I could , that _RARE_ _RARE_ , catch the boy in the moment of his _RARE_ , and save a _RARE_ , a _RARE_ , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late
the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on
began to _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon _RARE_ , or they _RARE_
the anger _RARE_ within me
waited at the corner , with the _RARE_ of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown _RARE_ in the heat of the morning
the boy well
eleven and we had done many things together
a beautiful boy , really , with _RARE_ blonde hair and a smooth and still _RARE_ face , and his _RARE_ were long and dark and _RARE_ , and his eyes were blue
there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day
my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and _RARE_ , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well
then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the _RARE_ soil , through something there where I had been not long before
the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me
I ride around with you ''
, as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me
closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ; the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his
, you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water _RARE_ he offered to me
to the _RARE_ , upright stake
you do that ''

'' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement
killed a snake ; ; it was a big one ''
to take my hand to show me
did you kill it ''
are ugly and bad ''
snake was very beautiful
see how beautiful it was ''
are ugly '' , he said again
saw the colors of it , didn't you
ever seen anything like it around here ''
are ugly and bad , and it might have _RARE_ somebody , and they would have died ''
know there are no _RARE_ snakes in this area
could not harm anything ''
eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said
are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes ''
are talking _RARE_ '' , I said
killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason ''
ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted
_RARE_ snakes ''
was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself
skipped along beside me , and he was _RARE_ with what he had done
of the colors was gone ; ; there was a _RARE_ _RARE_ now ; ; the colors of its back were dull and _RARE_ , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes
head , so delicate and so cool , had been _RARE_ as if in a _RARE_ , and the _RARE_ tongue _RARE_ out of the twisted , torn mouth
was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life
the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the _RARE_ part of its body , between the colored _RARE_ crystals
it and the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny _RARE_ of the dead muscles , and I hoped that it was truly dead , so that I would not have to kill it
it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there
stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing _RARE_ in circles , making the _RARE_ tractor sound with his lips
, I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful
the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the _RARE_ from the _RARE_ and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live
came around behind me , dragging the stake
a big snake , isn't it ''

going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed ''
you see what you have done ''

you see the difference now ''
an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said
up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes
see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the _RARE_ _RARE_
'' , I said
have slapped the boy
up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side
, you little _RARE_ , you _RARE_ , _RARE_ , little _RARE_ , with _RARE_ already developed within that brain and in those eyes
to _RARE_ his face , to wipe forever the _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do
come _RARE_ easily , but this had not been a day of glad _RARE_
, production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own _RARE_ _RARE_ , a real _RARE_
he had enrolled his son four years ago
the boy's _RARE_ were in order -- _RARE_ _RARE_ , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards
to the many applicants on file , would he _RARE_ and write a personal letter giving them his _RARE_ motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership
lit his pipe with no comfort
it
the letter which would or would not _RARE_ his son , David , in Hanford
who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life
who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , _RARE_ or chief
if he had played it wrong
should have kept in touch
for _RARE_
had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford , Class of _RARE_
Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the _RARE_
help anyway
Pete _RARE_ , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years
was rejected
, Little _RARE_ _RARE_ , had no room for _RARE_ players with low grades
at his own _RARE_ _RARE_ record with pride
B average with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ in _RARE_ and science
son being that good in science
could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray _RARE_ as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford
, he hadn't studied very hard
president of the student body took a lot of time and _RARE_
down his pipe and started to type
response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership ''
and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a _RARE_ for Hanford College
have to be told his son looked like him
the same gray eyes , high _RARE_ , dark hair and a certain _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_
_RARE_
excellent
back to the typewriter with a little more confidence
interests range from _RARE_ and _RARE_ to electronics , tennis and swimming
motivation for _RARE_ at Hanford is the desire to '' -- Mr. Partlow _RARE_ his fist on the _RARE_ , _RARE_ the letter
to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build
you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do
have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor
you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself
him time , give him a chance
the _RARE_ blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he _RARE_ on a salesman who needed to have the _RARE_ taken off his thick head
production to make of a letter _RARE_ your own son
went up in _RARE_ at his _RARE_ panic
Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics
Hanford his son had _RARE_ in numerous _RARE_ activities
to a social club , a civic group , little _RARE_ , swimming team , and had been president of the student _RARE_ as well as treasurer of the science club
with a _RARE_ of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter
that did it
met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to _RARE_
the _RARE_ letter into his coat pocket
it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything
, his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products
a way with words
it was natural , half was Smith College
whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college
had it or she didn't
it
what she meant and let it be
got on his back
take the advice or leave it
as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator
look like you just heard a real _RARE_ , Mr. Partlow ''
at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years
was just thinking how things have changed
went to college they begged you to come
guest
pleasure
have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and _RARE_ with knowledge ''
open the door to the lobby
a fact , Mr. Partlow
applied to six colleges before he got in ''
to State ''

of the _RARE_ club here , you know
around with science stuff
along those lines , you might say
a science scholarship to _RARE_ ''
'' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom
''
drove home through the _RARE_ traffic , Cady felt the _RARE_ growing
told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David
all turned down his son
leadership



motivation

realized when he walked into his own pretty _RARE_ expensive house that he needed the _RARE_ Anne had waiting for him
his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of _RARE_ and tossed _RARE_ gave no _RARE_ from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket
looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did
looking at Anne
did
her blond hair and the _RARE_ of _RARE_ across her nose
_RARE_ eyes she saw things as clearly and _RARE_ as David did
could sense the _RARE_ end of a _RARE_ day
meeting tonight , Cady ''
, I begged off
do ''
I have the car , Dad ''
not let him take it , Cady
it is _RARE_ , but it's only eight days before _RARE_
the rules ''
deep in thought , neither heard nor answered

put down his _RARE_ knife and said loudly , `` Mr. _RARE_ ''
head came up like that of the _RARE_ fire horse
sorry , Dave

you can have it ''
two pieces of _RARE_ as he did everything else , slowly , _RARE_ and with interest
anything from Hanford yet , Dad ''
the question
worry about it , Dave
will come through ''
on his sports coat and picked up the car keys
be too sure , Dad
got turned down by _RARE_ and he is a _RARE_ student ''
it wasn't surprising because Charles was _RARE_ , a _RARE_ _RARE_ , and completely _RARE_
can hardly say the same about you , Dave ''
her lightly

old man to bed early
a little bit _RARE_ ''
until the door had slammed and picked up the _RARE_
go into the library
seem somewhat _RARE_ ''
her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable _RARE_ room
didn't know I looked so _RARE_ ''
word , darling
has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it
help ''
a way , yes
hasn't decided on _RARE_ application yet
a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership
I wrote ''
her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was _RARE_
could feel _RARE_ questioning eyes
know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student _RARE_ for a few days
when half the school was down with _RARE_ ''
he was president ''
he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club
took over the week Bill _RARE_ was in the state _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
his jaw out
fact remains he was treasurer ''
the swimming team
Cady , he made second team
the first ''
team is a team '' , insisted Cady
else ''
'' , she said quietly
don't think you've been quite honest , Cady
like you


mad about stars at the age of nine
You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the _RARE_ six years ago
his interests now ''
do you suggest ''
say he _RARE_ swimming , tennis , _RARE_ and music ''

been to a _RARE_ _RARE_ all season ''

he plays _RARE_ with Chief _RARE_ _RARE_ and his Five _RARE_ ''
mean that _RARE_ _RARE_
that he never _RARE_ like Jack on _RARE_ or _RARE_ on _RARE_
he's just there , that's all ''
, he's just there
the beat going
to play _RARE_ because he doesn't have to _RARE_
like to rise and _RARE_
, Cady , he'll be back in the _RARE_ _RARE_ by next year ''
slightly _RARE_
right
refuse to be _RARE_ honest and mention Chief _RARE_ _RARE_ and his Five _RARE_ ''
and Cady felt the tension _RARE_ its grip on the back of his neck
I am _RARE_ it a bit , Anne '' , he said
you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college
to have leadership as well as grades ''
the _RARE_ _RARE_
you know he is advertising his _RARE_ equipment for sale this weekend
used it now for several years
really say his motivation for college is electronics ''
the _RARE_ as though he had stepped off the curb on his _RARE_
what would you say he wants to do
''
Dave who is applying to Hanford College
you ask him ''
Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back
have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession
be guilty of trying to run his life ''
up the _RARE_ she was _RARE_ for the hospital _RARE_
because your father tried to make a _RARE_ out of you , you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off
you've wanted him to _RARE_ to your mold
him to be a leader of men , like you ''
the _RARE_ chip back on his shoulder
has qualities of leadership
hasn't developed them yet
time ''
will , Cady
kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people
_RARE_ thinking won't change that
you used to say in the Army
run a war with _RARE_ _RARE_ and one private ''
the block to the _RARE_ , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne
it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all
begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions
of white cotton shorts ruled his life
at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind
rose in the morning , the image was still there
always been a _RARE_ and _RARE_ man
_RARE_ days , his bedroom had been _RARE_ with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order
Dolores _RARE_ following in their footsteps
was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of _RARE_ he left _RARE_ across the rug
an _RARE_ _RARE_ in his grinning refusal to pick them up
he enjoyed seeing her _RARE_ to lift the things
the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party
curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like _RARE_
was the color of those _RARE_ which in seed _RARE_ are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of _RARE_ or _RARE_ or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad _RARE_ of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of _RARE_ which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness
sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair
her back , pressed on the column of _RARE_ , which held her so _RARE_ straight and _RARE_ , until the _RARE_ of bone made tiny sharp cracking _RARE_ , like the snapped stem of a _RARE_
to put it _RARE_ , nothing snapped
had not seriously troubled him , not then

could take at _RARE_
thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put
later that they had made their marriage too quickly
too little occasion _RARE_ for resistance , the brave strong _RARE_ of emotional _RARE_ and meeting
left themselves too much to discover
at the start , his new life felt _RARE_

on the _RARE_ day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon
he dropped the shorts on the floor
, I'm not going to pick up those shorts ''
her a _RARE_ _RARE_
think you'll get tired of them there ''
morning the shorts were where he had left them
to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did
almost too easy
had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests
would not be on the floor when he came home that evening
wrong
of the bedroom had been _RARE_ to a _RARE_ _RARE_ , but in the middle of the carpet lay the _RARE_ shorts
the room a strange note of _RARE_ , like a _RARE_ on a beautiful face
that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous
determined to foil her
be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ; my nerves are as strong
to the bedroom when the _RARE_ _RARE_

early
standing a few feet from the front door
around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away
_RARE_ in the doorway
not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to _RARE_ the shorts
his back
to answer the bell
was deposited in the hall closet
most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led _RARE_ to the bedroom
his ears
he could not be sure
caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there
of _RARE_ slid over their voices
_RARE_ favored him with odd , _RARE_ looks
had been instructed `` not to say a word ''
reason , this _RARE_ in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other _RARE_
there was a void no one could fill
went home early
, later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night
as possible
was so taken _RARE_ , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in
contrary , it would only _RARE_ his position if he _RARE_ , while she stayed calm and _RARE_
he _RARE_ after _RARE_ at her

ran up the white flag altogether

the sober possibility
head was the _RARE_ of those _RARE_ with _RARE_
something about private _RARE_ _RARE_ which always made him feel _RARE_ and _RARE_
his mother _RARE_ with her neighborhood women friends , _RARE_ her voice to a _RARE_ _RARE_ which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening
even recall the last time he sat there
talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` _RARE_ Martin said he was sorry
so _RARE_ , I couldn't keep being annoyed with him ''
even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ; he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it
mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , _RARE_ ears
had to be fought
best sex win
resolution hardly seemed to help
situation had been bad , it now got worse
time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough
wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that _RARE_ months -- instead of deciding not to _RARE_ the date until he could get away
were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by
people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment
, the _RARE_ of inspection included the _RARE_ shorts
curious how the different visitors took this
to ignore the _RARE_ on the _RARE_ _RARE_

few laughed
all Dolores told a _RARE_ and _RARE_ tale
a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin _RARE_ , carrying the _RARE_ through a _RARE_ and _RARE_ course
waited in the living room
went along
the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing
of the guests showed his _RARE_
were in a hurry , weren't you ''
have liked to break the man's neck
; ; she let the interpretation stand
heard himself give a _RARE_ of mock good nature
eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It's a little contest -- Never again did he enter into the _RARE_ of showing the apartment
up a rigid _RARE_ of speaking relations
seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything
talk about
picking up any of his clothes ( except the _RARE_ shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in _RARE_ his possessions
into the habit of putting his clothes in _RARE_ and _RARE_ , so his life might _RARE_ as little as possible on hers
alone remained
moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying
of their amazement
He could hear the word
_RARE_ situation
up to visit them and He had thought her exactly what he wanted
of marriage and I'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously
idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now
know why ; ; he would cut a _RARE_ ridiculous figure
_RARE_
night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself
_RARE_ frantically , seeking an exit
had periods of _RARE_ _RARE_ in which he determined _RARE_ , _RARE_ , to live out his life in this fashion
change , nothing would ever change
solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so _RARE_ by its _RARE_ that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before
_RARE_ of excitement , he considered his plan
shorts , he would place something of hers
would have won an _RARE_ moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her _RARE_ , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same
that it would be a particular _RARE_ to Dolores to pick up her own _RARE_ which he had laid on the floor
he could go on _RARE_ the _RARE_ _RARE_ : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a _RARE_ , or maybe a _RARE_ , next to his shorts
later , Dolores would crack
other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which _RARE_ the apartment
that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next _RARE_ of her story
, he thought , would become less gay
used his _RARE_ shorts as the very image of his _RARE_ , his lack of control , his general male _RARE_ , while she remained cool , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , the charming teacher who _RARE_ an _RARE_ body
her _RARE_ linked with his on the floor would draw her _RARE_ into a struggle both bitter and absurd
the back of his mind was aware that the _RARE_ of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and _RARE_ were involved , because it was truly his
kept him from _RARE_ his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of _RARE_ _RARE_
morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of _RARE_ _RARE_ pants , and _RARE_ dropped them next to his shorts
down on the bed
surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared
delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two _RARE_
deliberately she reached down and touched the _RARE_ with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second
he thought , she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too
that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him
fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room
not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes _RARE_
together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , _RARE_ up and down from the table so that talk was impossible
Martin thought , _RARE_ save
for work in high spirits
relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks
that he no longer hated Dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a _RARE_ of an _RARE_ feeling
old _RARE_ '' , Cap said
know , I've got one of your cars at home
prominent _RARE_ , you ought to be interested in his _RARE_ support group
_RARE_ down your _RARE_ ''
was , William thought
any more
of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap
he start on such a ride to brief _RARE_
, through the _RARE_ agency of his _RARE_
draft and Doc _RARE_ and Cap were responsible for his first _RARE_ , but _RARE_ Freddy _RARE_ could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time
a job , having been _RARE_ from a rather dangerous career in real estate and _RARE_ financing by _RARE_ , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one
bought _RARE_ _RARE_ Products , a _RARE_ corporation of _RARE_ which had _RARE_ many _RARE_ and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position
, Freddy had his usual _RARE_ of bold ideas
_RARE_ , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; he generally heard _RARE_ suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own _RARE_ concerns
Willis was _RARE_ toward deeper _RARE_ by _RARE_ _RARE_ and a concern for his _RARE_
to aid Freddy with her father , _RARE_ , no doubt , by _RARE_ open _RARE_ for Freddy and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
must have been the eventual disposal of _RARE_ fortune ; ; she _RARE_ assumed that the more he was _RARE_ with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy _RARE_ upon his death
reasons , Willis and _RARE_ started expanding _RARE_
another electronics factory , a specialized _RARE_ company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- _RARE_ research _RARE_
were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam _RARE_ , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections
power , Freddy looked for additional _RARE_ to _RARE_
, _RARE_ toward _RARE_ government _RARE_ , attracted him
_RARE_ Company , a _RARE_ firm which _RARE_ _RARE_ vehicles and other _RARE_ equipment , had recently constructed an _RARE_ , modern plant in a burst of _RARE_ optimism
a _RARE_ management and _RARE_ stockholders , it was _RARE_ for _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ was to keep growing by stock _RARE_ and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences
_RARE_ , he was convinced that _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ would be ideal for conversion to _RARE_ _RARE_ , tanks , missiles or _RARE_ of some kind
point William came into the picture
much _RARE_ the account , he had been appointed advertising head of _RARE_
routine by having his own firm and a _RARE_ partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least _RARE_ by the chance of wider opportunities
, eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the _RARE_ of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to _RARE_ and Washington
end , he said : `` I'm not _RARE_ by the proposition , sir
a guy named Jack Hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with _RARE_ , and I took him with me to _RARE_
expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind
will cost a fortune
, I'm _RARE_ more or less with the defense _RARE_ situation through my contacts in the Air Force
Adam _RARE_ is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side
thrown everything up for _RARE_ , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here
of _RARE_ aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet _RARE_ have _RARE_ the _RARE_ trade -- one jet can take the place of three _RARE_ planes
the aircraft companies are going to _RARE_ into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough
a few facts and figures I've assembled
stay with what you have and wait till the dust _RARE_ ''
at the bound pages given him and shrugged
'' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know

deeply committed to our plans already
me he has people to handle the money raising , and _RARE_ _RARE_ , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of _RARE_ and _RARE_ are no problem
like to exhibit the deadly _RARE_ effect of an elderly man's caution ''
, I appreciate that
you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm _RARE_ ; ; I've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to _RARE_ me
don't take care , the sisters will be entering the _RARE_ on opposite sides , _RARE_ their _RARE_ ''
is a _RARE_ prospect , Bill ''

shouldn't _RARE_ commercial affairs with _RARE_ , but in this case I have no choice
think about it
grateful to you , so grateful I wish you were my principal _RARE_ instead of Freddy ''
_RARE_ surprise , Freddy , Adam and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; allied to them was _RARE_ , devoting much time to _RARE_ her father , and _RARE_ dismissed all thought of the project and William was _RARE_ to _RARE_ further
_RARE_ , stock transfers were arranged , and Freddy became president of the _RARE_ combination
Hamrick , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for _RARE_ and Clay
about _RARE_ till , _RARE_ , he and Hamrick were proved correct
dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the _RARE_
_RARE_ by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end
plant turned out to be a white _RARE_
held in _RARE_ fell sharply in value
a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and _RARE_ for a _RARE_ liquidation
Willis _RARE_ William
were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I'm in something of a _RARE_
doesn't appeal to me
to other _RARE_ , I'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment
see if you can help me ''
a long week end _RARE_ with Hamrick
experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of _RARE_ useless _RARE_ _RARE_ , exposure to exciting _RARE_ of _RARE_ that nobody would buy , and the _RARE_ recent failure of a respected but _RARE_ _RARE_ manufacturer called _RARE_ Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to _RARE_ it
_RARE_ reaction to _RARE_ going into the _RARE_ car market was _RARE_
the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a _RARE_ chain of _RARE_ was simply too difficult
caught fire
could buy _RARE_ _RARE_ and use their _RARE_ and _RARE_ and other equipment , if William could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money _RARE_ was not _RARE_
nearly a month to _RARE_ , _RARE_ statistics , and put their _RARE_ down in black and white
with him , William went to Mr. Willis
surprised and _RARE_ , but impressed by the engineer and the report
alternative is _RARE_ '' , he said , `` and , I'm _RARE_ in saying , a bit mad
I was younger and less _RARE_
I can't _RARE_ this myself
to call in the brain trust
willing to run the _RARE_
_RARE_ you a sympathetic audience ''
be in there swinging '' , William said , `` but in a way , sir , you've got to decide it yourself
the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage
follow anyone , it'll have to be you ''

should explain : there's more here for me than _RARE_ my little dream , there's you
take a fall , or publicly back away
that
you're Arthur Willis
hearts and flowers theme ''
rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly
you ''
meeting , attended by Freddy , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and the _RARE_ executive staff , with Mr. Willis _RARE_ , William and Hamrick did indeed run the _RARE_
and _RARE_ , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and _RARE_
, my God '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ said , `` a little child shall lead them

absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face
leading Dad down the garden path ''

put an end to this , Arthur ''
me out , please '' , William begged
an advertising _RARE_ , I admit , but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere
_RARE_ went broke in the _RARE_ market _RARE_ the Big Three
weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were _RARE_
to sell 'em on economy and simple merit
at an age for romance and _RARE_

those little European jobs are doing
the consumer with a product , not _RARE_ him with _RARE_ excess length and weight
it moonlight and the call of far places and a _RARE_ , at reasonable rates
a few minutes too soon , before the _RARE_ changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of _RARE_ the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , _RARE_

them somewhat , but the debate raged on
as the main obstacle
made it evident that he had contributed his maximum
will _RARE_ it , I'm telling you '' , Freddy said
know what I'm talking about in that department ''
plenty of risk money '' , _RARE_ _RARE_ added , `` but not for anything this _RARE_ ''
right '' , William said
try to swing the deal on that basis
can't raise the capital , we're through
been lost
against it anyhow
you give me a chance ''
fell
turned in _RARE_ direction
at William and slowly rubbed his hands together
feel I must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the _RARE_ later , if any , should fall on me -- I don't _RARE_ _RARE_ spread broadcast outside my family
giving you a chance , Bill , but _RARE_ myself of your generous offer of assistance
to you ''
the _RARE_ have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and _RARE_ at William and Freddy in turn
out on _RARE_ forehead , whether from relief or _RARE_ he could not tell
table , Hamrick _RARE_ him _RARE_ with an _RARE_ thumb and forefinger
showed pleasure
_RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ with _RARE_ glasses and an _RARE_ _RARE_ suit , Jack Hamrick _RARE_ William at the _RARE_ club
, boss '' , he said , and grinned
suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington _RARE_ ''
afraid not ''
among these that _RARE_ identified a photograph of Barco
seems that Barco , _RARE_ himself a _RARE_ man ( and why not , after seven marriages
had listed himself for _RARE_ _RARE_ roles at the _RARE_ of his fourth murder _RARE_ who had said : `` With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies ''
Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of _RARE_ Barco
way , they stopped at every gas station along the main _RARE_ to question the _RARE_
at _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ on _RARE_ Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the _RARE_ to San _RARE_
in that direction and , at San Juan _RARE_ _RARE_ came upon Barco sitting in the _RARE_ old Spanish _RARE_ _RARE_ , eating a hot _RARE_
moment , Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his _RARE_ which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search
, however , was missing , for by that time Barco had _RARE_ of it at a _RARE_ in _RARE_
placed Barco under arrest and , without _RARE_ him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning
was that Barco , _RARE_ for mere _RARE_ , now began to suspect that one or another of his _RARE_ had been _RARE_
return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand _RARE_ They're better off , I tell you I saved their _RARE_ ''
, _RARE_ on Barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the _RARE_ citizens of our community who are _RARE_ _RARE_ -- that he was a more or less _RARE_ `` nut ''
in his cell _RARE_ trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life
had failed because , when _RARE_ to cut his _RARE_ , this murderer of seven women had _RARE_ at the sight of blood
authorities -- _RARE_ no particular significance to the _RARE_ -- offered Barco whisky to _RARE_ him ; ; but the old fellow , a _RARE_ _RARE_ , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter
was that District Attorney Welch entered the case
of _RARE_ ambition , with one eye on the _RARE_ of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity
reported to Welch's office that a _RARE_ in the city jail had attempted suicide
to know why
knew
had a _RARE_ theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at
attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test
paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their _RARE_ by stating _RARE_ : `` Barco , we've got the goods on you
a lot better if you come clean ''
Barco was _RARE_ and _RARE_
Welch's _RARE_ pursuit of the subject , Barco finally `` broke '' and started _RARE_ to one murder after another
time Barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true
true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into _RARE_ all over America as the hero of a great murder trial
jail officials to Barco's cell
Welch's _RARE_ , the police captain _RARE_ Welch's _RARE_ in Barco's confession
clearly a `` nut ''
strength , _RARE_ , _RARE_ to commit murder
_RARE_ a murderer

for the first time since his arrest , a _RARE_ of spirit lit Barco's eyes
had been attacked
and rose to his feet
them
that so ''

, for ten years I've been _RARE_ women
lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven
next day the police captain , in _RARE_ , organized what he _RARE_ `` Welch's _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
it seemed incredible that anyone could go on _RARE_ murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in Hollywood
party consisted of the police captain , Welch , Barco , _RARE_ with _RARE_ , newspaper reporters , and _RARE_
his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a _RARE_ which remained his principal attitude from that time on
the _RARE_ of _RARE_ to the sand _RARE_ near _RARE_ _RARE_
cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two _RARE_ sand hills , and indicated a location
given to dig
found
worried
captain _RARE_
boys cracked _RARE_ and again Barco's pride was aroused
precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left
and _RARE_ , the _RARE_ again started _RARE_
on edge
was _RARE_ that it was a nice day for a _RARE_ when finally one of the _RARE_ struck an object
something here ''
_RARE_
and everyone gathered around
, _RARE_ about with his _RARE_ , now raised into view a package _RARE_ wrapped in one of the _RARE_ Hollywood _RARE_ _RARE_
was a mere _RARE_ of the _RARE_ remains , it was enough
wild with delight
grew as Barco's seven _RARE_ brought to light one reward after another
Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him
to his head , and his ambition increased
apparent that Welch was in _RARE_ with _RARE_ and would use his power as _RARE_ to drag every possible sensation into the case
_RARE_ which would provide more `` copy '' for _RARE_ pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch
that both these _RARE_ were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand
, the _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_ would provide _RARE_ with _RARE_ : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' `` Viola Lake an _RARE_ '' `` _RARE_ of Another _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the _RARE_ _RARE_ over the broken reputation of a helpless girl
Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be _RARE_
long before I sensed that there was something deeper than _RARE_ ambition back of his desire for _RARE_ destruction
bitter and _RARE_ toward her , personally _RARE_
fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had _RARE_ _RARE_ toward _RARE_ favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had _RARE_ a share of them and had then been _RARE_ by some _RARE_ _RARE_
not rest until I had _RARE_ the mystery down
here it is
over a year before , there had been a _RARE_ party in an apartment of a downtown hotel
been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone
late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ; the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor
Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all _RARE_ to her host
so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken _RARE_ was a small table on which she noted a _RARE_ of red _RARE_ ; ; while _RARE_ from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as _RARE_ would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch
sat there , a _RARE_ impulse _RARE_ her to remove the shoes and _RARE_ from the _RARE_ feet and , as a _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ between the toes
later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the _RARE_ _RARE_ on `` The _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ '' , in the _RARE_ room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the _RARE_ , was to _RARE_
his way to his _RARE_ bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and _RARE_ selected his hat from the many on the bed
_RARE_ neither the absence of his _RARE_ nor the presence of the _RARE_ , he made his way to the _RARE_ room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the _RARE_
on the _RARE_ among his audience may well be imagined
, aside from reflecting on Welch's political career , had all but _RARE_ his home life
rested until he discovered who the _RARE_ was , and when he did , he _RARE_ _RARE_ on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way
it was
innocent actions are human _RARE_ sometimes set in motion
first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to _RARE_ with Viola as I should have liked
first place , it was difficult for us to meet
be seen together , for the tongue of _RARE_ was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of _RARE_ finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent
_RARE_ Viola to our house , for Mother _RARE_ refused to receive her
_RARE_ had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had _RARE_ a reflected _RARE_ through it , which had opened the doors of Los _RARE_ Society to her
Mother was received by the _RARE_ of _RARE_ lines which are _RARE_ by the _RARE_ ( of beer _RARE_ ) , the _RARE_ ( of _RARE_ origin ) , and the _RARE_ ( whose _RARE_ _RARE_ a _RARE_ famous trade in _RARE_ )
being dragged into the _RARE_ of these _RARE_
insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone _RARE_ connected with the _RARE_ is ever received in their exclusive _RARE_
, it was not until the King of _RARE_ had visited at _RARE_ that Mary and _RARE_ were _RARE_ to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and _RARE_ from the _RARE_
went so far as to _RARE_ up for me _RARE_ opportunities with _RARE_ _RARE_ who had been _RARE_ abroad , and with those of the more _RARE_ Los Angeles area where a _RARE_ was a girl who had been to high school
long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` _RARE_ '' in order to spend a _RARE_ evening with Viola and her _RARE_ at her home
such a _RARE_ of _RARE_ had grown up during the trial , that every _RARE_ had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , _RARE_ , to my own mother
arrived at _RARE_ I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen
me , in checked apron , _RARE_ in hand , and explained it was the _RARE_ night out and that she herself was preparing dinner
and watched proceedings
to be _RARE_ chicken with dressing , _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ , new _RARE_ with a _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ _RARE_ , and _RARE_ _RARE_ -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself
that _RARE_ was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater
that was accomplished was adding Mrs. _RARE_ tray to the _RARE_ pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an _RARE_ scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion
saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly
household hint : if you can't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone
if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their _RARE_ , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you _RARE_ within seconds after you pick up the phone
_RARE_ _RARE_ themselves around me , _RARE_ _RARE_
onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency
to get out a cool , poised , `` _RARE_ you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the _RARE_ , and with more warmth and less _RARE_ , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including _RARE_ Island and the _RARE_ reaches of _RARE_
to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed
the phone again and _RARE_ the _RARE_ , I resumed my everyday voice
were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like _RARE_ holding her breath and pretending to black out , _RARE_ _RARE_ the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and _RARE_
circumstances , I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to _RARE_ me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that Hank and I be there
that the girls had _RARE_ _RARE_ the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room
that I would be the _RARE_ if I accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats
get something done , I started in on the dishes

saying it right
meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink
so _RARE_ , however , so _RARE_ , that I found myself staring at them in _RARE_ and starting to _RARE_ again , this time about Francesca and her husband
them , I thought
_RARE_ were among the few people we knew in Catatonia
even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after I met _RARE_ at a _RARE_ meeting , and had taken us in hand socially
been kind to us and we were _RARE_ to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which _RARE_ , doctor , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ; the yellow pages of the telephone book were _RARE_ thin )
`` _RARE_ ''
an expert on narrow _RARE_ , thin _RARE_ , and _RARE_ , was men's fashion editor of _RARE_ , the weekly magazine with the tremendous _RARE_
he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from _RARE_ , or was it Wyoming
the daughter and sole _RARE_ of either a cattle _RARE_ or an oil _RARE_ and , having arrived in New York with a big bank roll , became a _RARE_ in various fields
_RARE_ Village artists for _RARE_ , then put some money into a Broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful )
during her `` writing '' period that she and _RARE_ met and decided that they were in love
married at a _RARE_ ceremony which was duly recorded in _RARE_ and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they _RARE_ in Bermuda
not Bermuda
not in style that year
_RARE_ in Rome ; ; everyone was very high on Rome that year
bought their house in Catatonia after _RARE_ all the regions of _RARE_ surrounding New York ; ; they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , _RARE_ , and _RARE_ of names
are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , _RARE_ had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just _RARE_ little _RARE_ and dull _RARE_ , but People Who Do _RARE_ ''
their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an _RARE_ at their way of always doing the right things
was a _RARE_ _RARE_ which they had had restored ( guided by an _RARE_ _RARE_ ) and _RARE_ , and added on to
a _RARE_ corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a _RARE_ room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud
all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the _RARE_ room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time
boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences
_RARE_ considered themselves violently _RARE_ and showed the world they were by filling their _RARE_ house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things )
her independence by _RARE_ against the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and _RARE_ _RARE_ by wearing Bermuda shorts and _RARE_ _RARE_ in colors ; ; bright _RARE_ and _RARE_ and vivid _RARE_
even wore the uniform in solid , _RARE_ black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the _RARE_
could dislike them , I thought
though , they did not seem quite human
, indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were _RARE_ who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles _RARE_ , with nice _RARE_
only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ; even brand names
hear the _RARE_ in _RARE_ voice when she said `` _RARE_ '' or `` _RARE_ '' or `` Madame Alexander ''
let it be known that there was wine in the pot _RARE_ or that the chicken had been _RARE_ in _RARE_ , and that _RARE_ second cousin was an intimate of theirs
have wasted time _RARE_ over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally _RARE_
feel at home among them
, there was Blanche
pleasant and charming , but Blanche was sweet
Blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being _RARE_ in warm , _RARE_ _RARE_
once been a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum _RARE_ , `` Oh , my _RARE_ has collapsed ''
how a real , _RARE_ woman would react to such a catastrophe
had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , _RARE_ things
me , no ; ; not Blanche
minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , who was a sort of _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ were _RARE_ committee _RARE_ and they usually managed to be elected _RARE_ , equal _RARE_ , of whatever _RARE_ or civic project was being launched
_RARE_ , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen _RARE_ for social leadership
mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , _RARE_ _RARE_
was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive
a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast
in an _RARE_ house whose _RARE_ , _RARE_ , paint , and even _RARE_ were chosen to complement her _RARE_ ; ; the _RARE_ were a couple of _RARE_ cats
was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , _RARE_ , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost _RARE_ , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick
of these women and others I had met in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were , to me at least , _RARE_
tell one from the other
, they were all in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising
two were writers of books ; ; all were fellows of finite charm
developed a _RARE_ _RARE_ and the habit of saying `` _RARE_ ''
to _RARE_
thought I'd live to hear people _RARE_ and say `` _RARE_ ''
life
have missed it for anything
`` sincere '' -- men of the _RARE_ _RARE_ and the urgent smile
acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they _RARE_ , _RARE_ with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting
_RARE_ love , for a total stranger , be _RARE_
always _RARE_ to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and I _RARE_ the whole lot of them to the same degree that I _RARE_ _RARE_ shops that called themselves `` _RARE_ Bake _RARE_ ''


thought , and wondered what kind of _RARE_ such odd _RARE_ would establish in this suburban _RARE_ ; ; _RARE_ who looked like _RARE_ _RARE_ even at _RARE_ conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister ''
, thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they _RARE_ less than _RARE_ _RARE_ ; ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` _RARE_ to _RARE_ '' ; ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; who were more _RARE_ than _RARE_ , more _RARE_ than persons
_RARE_ , they were people who read _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , and discussed _RARE_ ; ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` _RARE_ ''
raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about _RARE_ , which they were , because they had no opinions about _RARE_ , not having read _RARE_
, I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were
that it was nearly _RARE_ , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand
plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and _RARE_ dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen
I remembered that the girls had had a _RARE_ for _RARE_ every day for the last week
''
shouted each time
not _RARE_
even food
something you're supposed to put on _RARE_ for breakfast ''
around and found a _RARE_ , and was able to surprise them with a _RARE_ _RARE_ with _RARE_ _RARE_
I think you need only one rule for cooking : if you can't put _RARE_ in it , put _RARE_ in it
_RARE_ was received in a _RARE_ silence that was evidence in itself of the _RARE_ of taste _RARE_ Mama had been providing
closed her eyes , stretched forth her arms , and said : `` Take my hand , _RARE_ ; ; I'm a stranger in _RARE_ ''
say , I was _RARE_ at this _RARE_ _RARE_ upon free enterprise
they demand to `` _RARE_ '' in private financial records , _RARE_ , _RARE_ contracts and agreements
is as though '' , I said on the _RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ radio broadcast which I bought ( following Father Coughlin and _RARE_ the Eddie _RARE_ , Manhattan _RARE_ and Major _RARE_ shows ) `` That Man in the White House , like some _RARE_ of _RARE_ , insisted on reading my _RARE_ , _RARE_ my _RARE_ and _RARE_ my _RARE_
_RARE_ _RARE_ for civil rights created a _RARE_ of correspondence and one _RARE_ even asked me to consider _RARE_ the Eddie _RARE_ comedy hour on a permanent basis
quarter could a poor _RARE_ woman expect from a _RARE_ who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation
_RARE_ _RARE_ of red Russian _RARE_ descended on the _RARE_ that was mighty _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ with their _RARE_ battle cry of `` _RARE_ the rich '
_RARE_ _RARE_ , _RARE_ the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` _RARE_ '' the government a tax _RARE_ in excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained _RARE_ from such _RARE_ practices as paying taxes on the salary I had _RARE_ and the little I _RARE_ inherited as _RARE_ helpless _RARE_ , was `` _RARE_ '' with a personal bill of such _RARE_ proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , _RARE_ _RARE_
also publicly _RARE_ , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such _RARE_ publications as The New Republic , The New _RARE_ , Time and The Christian Science _RARE_
then that I _RARE_ myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax _RARE_
was _RARE_ and seemingly endless
like a _RARE_ but by the time I _RARE_ my case to the Supreme Court ( _RARE_ ) , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` _RARE_ '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest _RARE_ in the land in order to _RARE_ little me
had succeeded not only in _RARE_ the _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' and _RARE_ of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so _RARE_ as to _RARE_ any lawyer in the nation from representing me
ready , like _RARE_ , to present my own brief
Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case
was _RARE_ voted down and `` thrown out ''
my name was on all the front pages
, it seemed , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ in every quarter , but not entirely without a _RARE_ following of noted political _RARE_ and students of _RARE_
Evans _RARE_ said , `` Miss _RARE_ limitations as an _RARE_ are _RARE_ only by her logic as a _RARE_ ''
was quoted as saying : `` The _RARE_ of the woman's mind _RARE_ me ''
spoke of me as `` utterly _RARE_ ''
wrote : `` _RARE_ _RARE_ is the most original _RARE_ since _RARE_ '' , and even _RARE_ had to _RARE_ that `` if the rest of this nation showed the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of Miss _RARE_ , America would rapidly _RARE_ ancient _RARE_ and _RARE_ ''
were the court costs _RARE_ , but I was subjected to _RARE_ _RARE_ , in addition to _RARE_ interest on the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' which the government claimed that _RARE_ and I _RARE_ -- a severe financial blow
as _RARE_ said , had the _RARE_ done my career `` any good ''
were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , and even `` _RARE_ ''

now with pride to the fact that , long _RARE_ the Committee on _RARE_ _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , the Economic Council and other such _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' organizations were so much as heard of , I was _RARE_ leading _RARE_ against communism , fighting _RARE_ `` _RARE_ _RARE_ '' against such _RARE_ odds as the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and an army of more than _RARE_ million _RARE_ whom _RARE_ employed _RARE_ , through the _RARE_ _RARE_ of regular `` relief '' checks
say , my art suffered _RARE_ during this _RARE_ period
do otherwise
I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no _RARE_ can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her _RARE_ , her home and her nation itself are all _RARE_
_RARE_ are hardly _RARE_ to `` _RARE_ '' _RARE_ _RARE_
my _RARE_ , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe
through my _RARE_ effort and _RARE_ ) achieved _RARE_ , a fortune and a _RARE_ wife at an age when most young men are _RARE_ their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all
`` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow _RARE_ -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss _RARE_ _RARE_ and `` _RARE_ '' had never learned his part
Letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , I was the one to be patient , helpful and _RARE_ while he _RARE_ in _RARE_ of _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ , _RARE_ others , going into `` _RARE_ '' and , on more occasions than I care to count , _RARE_ off the `` set '' for the rest of the day
his _RARE_ , I was never _RARE_ to know exactly how much money Letch had `` _RARE_ away ''
I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even _RARE_ bills at his _RARE_ and the Los Angeles _RARE_ Club
did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a _RARE_ jaw
that is another story
for his private _RARE_ , they were rapidly _RARE_ in drinking , _RARE_ and _RARE_
once I was confronted by professional _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' , loan `` _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ , `` _RARE_ '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to _RARE_ my husband's _RARE_ losses , `` or else '' I _RARE_ to think that someone so dear to me could even _RARE_ with such a sinister _RARE_
three different times during our _RARE_ marriage strange girls , with the _RARE_ of _RARE_ , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had _RARE_ their _RARE_ children
_RARE_ of _RARE_ _RARE_ , my heart fairly _RARE_ when I thought of the darling pink and white `` _RARE_ from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband
, you're too old '' , was invariably his _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ whenever I suggested `` starting a family ''
made it _RARE_ clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter
felt it _RARE_ to keep _RARE_ in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of _RARE_ all year around
only made Letch more distant and _RARE_ and , in the hurry of buying _RARE_ _RARE_ , I had neglected to consider a room for _RARE_ , so there was no place to put her , anyhow
sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these _RARE_ little _RARE_ of memory
always works out for the best
I _RARE_ this man , Letch _RARE_ , why , I cannot say
heart and a brave smile , I _RARE_ his long _RARE_ from _RARE_ _RARE_ , his _RARE_ , his indifference , his _RARE_ and his _RARE_
I can recall when I was publicly _RARE_ by him -- lovely dinner parties in our _RARE_ _RARE_ where the _RARE_ was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and _RARE_ at a table where the _RARE_ chair was vacant ; ; a `` _RARE_ party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public _RARE_ , when Letch and a certain _RARE_ stayed _RARE_ together for the better part of an hour ; ; a lovely _RARE_ party at _RARE_ _RARE_ , on which sacred occasion Letch _RARE_ away with an unknown `` _RARE_ '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could
but a sampling of the _RARE_ I _RARE_
Letch _RARE_ , was it any wonder that I , once the social _RARE_ of _RARE_ , was _RARE_ from the smart _RARE_ given by the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ and such _RARE_ , closely _RARE_ families as the _RARE_ and the _RARE_
_RARE_ conduct increased , our _RARE_ decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' gathering
and _RARE_ Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both _RARE_ and commercially , than the one before it
joint venture , _RARE_ Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother _RARE_ , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the _RARE_ of _RARE_ first saint in November , _RARE_ , was a _RARE_ from start to finish
was playing Mother _RARE_ , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me
order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a _RARE_ _RARE_ who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the _RARE_ example of Mother _RARE_
he appreciate my efforts on his behalf
trouble to _RARE_ the very small part which I had `` _RARE_ '' to his _RARE_ , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches
show the rest of the cast -- _RARE_ four thousand -- the consideration of _RARE_ at the studio _RARE_ -- or even at all
not
shooting '' went on for eight months
our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ gambling _RARE_ , a certain `` residential club for young _RARE_ '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club
_RARE_ to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_
many _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general
time the film was released we were three million dollars _RARE_ , war was _RARE_ and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother _RARE_
Letch _RARE_ and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and _RARE_
_RARE_ seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss _RARE_ has _RARE_ the most _RARE_ argument for the _RARE_ faith yet _RARE_ by Hollywood ''
was small _RARE_
rare fit of anger and spite , I `` _RARE_ out '' my own husband to a small and most _RARE_ studio to make one picture as a form of punishment
actor must have discipline
film was called The _RARE_ of _RARE_ , which I felt was just what Letch deserved
out to be a life of Martin _RARE_ , of all things
a _RARE_
, Letch simply did not project
laughed off the screen
same time , however , I _RARE_ myself of the services of that great English actor and master of _RARE_ , Sir _RARE_ _RARE_ , to do a `` _RARE_ '' called The _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_ , in which I played a young American girl who _RARE_ a haunted _RARE_ on the English _RARE_ which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , _RARE_ to anyone , is still occupied by an _RARE_ _RARE_
a `` _RARE_ '' made on a `` _RARE_ '' and not the sort of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal
was not in it , but , _RARE_ enough , it remains the most _RARE_ successful picture of my career
watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later
had returned from his _RARE_ _RARE_ and more badly behaved than before
loved that boy , and , in a _RARE_ attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to _RARE_ the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my _RARE_ to _RARE_ , hoping that her _RARE_ advice would help me
I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his _RARE_ energy '' , I said
is Letch interested in ''
, _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , _RARE_ said _RARE_
_RARE_ me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference
can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , I said
date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it
his fault that these things were so
was that each day seemed to produce its _RARE_ of details which must be cleaned up immediately
result , life had become a kind of continuous _RARE_
_RARE_ of these items which screamed so _RARE_ for attention , he could _RARE_ the things which really counted
at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just _RARE_ through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs

almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams
had always been _RARE_ around him on these _RARE_ , _RARE_ with delight , _RARE_ off into the _RARE_ on _RARE_ hunting _RARE_ , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy _RARE_
something to one's ego
constantly _RARE_ you that you were one of the world's great guys
how much of a _RARE_ you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference
became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture
the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons
couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous _RARE_
the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to
him , this _RARE_ to get the _RARE_ things done in the course of a day
wake up in the middle of the night and _RARE_ about it
the world had he _RARE_ found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work _RARE_ on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a _RARE_ brief case
possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed
be that it _RARE_ up for the _RARE_ in some mysterious way , as if a _RARE_ universe were _RARE_ through the end of the chapter just to get it over with
the answer less metaphysical
people work more slowly
take a man of _RARE_ longer to write a letter , _RARE_ , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty
become _RARE_ as they grew older , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , reluctant to let go
be that certain people were born with a _RARE_ to _RARE_ their lives , while others could live _RARE_ _RARE_ almost _RARE_ , like _RARE_ in the sun , too _RARE_ to _RARE_ their eyes
was his _RARE_ , or good fortune , _RARE_ way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was _RARE_ _RARE_ to it
again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after _RARE_ : reading , _RARE_ , _RARE_ , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them
no _RARE_ behind them
be done or left _RARE_ and nobody really gave a damn
his busy life he had only done things which had to be done
had become so fixed over the years that it seemed _RARE_ to do anything for which no one was waiting
at the luminous _RARE_ of his wrist watch
five minutes after four
distant farm a _RARE_ _RARE_ and , far down the valley , an _RARE_ answered
over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the _RARE_ _RARE_ of the dawn
he could buy the equipment for his workshop
, action might follow
down to Mills and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ and bought a full set of _RARE_ tools , including a _RARE_ power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for _RARE_ and _RARE_ , whatever they were
bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , _RARE_ and _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_ , levels and T squares and _RARE_ lines and several _RARE_ that he had no idea how to use or what they were for
'' , said Mr. Mills
get you started
to get everything at once
as you find you need 'em ''
even ask the cost of this collection
, if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that
returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , _RARE_ had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car
glad
him a chance to _RARE_ the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a _RARE_ of acid comments
made such a _RARE_ about buying that second car that he knew he was _RARE_
everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall
where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools
of it would be his workbench
nightmare which had caused him so many _RARE_ hours came _RARE_ in on him once more , only this time he couldn't _RARE_ it with a sleeping pill and send it away
the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall
one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter
pegboard there would be the _RARE_
down on an old box and focused on the problem
_RARE_ holes in the stone with some kind of an electric _RARE_
, when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again
seemed rather _RARE_
his attention to the workbench
was the first thing to do
had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't _RARE_ like a _RARE_ _RARE_ and ultimately _RARE_ when you leaned on it
had done some _RARE_ on a _RARE_ of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and _RARE_ which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench
on the cellar floor in a _RARE_ pile
_RARE_ at it _RARE_ with his foot
anyone know what to do with an _RARE_ like that
had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about
least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on
everything should be _RARE_
upstairs to phone _RARE_
amazement he reached him
was laid up with a bad cold
seem to think that _RARE_ a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the _RARE_ equally lightly
trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job
why he hadn't been able to finish the porch
he didn't know of any _RARE_
any such thing any more
wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer _RARE_ for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job
a fellow named Blatz over _RARE_ way
to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk
would probably see him at _RARE_ _RARE_ the next night
was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie
had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest _RARE_ that had come into Mr. _RARE_ life since he moved to _RARE_ , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him
he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you
Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. _RARE_ mind from funny things
same time he watched carefully to see how one attached _RARE_ to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to _RARE_ his ignorance
Blatz was putting up the _RARE_ and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about _RARE_ the whole end of the cellar
agreed that this would be pretty
discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards _RARE_ over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the _RARE_ , which he then stained and _RARE_ according to his taste
'' , he said , `` we got to put in some _RARE_ for them power tools ; ; then a couple of _RARE_ _RARE_ over the workbench an' I guess we're about through down here ''
did look very efficient and _RARE_
no question of that
the way '' , said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a _RARE_ _RARE_ , `` them power tools needs extra voltage
you know about that
use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new _RARE_ box for the extra _RARE_
too bad _RARE_ the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do _RARE_ ''
being _RARE_ by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved
the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools
Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs
, Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking _RARE_
sat down in the only _RARE_ kitchen chair
'' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there
be able to build a new house with all them _RARE_ ''
watched his wife with an anxious expression
was just _RARE_ to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done ''
couldn't remember his saying any such thing
, that's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie
have a thousand things for you to do
won't open , and doors that won't close and _RARE_ and broken -- '' `` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie
are the things I can do , now that I'm set up ''
been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said
won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- _RARE_ be plenty more ''
discussion was academic
was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink
in English has been _RARE_ as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences
said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. _RARE_
English by Greek ''
_RARE_ said , `` I think the _RARE_ is the _RARE_ to be understood of the two ''
_RARE_ American _RARE_ remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning ''
many types of _RARE_ and many of them have been described by _RARE_ under such names as _RARE_ , _RARE_ , and other _RARE_
_RARE_ they would be described as _RARE_ -- _RARE_ , _RARE_ , _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
of _RARE_ _RARE_ to _RARE_ by _RARE_ repetition
you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said ''
, _RARE_ Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we ''
exercises compound confusion by making it worse _RARE_ , and they are sometimes expanded until the _RARE_ of the _RARE_ _RARE_
a _RARE_ kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in
terribly upset '' , she told a _RARE_
wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't mean to _RARE_ my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have _RARE_ me ''

_RARE_ is another species more _RARE_ in the _RARE_ of _RARE_ than in the _RARE_
an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word
familiar to all _RARE_ is the _RARE_ : `` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a _RARE_ _RARE_
you tell me who was drunk -- The man , his wife , or me ''

years _RARE_ have discovered this brand of _RARE_ and thus the _RARE_ _RARE_ has acquired a new habitat in the _RARE_

pleading for the heart that _RARE_ up when it _RARE_ a _RARE_ in the sky , or for the heart that with _RARE_ _RARE_ and _RARE_ with the _RARE_
pure heart of _RARE_ is gone with the _RARE_ years , but I still believe in the heart of the George Meredith character that was not made of the stuff that _RARE_ ''
no longer have Tom _RARE_ and _RARE_ ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , I said

you think we need a new Henry James to _RARE_ the _RARE_ scene ''

perhaps a new _RARE_ _RARE_ ''

hear it said constantly -- in _RARE_
, there is usually a group of _RARE_ with _RARE_ problems , worthy of being _RARE_ either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and _RARE_ ''
up and began _RARE_
you are trying to get us out of the _RARE_ , the _RARE_ , the kitchen sink , and the _RARE_ _RARE_ , you are probably _RARE_ your time '' , Moreland told me
many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the _RARE_ or from under the rock ''
and _RARE_ '' , I said
am worried about the current meanings of the word funny
means ominous , as when one _RARE_ of a funny sound in the motor ; ; disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; ; and _RARE_ , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights ''

you remember the woman in the French _RARE_ who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened _RARE_
the sheep , ' The world is coming to an end '

_RARE_ of sheep is like the _RARE_ horse laugh ''

you saw the drama called _RARE_ '' , I said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of _RARE_ when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a _RARE_
would panic , screaming help
that can be screamed in their language ''
think the _RARE_ are getting ahead of us in comedy ''

, no '' , I said
political and intellectual _RARE_ began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as _RARE_ and _RARE_ , such as humor and comedy
like any other human being upon whom the _RARE_ of the world plays continually , _RARE_ , the _RARE_ _RARE_ , has become a _RARE_ actor , or thinks he has
famous meeting with _RARE_ a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed _RARE_
like _RARE_ , he has only one joke , so far as I can find out
in saying , ' That would be sending the _RARE_ to look after the _RARE_
the name of his _RARE_ doesn't he vary it a bit ''
as ''

a _RARE_ fall was there ''

over to stare at his _RARE_ again , and then came back and sat down , _RARE_
world that was once _RARE_ and _RARE_ '' , he said , `` has now become _RARE_ and _RARE_
age of Science and _RARE_ it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our _RARE_ and explore outer space ''
human ego being what it is '' , I put in , `` science _RARE_ has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic _RARE_ fruit _RARE_
to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species ''
we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , Moreland protested
in the largest sense of the words '' , I said
other day _RARE_ _RARE_ spoke against the _RARE_ tendency of our species to believe in the _RARE_ of its religions , its _RARE_ , and its virtually everything else
we not realize that no _RARE_ believes so much in itself as it _RARE_ in something else
ago an English writer , W. L. George , dealt with this subject in _RARE_ of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' _RARE_ George for _RARE_ England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ dead ' ''
was also _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_ , or if you will , _RARE_ _RARE_ _RARE_

not only _RARE_ but it also _RARE_ the mad
a bitter _RARE_ for a future writer in that ''
_RARE_ has always been clearly written and readily _RARE_ '' , I said
we now find writers _RARE_ by the _RARE_ and _RARE_ of their ivory _RARE_ , and curiously devoted to the growing _RARE_ and _RARE_ of poetry and _RARE_
a few years ago that one of the _RARE_ rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about
, the children had wanted to get up onto General _RARE_ horse
to see what his back felt like -- the _RARE_
so comfortable being straight
to touch the mystery
_RARE_ them up when the policeman came by
very _RARE_
a hard voice , too , this time
eyes rather _RARE_ for a second ; ; but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it wasn't for these dear children '' --
got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady : I know you got to _RARE_ these kids and all
is a public park and it's a city _RARE_ that the _RARE_ cannot be crawled on ''
so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir ''
walked on , but he looked back once
happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred
taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; and they had told their mother about the _RARE_
of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ; and so they were consistently true to their principles
mind '' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having _RARE_ the usual _RARE_ course of _RARE_
mind
something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn ''
is it ''
children , whose _RARE_ and _RARE_ were invariably so _RARE_ normal and _RARE_
was why they were _RARE_ and loyal towards the _RARE_ of Arlene
you wait '' , advised Arlene , _RARE_ the _RARE_ in a recent British movie
they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most _RARE_ magnificent time
Arlene had put them through some rapid _RARE_
protested that that wasn't any surprise
you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were _RARE_ the pleasantly _RARE_ _RARE_ of that _RARE_ little sturdy statement
is a _RARE_ ''
it anything like _RARE_ _RARE_ ''
of the children
the least bit '' , Arlene snapped
the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions
especially the ones that all other _RARE_ laughed at _RARE_
sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously
hard for very long
enough to make you feel important
'' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms _RARE_ down and feel comfortable
, we're going to be like what General Burnside and his horse make us think of ''
looked at each other and _RARE_ their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever
went _RARE_ out of _RARE_
Arlene threw herself _RARE_ and _RARE_ in a way that was just wonderful
herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked
being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said
laughed and winked back
General _RARE_ horse , _RARE_ down '' , Arlene said , sort of _RARE_ , for her : even she had to _RARE_ kind of funny when she was in that position
General _RARE_ _RARE_ belly do so funny when it was _RARE_ down
she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling )
would wink and throw _RARE_
tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and _RARE_ tremble
kept on _RARE_ for a long , long time
time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on _RARE_ a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing
has something to do with General Burnside and his horse ''
, it was so grand ; ; they could tell exactly what it was
General _RARE_ horse running in a circle
shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders
the _RARE_ horse '' , one of them cried out
remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That's a funny old horse ''
one said , `` He sure does shake
''
was the General _RARE_ his wife
to be told that one
was even _RARE_ after they had been told
, when he came back from those many business trips , just _RARE_ their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to _RARE_ the _RARE_ and put them in the electric _RARE_
General Burnside
the _RARE_ man
could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet
they had to get up and be General Burnside
horse
could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out
very funny
they said General Burnside was going to jump over his _RARE_ head ; ; and they did some _RARE_
wasn't very funny , either
ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them
showed them how to begin
taught them to sing `` I wish I could _RARE_ like my sister Kate ''
a lot
_RARE_ , but they were beginning to catch on
caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling
you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , Arlene suggested
a great deal
a little late in getting home
sorry , Mrs. _RARE_ '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it
_RARE_ herself the voice of all of us
perfectly _RARE_ , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way
suppose you all were playing and forgot ''
, _RARE_ '' , the children _RARE_ heartily
help laughing
rushed off to get rid of their _RARE_ ; ; and Arlene began _RARE_ the kitchen door open
a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ; but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded
had a slight _RARE_ quality
really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed
lip lifted slightly
_RARE_ into a small red radish ; ; and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the _RARE_ of the thing
she lived in _RARE_ fear of finding a white _RARE_ curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish
try to see over the _RARE_ of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was _RARE_
worked , naturally ; ; but it made her look unusual
when she had _RARE_ off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; ; and she would _RARE_ the _RARE_ half of the radish out to where she could inspect it
hear a very faint , _RARE_ sigh of relief
it was _RARE_ to anyone not expecting it
warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public
, the children told her further about _RARE_
must be awfully good for them
kind of Arlene '' , she told us later
do you know something curious ''

reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress
no notion why I reached
found a radish
an _RARE_
for a second
would not _RARE_ myself in that silly way
the window and threw the radish out ''
my mother blushed at this small lie ; ; for she knew and we knew that it was _RARE_ that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain
_RARE_ ; ; nobody could have told why

in the air
of my father's came to dinner
passing through town and _RARE_ to say _RARE_

matter of fact , this happened every four or five months
he _RARE_ with my father's being at home
as at this _RARE_ , he did not
was always persuaded out

had left , I could never remember whether he had _RARE_ them in their _RARE_ , _RARE_ , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look
_RARE_ him , too
, they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of _RARE_ distributed over them
been some _RARE_ in it , for I remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a _RARE_ bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a _RARE_
pushed gently into the room by Arlene -- whose only part _RARE_ were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door
just sat down
Mr. Gorboduc what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , _RARE_
an air of _RARE_ about the children -- even _RARE_ for their own principles

the _RARE_ _RARE_ had brought up bitter problems of administration
at the beginning , this stayed just in the air

_RARE_ _RARE_ Mr. Gorboduc

, between _RARE_ of laughter
forced to wipe his eyes
don't step on the flowers , do you

the children _RARE_ out of range of the _RARE_ index finger
'' , he said
don't ''
took a _RARE_ of his _RARE_
so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her _RARE_ for _RARE_
this was done when attention was _RARE_ by someone _RARE_ long , _RARE_ story
time she was nervous : she was open
was finally in command of his mind again
me -- what do you do at the park ''

delivered in a _RARE_ way , without _RARE_ and _RARE_ interest -- an _RARE_ way with children
_RARE_ , he could not remove from his voice a nagging _RARE_ of the direct command
the children into the _RARE_ of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret _RARE_ over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of _RARE_ and _RARE_ _RARE_
_RARE_ '' , one said ; ; and the other went on to development of the idea
_RARE_ , too '' , he said
was beside herself with curiosity
that again '' , she _RARE_
a little and tossed the _RARE_ _RARE_ around in her glass

, probably very few people know that the word `` _RARE_ '' that is _RARE_ about so much today stems from the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' : to _RARE_
and equally _RARE_ , is the news that such unlikely _RARE_ as `` _RARE_ '' , `` _RARE_ '' , and the _RARE_ `` _RARE_ '' all originated in the same village in _RARE_ _RARE_ and are all used to express _RARE_ concerning British `` _RARE_ ''

, when the film is only four minutes old , _RARE_ refers to a small , _RARE_ piano stool as `` _RARE_ '' , and we are _RARE_ subjected to a _RARE_ that _RARE_ us that this very piano stool was once used by an _RARE_ _RARE_ whose name , of course , was _RARE_ ( the English equivalent , when passed through _RARE_ _RARE_ , of _RARE_ )

find out at the end , it is not the stool ( _RARE_ _RARE_ , therefore the English ) that he is _RARE_ but the piece of _RARE_ blind
