time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties
vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable
principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly
other than employee need contributed to the growth
immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees
of increase does not signify anything in itself
not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy
does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees
past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now
were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical
is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them
operation of the motor pool
origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly
1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned
included all phases of management
determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters
, however , the nation was at war
automobile tires were rationed commodities
was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual
these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation
pool then , as now , had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state
organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation
the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government
of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : `` Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made
of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars
maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis
of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 , while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% , the total maintenance cost increased only 11%
order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by Executive Order , to the Division of Methods , Research and Office Services
behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles
: So far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division )
in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive
it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet ; ; for example , if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year , their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years , rather than 44,000 miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and 16,000 miles respectively ''
pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation
all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs
with outside repair garages for much of the latter work
pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses
reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be traded for sound economies
, motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data
, vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile
this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles
further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled , the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year
shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random
of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities
quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , antiquated and , in general , make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment
would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more

of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state
made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made
evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders
for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public
are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay
the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers
ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier
a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles
and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later
, assignment , and use policies Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles
role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles
meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration
Island property tax There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well
years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax
was discontinued in 1936
time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years
same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well
there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments
assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , insufficient for their requirements
have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level
aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax
being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored
tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property
taxing personal property
many problems in the taxing of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value
are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states
property
laws of the various states , in general , specify the situs of property , i.e. , residence or domicile of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment
law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated
provides for the taxation of all personal property , belonging to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and intangible , and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state
personal property , it specifically mentions `` all ships or vessels , at home or abroad ''
is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year
similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is cancelled out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property '' situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated
seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on December 31
and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles
of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged
it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December
of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft
example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport Airpark in Middletown , to the North Central Airport in Smithfield
resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably
its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year ''
tax assessor , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated ''
value
of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors , who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem
for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island
will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted
Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented : `` The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property
staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State
statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units ''
of Public Administration , in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959 , recommended `` consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job ''
setup , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island ''
Rhode Island
the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island
from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case
legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town
of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time
to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not
of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations
checked boats only , another trailers and tractors , one mentioned house trailers , and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type
cases , airplanes only were indicated
difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes
indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats
seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property
answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive
towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind
interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership
that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer
stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property , and only five were opposed
expressed no opinion
point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now
not clear , however , whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats , trailers , aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns
that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner
for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides
made no reply
who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred
one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date
, it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge
for greater knowledge is evident from their replies
personal property taxing of boats
been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats
Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than '' a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting
been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach
professional organization , the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed
solution has been found , but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors
been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats
obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation
known that at least five towns ( Barrington , Bristol , Narragansett , Newport and Westerly ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes
few are taxed , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations
really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be
than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law
few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close
association , meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem
investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960's industrial development effort
started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000 ; ; a new post-World War 2 , record
exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here
these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs
major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R. I. Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls
that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc. Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W. R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company
relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development Council's Industrial Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation
personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island concerns during 1960 , many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location
conscious of this state's new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island
small business Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries , small business is also afforded considerable attention
of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous program , directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories
function is the operation of a Government Bid Center , which receives bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies
rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations , where to obtain specifications , and follow-ups concerning qualification
past year , 10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers
, the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ; ; how and where to apply for financial assistance ; ; details on marketing ; ; information concerning patents , copyrights and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business
of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also active in the field of international trade , assisting Rhode Island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad
cooperates with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; ; locating foreign agents , buyers , distributors , etc. ; ; information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations , licensing , investments , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment
year 1960 , this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made 73 field visits
Our media advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100% financing , plant availabilities , and location advantages
continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here
a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000 , and the Industrial Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 to $20,000
was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Eastern and Midwestern editions ) which averaged two prominent ads per month , and to a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and , for the west coast , the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Pacific Coast edition )
to the regular schedule , advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times , Boston Herald , American Banker , Electronic News and , for local promotion , the Providence Sunday Journal
included Management Methods , The New Englander , U. S. Investor , and Plant Location
mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , pharmaceutical , and business machine manufacturers , and to publishers
6,768 pieces of correspondence
advertising campaign brought a total of 239 inquiries ; ; 164 from media and 75 from direct mail
and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries
led in the number of inquiries , followed by California , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Pennsylvania
countries responding were Germany , Canada , Brazil and India
An important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term `` Missionary calls '' by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists
of visits , without previous announcement , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas
25 carefully selected cities were visited , including New York , Brooklyn , Long Island City , Newark , Elizabeth , Stamford , Waterbury , New Haven , Bridgeport , Boston , Cambridge , Worcester , and Waltham
a total of 603 calls , 452 contacts were established with top executive personnel
76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages , and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits
During 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the Development Council's Industrial Division
, the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce -- in conjunction with local trade associations , chambers of commerce , and bank officials -- sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel
was to find ways of offsetting the United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959
representatives of business attended this conclave and the R. I. Export Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event
8th of last year , the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor's Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School
program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals
included addresses by Ward Miller , Jr. of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce
, executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , and Edwin C. Kepler of General Electric Company
in the afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Maine , and rounded out a rewarding program
with this conference , a 64-page supplement was published in the October 2nd edition of The Providence Sunday Journal
the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division
2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients
publications Other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's Conference , letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors
of the R. I. Directory Of Manufacturers were distributed : 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state
Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial brochure , `` Rhode Island -- Right For Industry '' , and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space catalogue
activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation Turnkey , the new automated post office , and a conference with representatives of Brown University , Providence College , and University of Rhode Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel
Stated in its simplest terms , the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island
of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council , which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning
ago , the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` State-Local Relations In Metropolitan Rhode Island
result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in this report , plus an analysis of our own enabling act , the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program
are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division
) First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state
) Recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that `` Metropolian Planning ( in Rhode Island ) means , or should mean , state planning '' , the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems
) It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government
end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff
) The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ; ; among the operating departments of the state ; ; between the cities and towns of the state ; ; and on a regional basis between the six New England states
) On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such as water ) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan
) The state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan
) In preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation
planning division carries out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ; ; and the preparation of the state development budget
planning The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation
aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation
program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete
-- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department of Public Works -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated
mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961
Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet , covering the entire state
maps completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started
the aid of matching federal funds available under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended , the planning division began a one year program July 1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program
consists of four items : urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public utility service areas
validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible
land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning
land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use
of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961
collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose
in Rhode island
not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island
a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government
forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority )
special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers
and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits
not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government
to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000
in other states comparative data
of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report
the findings are : 1
, including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30
four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( Sept. 30 ) , New York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and Texas ( August 31 )

states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Massachusetts , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii )

states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 ( Arkansas , Colorado , Indiana , Kansas , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Ohio , South Dakota , Utah , Washington , and Wisconsin )

states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 : : ( Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Virginia , and South Carolina )

, Alabama , closes its fiscal year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on September 30

its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30

its fiscal year on May 31
its cities close their fiscal years on December 31
twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments
only Illinois , Oregon , Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity
: advantages and disadvantages advantages
summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently
among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1
fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending

fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn
towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts

fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures
the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures

fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements
simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting

fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes
tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes , augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy

fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures
have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; ; and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases
different fiscal years are difficult to compare
advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes
anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times
be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants
event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary
would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most
of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year
toward such a system looks toward saving and security
be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year
federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on July 1
of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below : It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap ; ; but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true
fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships

are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered
more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle
is a matter of shifting dates ; ; the other , is how to finance the transition
be done about the changing of dates
an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars
means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time
and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem
problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns
be covered more fully later
be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city
there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change
have to be made in some cases , but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely
fiscal calendars The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them
of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed
are immediately evident
the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula
the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns
at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; ; the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary
matter is considered in detail in a later section
and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar
from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end
important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them
of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought
it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved
needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below
needed
and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it
is required for these towns
include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North Kingstown , and South Kingstown
fiscal year
and one city , Coventry and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only
will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year
tax collection year
and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity
and towns include Bristol , Glocester , Pawtucket , Cumberland , Central Falls , and Woonsocket

to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an enigma
excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars
neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year
to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them
both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30
installment dates would be : October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston )
start their new fiscal year on July 1
collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ; ; and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston )
plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods

twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30
these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years
adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3
financing adjustments Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary
be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements
communities there is simply no financial problem ; ; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques
municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes
such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule
earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars
, no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition
practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ; each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval
range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds
problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period
communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem

Medical Publication Agency The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency , established in 1949 , has published , since January 1950 , The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services
, The Medical Technicians Bulletin , supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel
replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin , published continuously from 1907 through 1959 , as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department , published from 1922 to 1949
, their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin
savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service , were between $65,000 and $70,000
on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage
July 1958 to 30 June 1960 , 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published
contained articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devoted to military medical news , reviews of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services
on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled , `` This Is Your A.M.A. ''
the October 1959 issue of the Journal , the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting
in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds
of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds
issues were published , one for November 1959 on Space Medicine , the other the Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960
1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled , `` The Medical Officer Writes ''
discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin , publication of which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue , a section called `` Technical Notes '' was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue
were published on historical medicine , special reports , bibliography , and `` Collector's Items ''
1960 , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the `` Medical Museum '' , and in June , the Institute started contributing a regular monthly `` Case For Diagnosis ''
also planned to furnish a regular series of articles , beginning in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant Scientific Exhibits
Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions , so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces
report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal
achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile
gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago
are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride
and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion
of these , an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Af and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved
of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent
is considered very good for such short time intervals
of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter
is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy
used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element
shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion
consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part
method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires
of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera
action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil
discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera
shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds
aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil
of interstellar radio spectra
well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules
and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres
most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; ; somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and Aj
concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; ; in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as Af molecules per Af may be sufficient , as compared to the Af hydrogen atom's Af required for detection of the 21-cm line
in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible
precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started
methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead
the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor , which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity
diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical
this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas ; ; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 Af , with an uncertainty of 0.10 Af
observing these spectral lines has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; ; extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported
being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals
thermometry
is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af
and accomplishments fall into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium-4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 )

interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 Af
interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement , and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer
of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium-4 vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found
is preliminary , and work is continuing

and impurity-doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region
resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 Af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium
of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 Af at every 0.1 Af
standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree ; ; and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegrees
method
of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 Af
gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15- and 25-liter metallic storage dewars
was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 Af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point
head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium
the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface
also been observed , in helium 2 , that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer
been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer
case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow
for pvt measurements
measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer
which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested
is a null-type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in. thick and 1 in. in diameter
pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in. apart ( for Af )
backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit
temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one millimeter of mercury
of air
study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed
was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command , U.S. Air Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding
effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region
discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present
of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 Af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density
activities
, 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The Netherlands , United Kingdom , U.S.S.R. , United States , and West Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 Af
first step toward this goal , arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory
group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the Aj
have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory

last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature , Its Measurement And Control In Science And Industry
, which was jointly sponsored by the American Institute of Physics , the Instrument Society of America , and the National Bureau of Standards , attracted nearly one thousand registrants , including many from abroad
contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack , General Chairman , and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld , Program Chairman
V. Astin , NBS Director , opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories

In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics
in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation
centers have been established for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross sections


sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and the Advanced Research Projects Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities
survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued
and tables of available data are now in preparation
high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen
will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements
of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent
of tables containing spectral intensities for 39,000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published
the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities
are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned , but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas
levels
on the very complex spectra of the rare earth elements
and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success

, for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have
of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two
solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service
been a number of sound plans proposed
of these has been implemented
have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand
number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957
this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area
New York Central Railroad , one of the Nation's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949
time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad's proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads
York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C. & O. - B. & O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central
is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area
York Central notes : `` The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. & O. - B. & O. provides the backbone of Central's revenues
make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services
services are to be maintained , the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible ''
York Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City
a $14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively
to this phase of the Central's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself , but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city
is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. & O. - B. & O. merger scheme '' -- The Central has pointed out
logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. & O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here
of the plan were well underway
from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their investors , their customers , their users , and to the public at large
abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. & O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. & O. which resulted in the present situation
light of the facts at hand , however , New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest ''
Commerce Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C. & O. - B. & O. merger on June 18
the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge
there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss
, will it serve the long-range public interest
past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway system
ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter -- the two-way B. & O. - C. & O. merger , or the three-way New York Central - B. & O. - C. & O. merger
serve not only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public

, I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New York Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command
Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement
pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times
successor as publisher is Mr. Orvil E. Dryfoos , who is president of the New York Times Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942
outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's great newspapers will be maintained
also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor
succeeds Charles Merz , editor since 1938 , who now becomes editor emeritus
like at this time , Mr. Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism
congratulations go to their successors , Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes , who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times
of the 17th District of New York , and I as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world

, in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine
I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages
to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the U.S. News & World Report : `` your Congressman , Samuel S. Stratton , reports from Washington , May 1 , 1961
: Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week , there was at least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base
, one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment
the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home
and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States , violate the Monroe Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic
full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone
Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board
the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro's representative from secret military talks
took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job
a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week
see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past
next move will be only time , of course , will tell
I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba
can't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba
we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk
blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere ''
from U.s. News & World Report , May 8 , 1961 ) next for Cuba : an arms blockade
Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas
the United States act
one answer offered by experts
they see a way to isolate Cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish Castro , too
the question now facing President Kennedy : How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere
25 , the White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered
: To undermine further Cuba's economy

-- bolder and tougher -- was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro
in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine
halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro
stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America
be the most severe reprisal , short of declared war , that the United States could invoke against Castro
the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon
possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions
questions : what would a Cuba blockade take
say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers
, on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba
36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day's sailing time away
out the blockading force , submarines would be needed -- to locate , identify and track approaching vessels
would help with this task
radar picket ships
of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces
go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; ; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; ; and it must be enforced without discrimination
conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk
can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- searched and held , at least temporarily
be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated
a blockade accomplish
say the experts
broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere
, by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration
would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia
arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband
total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs
, three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports
inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 , 66th Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment
for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in 1935
this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job
limitations of such a program , the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure

successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled
the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P. L. 565 )
to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's overall effectiveness

law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis
L. 113 , 78th Congress , the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services
years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act
Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a three-part grant structure -- for ( 1 ) basic support ; ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation -- and in addition for short-term training and instruction
part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section
on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure
table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program : method of distributing funds description of formula
to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income
further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State
, in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums
are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State
are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone
computing allotments
used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act
`` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia , and excludes the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii
steps are employed in calculations : 1
State ( except Puerto Rico , Guam , the Virgin Islands , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) determine average per capita income based on the last three years
Source of Data , below for per capita income data to be used in this step

average per capita income for the U. S. based on the last three years
Source of Data , below , for per capita income data to be used in this step

ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U. S. ( Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above

each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U. S.
the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above

particular State's `` allotment percentage ''
this is 75% for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico
and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-1/3% nor more than 75%
resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes , the State's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme

State's allotment percentage

State's population
Source of Data , below for population data to be used in this step

population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage
result obtained in item 7 above , by result obtained in item 6 above

sum of the products obtained in item 8 above , for all the States
each State , make all computations set forth in items 1 to 8 above , and then add the results obtained for each State in item 8

ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the States
the amount being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above

particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year
the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above

the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is greater than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment
State's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year , which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000 , must be reduced by the amount of the excess

the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment
its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000

recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum
on allotments
States which maintain two separate agencies -- one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind -- the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954
in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine
explanation of matching formula
the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula
1960 , in order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds
and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a pivot of 40% State ( or 60% Federal ) participation in total program costs
of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State's `` Federal share ''
of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the State's `` unadjusted Federal share ''
1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) 25% a year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and 30% , respectively
rate of Federal participation with respect to any State's base allotment , as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that State's `` adjusted Federal Share ''
for determining a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States
of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates
computing Federal shares
used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the Act
`` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii
steps are employed in the calculations : 1
State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , determine the average per capita income for the last three years
same amount used in item 1 under Method Of Computing Allotments , above

average per capita income for the United States for the last three years
same amount used in item 2 under Method Of Computing Allotments , above

ratio of 40% to the average per capita income of the United States
40 by the amount used in item 2 above

each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the United States
the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above

particular State's `` Federal Share ''
this is 70% for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico
and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962
all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; except that no State shall have a Federal share less than 50% nor more than 70%
resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes , the State's Federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme
entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall
4-inch space is filled by mortaring blocks on edge
bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall
poured between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding
details see inset , fig. 5
first one or two roof boards ( marked `` E '' in fig. 6 ) are slipped into place across the roof beams , from outside the shelter
are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams , from inside the shelter
are passed between the beams and put on the boards
blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together
the roof continues in this way
roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter
roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position
is complete
fig. 7
plans are on page 21
blocks , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter
are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit
are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection
an alternative
are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks
in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall
instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen
of information include the National Concrete Masonry Association , 38 South Dearborn Street , Chicago , Ill. , the Portland Cement Association , 33 West Grand Avenue , Chicago , Ill. , and the Structural Clay Products Association , Washington , D.C.
shelter An outdoor , aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks
fig. 9 , double-wall shelter
people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter
on pages 22 and 23
could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface , making it impractical to build an underground shelter
of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart
between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth
are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built
shown here ( fig. 9 ) is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete , covered with at least 20 inches of pit-run gravel
roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , overlaid with boards and waterproofing
have to be covered with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel
for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700
would be additional
would provide almost absolute fallout protection
shelter Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground
particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface
effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth , as shown in figure 10
this shelter would cost about $700
probably would be required to help build it
would be added to the cost of materials
, as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation
hatchway entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials $50 to $100
Lumber Manufacturers Association , Washington , D. C. , is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction
Clay Products Institute , Washington , D.C. , is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction
shelter An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500 , depending on the type of entrance
shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection
( fig. 11 ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over
shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground level
the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27
of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction
add about $500 to the total cost of the home
illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D.C. area in the Spring of 1959
common to each type of shelter are : 1
the entrance






must have at least one right-angle turn
somewhat like light
go around a corner
continues in a straight line
sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter
provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance
may be installed to increase comfort
is essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters
provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person
also are necessary ( as shown in figs. 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but filters are not
is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation
as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made
will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts
an important consideration
lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb
shown that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days
spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured
or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed
be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas

there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29
windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens
that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29
shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide
or materials to build them , may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed
or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection

a shelter The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first
after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion
radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous
civil defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed
radio is essential
suitable for home use are available , and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation
a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available
thus would serve both purposes
civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources
tell you as soon as possible : How long to stay in your shelter ; ; How soon you may go outdoors ; ; How long you may stay outside
be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer
in the Appendix ( ( page 30 ) tells what is needed
children will have particular problems
provide for simple recreation
be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated
the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake
the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy
as diaries can be kept
of the family will depend largely on information received by radio
should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast
probably will be necessary
be operated periodically on a regular schedule
come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement
as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum
problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied
medical supplies , utensils , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it
family has settled in the shelter , the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge
the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning
emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem
container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet
garbage can , with a tightly fitting cover , could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter
will be difficult and should be planned carefully
electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates
take the chill from the shelter in the beginning
the electric power fails after an attack , any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable
in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature
and bedding , of course , are essential
or cooking should be avoided
would use up air
already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need

attack finds you without a prepared shelter Few areas , if any , are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about
dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation
ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside
protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house
basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level
place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground
is time after the warning , the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks , dirt , books , magazines , or other heavy material

apartment buildings Large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings
, such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space
area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building , with concrete floors , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling
of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling
Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many people
for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space
will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management
Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont's share of the General Motors market
communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted
few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors' eight operating divisions
Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions
to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont's capacity
fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest
is overwhelming that Du Pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit ''
S. , at 605
agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either Du Pont or General Motors ''
S. , at 606
it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including Du Pont's competitors '' , outweighed the Government's claim for relief
, as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it , 126 F.Supp.235 , alleged violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act
provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade
this Court put to one side without consideration the Government's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations
its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce
shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial lessening of competition
purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion : `` Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation
is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended
U. S. , at 589
a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's decision
as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies
however , did not bar finding that Du Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General Motors ; ; that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton Act ; ; that General Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial ; ; and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute
, that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints
upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition
U. S. , at 607
basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief
guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : `` The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute
Courts , in the framing of equitable decrees , are clothed ' with large discretion to model their judgements to fit the exigencies of the particular case
Co. v. United States , 332 U. S. 392 , 400-401 ''
S. , at 607-608
us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court

judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 , 1957
pretrial conference -- held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings -- took place on September 25 , 1957
outset , the Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court
, he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the Du Pont - General Motors relationship
, deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of Du Pont's shares of General Motors
the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days
Du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date
antitrust case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief
of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract
adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out
submitted its proposed decree on October 25 , 1957
called for divestiture by Du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years
Company and Delaware Realty & Investment Company , major stockholders in Du Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten-year period , of Du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to them , as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright
in the trustee's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten-year period
, the right to vote the General Motors stock held by Du Pont was to be vested in Du Pont's stockholders , other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; ; Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General Motors ; ; Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with General Motors , and vice versa ; ; and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent rights , or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies
of the Amici Curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government's plan
9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings
dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont's earnings and profits
, for federal income tax purposes , of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution
case of taxpaying corporate stockholders , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or Du Pont's tax basis for them , which is approximately $2.09 per share
sale of the General Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate
counterproposal was filed on May 14 , 1958
plan Du Pont would retain its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares
Delaware would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders
would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of Du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval
would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders
6 , 1958 , General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal
, inter alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; ; that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; ; that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity
comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the mandate of this Court
proposed by the amici curiae were filed in August of 1958
, like Du Pont's , contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as well as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised
also prohibited common directors , officers , or employees between Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on the one hand , and General Motors on the other
not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship
is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage
inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection
not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself
these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage
opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law ''
not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed
any event , I submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress , not to this Court

who claims to be a conscientious objector , was convicted of violating 12a of the Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces
that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice , he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim
On the record in this case , the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully complied with ; ; petitioner was not denied due process ; ; and his conviction is sustained

) Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board

) Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's notes and report , especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice's recommendation to the appeal board

) Petitioner was not entitled , either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , since he was furnished a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and showed no particular need for the original report

Covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner
Friedman argued the cause for the United States
brief were Solicitor General Rankin , Assistant Attorney General Wilkey , Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop

stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form
was classified 1-o
1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board
periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home
approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so
not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella v. United States , 348 U.S. 385 ( 1955 )
again reclassified 1-a by the local board
a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared
report to the Attorney General , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service
21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1-a classification
for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions
that he now devoted only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities
was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good faith ''
board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation
answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952
board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation
of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so
contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching
statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file
that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer
failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file
never took the trouble to find out
had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board
recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial
did
in Gonzales v. United States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant
there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut ( the Department's ) recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification ''
, at 412
to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's contention , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it
said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact
United States , 327 U.S. 114 ''
S. , at 412-413
are other contentions which might be considered more difficult
trial , petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the Department's hearing officer , Evensen , as well as his report thereon
claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice
no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose
of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a registrant's file
United States , supra
is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant
regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the registrant's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952
the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney General and , of course , is not the recommendation of the Department
not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice , of which the Attorney General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection
but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board
also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board
petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board
that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file
every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed
to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial
, petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes
are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process
his testimony at trial never developed any such facts
light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's report and notes
says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial
receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its inaccuracy
no such claim is asserted
his present contention on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume
is fully answered by United States v. Nugent , supra
held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection ''
, at 5-6
we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report
of the Department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file , not on an FBI report
in its total context With this enlarged role in mind , I should like to make a few suggestions : What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world
this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context
regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted
is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad
that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation
the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense
also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce
no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments
of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies
be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy
we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action
officer cannot help but be a planning officer
keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present
of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present
is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs
today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control
of course be times for delay and inaction
am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties
hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas -- an affliction of all bureaucracies
to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department
to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome , that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top
no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas
for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank
I would hope that we could pay attention to little things
the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort
only a few examples : The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; ; the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital , can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for
seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world
who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them
hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them
Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas
not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion
expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country
expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can
official operation abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action
of a policy officer It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years , in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government
to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces
practically everybody in this room
will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine
policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the United Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news item read at the breakfast table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et cetera , ad infinitum
officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility
thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign policy , and , if so , what is it
knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer
over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered
has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history
appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions
that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it
already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing
that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog
takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well-established precedents , the commitments of the United States under international charters and treaties , basic statutes , and well-understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers accumulated in the Department
not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted
think about which of these principles must take precedence
know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance
aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem
deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to grasp
think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer
be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government
ambassadors could provide helpful advice
interests sufficiently involved to be consulted
the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved
at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted
is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem
of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself
President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required
action be unilateral or multilateral
matter one for the United Nations or some other international body
if so , the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem
the opinions of mankind What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad
policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it
interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind
given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support
add a caution on this particular point
not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action
first place our business is foreign policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem
emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department of State don't know much about domestic politics ''
an important consideration
sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership
American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership
test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action
, for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals
in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors -- political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative -- to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control
policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels
should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex , there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women
Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project
be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service
cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment
volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States
it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid
principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services
principle should be akin to that of the allowance
volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living
live in modest circumstances , avoiding all conspicuous consumption
they should live with their host country counterparts
health requirements might have to be met
, it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers
Public Health Service , State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized
to the U.S. , volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service , based on the length of time served

part of the government should the Peace Corps be established
of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people
it cuts across party , regional , ethnic and other lines
Corps , therefore , offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development
, the Peace Corps should be administered by a small , new , alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation
reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program , the Peace Corps should be established as an agency in the Department of State
aid operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous , functional unit
the Peace Corps could be physically located in ICA's facilities and depend on the State Department and ICA for administrative support and , when needed , program assistance
way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations

when should the Peace Corps be launched
Corps can either begin in very low gear , with only preparatory work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action , with sufficient funds and made available from existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer
Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost
we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses
in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks , the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall
year or two several thousand might be in service
then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated

the first projects be
first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects
here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest
, however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects
year's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia

the Peace Corps be received abroad
need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation , the readiness to receive such manpower , or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country
skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters
groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility
are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends
important , however , that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community
it to other governments and to the United Nations , we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee
hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands
case , our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as technician helpers in development projects of the U.N. and other international agencies
Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership
must be to learn as much as we teach
Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower
in this spirit , the response and the results will be immeasurably better

it be financed
appropriated funds within the discretion of the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual Security Act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's pilot programs of the Peace Corps
is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds , in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security Act through this new peaceful program , this will be a hopeful sign to the world
then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year
Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive contributions from American businesses , unions , civic organizations and the public at large
must be the project of the whole American people
Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding
also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps , so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus food under P.L. 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel
to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies , universities , international organizations , and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored

worth the cost and the risks
how well conceived and efficiently run , there probably will be failures
be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad
the popular response suggests , the potentiality of the Peace Corps is very great
contribute to the development of critical countries and regions
promote international cooperation and good will toward this country
also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world
of young Americans going to work in developing areas , millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before
and universities carrying a large part of the program , and with students looking toward Peace Corps service , there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness
home , the talks later given by returning members of the Peace Corps , the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world
is meeting the world's need , too , since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world
Corps thus can add a new dimension to America's world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting
said in your State of the Union message , `` The problems are towering and unprecedented -- and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well ''
Congress of the United States : I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower
today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis
Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization
, by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall
Peace Corps is being established under existing authority in the Mutual Security Act and will be located in the Department of State
expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program
world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires
freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , liberated from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and poverty
the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics , and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages , the mountains , the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations
task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools , construct development projects , demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages , and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge
this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations
will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work
help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments , acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice
little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them
resources In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing
fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses
is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972
objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment
habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are : 1
complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources

evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including ( A ) big-game , gamebird , and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands , ( B ) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments , and ( C ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States , other Federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values

and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas

openings , food patches , and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres

miles of fishing streams and 56,000 acres of lakes by stabilizing banks , planting streamside cover , and constructing channel improvements
total adverse impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized
and destroy , retard or prevent reproduction and growth , impair and damage values , and disrupt uses
in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet
were not for the effect of destructive agencies , sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952
percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease , 20 percent to insects , 17 percent to fire , and 18 percent to weather , animals , and various other causes
forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows , and upon the other renewable forest resources
objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services
be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations
to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease
insects and disease In the 10-year period , it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period
require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection
will consist of : 1
present activities through ( A ) quicker , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks ; ; ( B ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage ; ; ( C ) quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic
suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated

present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production
is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed

program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites

pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses
fire It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands , all critical watersheds , and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads
include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection
15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation
levels of protection from fire calls for : 1
modernization , and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards
to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled fire-fighting crews , and equipment use
include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel

use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for suppression of fires while small , and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely

hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas
will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment , and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration , felling snags on 350,000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas , prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres , removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres , and clearing and maintaining 11,000 miles of firebreaks
other damage Rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of the most serious infestations of harmful rodents , such as porcupines and mice , on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands
comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the National Forests
million acres of rangelands and 9.4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period
be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known
trails The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions
is divided into a forest highway system , administered by the Secretary of Commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , administered by the Secretary of Agriculture
these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the National Forests
forest highway system , there are now 24,400 miles of public roads
mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another
of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties , this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed
estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests
forest development road and trail system , there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails
are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests
maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture
estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development roads , and 80,000 miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood , water , forage , and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis
trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection
be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds
or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as : ( A ) the protection of forage , timber , and wildlife resources from fire , insects , and disease ; ; ( B ) the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ; ( C ) the volume of timber that can be marketed , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises ; ; ( D ) the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire , windstorm , insects , and disease ; ; ( E ) the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals
of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible
roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years
these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve
objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services
year 2000 this means servicing ( A ) the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year , ( B ) recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors , ( C ) a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and ( D ) 60 million acres of rangelands
these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails , along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails
miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads
percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year 2000
for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows : 1
construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails
about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities
percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber , but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices

to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period
, land purchase , land use Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular
units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together
others , the previous patenting of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership
boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands , there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership
is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land , or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land
held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands
, which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes , are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ; there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed
this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern States
objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands
tactics of the U.S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history
of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other
forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war
military personnel strength
budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and women in the active forces
to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870,000 men ; ; a Navy of 817 active ships and 619,000 men ; ; a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000 men ; ; and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000 men
reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces
combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers
conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve
requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare
the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve
on the strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped
recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity
proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000 , respectively , to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961
are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives
costs
30% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel
are estimated to be $12.1 billion , an increase of $187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 )
costs are increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel
costs are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961
rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel
military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958
pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates
maintenance
for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be $10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $184 million more than in 1960
stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment
increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential
the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures
arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year
increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up 11% in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15%
, these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces
budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 )
prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives
have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles
if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise
communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air Force , and Federal Aviation Agency
communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise
already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government-owned systems in Alaska , and its early enactment is desirable
research , and construction
45% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs
, these expenditures are estimated at $18.9 billion , compared to $19.3 billion in 1960
, which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices
shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960
authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $4,753 million , which is $1,390 million below that enacted for 1960
other hand , the new authority of $3,825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $581 million higher than for 1960
trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead
of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items
have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known as the Buy American Act
once again that the Congress not reenact this rider
of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress
few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history
systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development
unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems
necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events
in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated
, the importance of the Regulus 2 , a very promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines
is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid-1960's
progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles
high cost of the F-108 system -- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project
other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message
and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans
this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile
of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program
was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers
problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program
result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed
underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology
of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it

deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war
capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier-based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles
capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement
Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability
the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long-range supersonic bomber
, which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier
Atlas ICBM's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first Titan ICBM's next year
solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963
, several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established
the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful
I am recommending that development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines be continued
expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing
time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system
recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52H with the new turbofan engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case
modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers ; ; one B-52 can do the work of several B-47's which it will replace
also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile
coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles also will be procured
will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities , including the classes , types and/or varieties of food grain , the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees accruing from such sale , and other relevant matters

States recognizes the desire of India to accumulate , as quickly as possible , a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal markets for this commodity in India
Agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960
time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 , disposal , India's production , consumption and stocks of food grains , other imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United States , India's storage capacity , and other related factors , any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed which is currently planned for procurement during the first year

Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30 , 1961 , shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 , of the Act at that time

) The Government of India shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , of the Agreement , to disclose the use thereof in the projects and to record the progress of the projects ( including the cost thereof )
and records with respect to each project shall be maintained for the duration of the project , or until the expiration of three years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the United States , whichever is later
Governments shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and all other documents , correspondence , memoranda and other records involving transactions relating to agreed projects
of India shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and services financed under the projects , and shall furnish to the United States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto
delegation leaves within our discretion ( subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided

proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from 540 kc. to 1600 kc.
or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each interferes to some extent with reception of the other
of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day
playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the sunspot cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , atmospheric and manmade noise , and others
existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances
such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g. , power and station separations ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation
of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable
standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B's signal at that point

ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service
fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies
a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere
stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals , at all hours ; ; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity , and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are , in general , negligible
nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere , thereby creating the possibility of one station's rendering service , via skywave , at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal , and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies
the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night

recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions , and vice versa , is not an instantaneous process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise
period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail ; ; during the same period around sunrise , skywave transmission is declining , until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance
in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations , representing an averaging of conditions , and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions
determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset , respectively , should be used for this purpose
the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations
, stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset ( for daytime class 2 , stations ) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 , station where located west of the class 2 , station ( for limited-time class 2 , stations )
restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 , stations operating on regional channels , which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other
to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( figs. 1 and 2 of sec. 3.190 of the rules ) giving average skywave values
were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data
recognized that skywave signals , because of their reflected nature , are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength
reason , the more uncertain skywave service was denominated `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the steadier , more reliable groundwave `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference
6
, the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations
and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation
, as we have stated many times , are -- ( 1 ) To provide some service to all listeners ; ; ( 2 ) To provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible ; ; ( 3 ) To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible
frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others
the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations
frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 , -- A or Class 1 , -- B clear-channel stations , designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and ( at night ) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances , being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective
with these frequencies , the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was predominant ; ; the other objectives were subordinated to it
1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to their 0.1-mv./m. groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference
to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- A operation , and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received ; ; class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv./m. 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference
provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference , only class 1 , stations are capable of rendering skywave service
operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service , interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it

to other frequencies , these are designated as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power
allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible

, the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference
hours , because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it
under our longstanding allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- A ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- A station can render service , interference free , wherever it can be received
remainder of the clear channels , the dominant ( class 1 ) -- B stations are protected as described above , and the relatively small number of secondary ( class 2 ) ) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate directionally and/or with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 , stations
daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels
2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities
daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them
on the regional channels many class 3 , stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power

the question presented for decision in the present Daytime Skywave proceeding is whether our decision ( in 1938-1939 ) to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset , is sound as a basis for AM allocations , or whether , in the light of later developments and new understanding , skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account , and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours
of the proceeding 10
reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof
, there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena
, affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference

or two-season hunt , of which there have been too many recently , may do more harm than good ; ; for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued ; ; and they are dashed , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit
making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time
group of the Foundation's advisors are , at any one period of time , the members of our Advisory Board , consisting , now , of thirty-six men and women
chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts
in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees' minds
concept of an Advisory Board , ancillary to the Board of Trustees , we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University , A. Lawrence Lowell , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration
had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr. Lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been , it may be said truly , pretty uniformly good
in accordance with Mr. Lowell's concept of an advisory board , our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices
we should become too consistent , in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts , the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains a trickle -- not a flow
new members through the Advisory Board
of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection -- one for the selection of Fellows from Canada , the United States , and the English-speaking Caribbean area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American republics and the Republic of the Philippines
members of our Advisory Board , and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection , the Foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of Fellows
, as we know , utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get ; ; and quality of advice , added to devotion to the Foundation's purposes and ideals , we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day
facts about our Advisory Board and its members' duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and imaginative , on which to base our selections of Fellows
, the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , formally , members of that Board
besides , there are a large number of scholars , artists , composers of music , novelists , poets , essayists , choreographers , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience
, the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks : to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are
a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management
is true of every foundation
biennium reviewed in this Report , our Board of Trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class administration of the Foundation's affairs : Dr. James Brown Fisk , physicist , President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , was elected to the Board of Trustees
a member both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society ; ; and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions
N. Ray , Provost , Vice-President and Professor of English in the University of Illinois , was appointed Associate Secretary General
of the Foundation appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the latter's eventual retirement
is a Fellow of the Foundation -- appointed thrice to assist his studies of William Makepeace Thackeray and of H. G. Wells -- and , before his appointment to the Foundation's executive staff , had been given our highest scholarly accolade , appointment to the Advisory Board
to the Foundation's officers , Dr. James F. Mathias , for eleven years our discerning colleague as Associate Secretary , was promoted to be Secretary
a historian , with the great merit of a historian's long view
to the Foundation's staff , as Assistant Secretary , is Mr. J. Kellum Smith , Jr.
, like the present Secretary General , is a lawyer ; ; and lawyers -- with the great virtues that they are trained to read `` the fine print '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are indispensable even in a foundation office
Secretary General has been the Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago
he will not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are , quite simply , made to assure qualitative continuity in the Foundation's policies and practices
recognition of excellence and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year
not given to lamentations , neither personally nor in these Reports
contrary , if this be an apocalyptic era as is commonly said , we see it as an era of opportunity
granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ; and by their demanding tend to create resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth
, examples are legion : Pericles speaking his funeral oration in Ancient Greece's extremity after Thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom ; ; Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution ; ; Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount , close to his ultimate sacrifice ; ; Shakespeare speaking with `` the indescribable gusto of the Elizabethan voice '' -- ; ; Keats's words -- in the days of the Spanish Armada's threats ; ; Isaac Newton , at the age of twenty-three , industriously calculating logarithms `` to two and fifty places '' during the great plague year in England , 1665 ; ; Winston Churchill's Olympian , optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago ; ; the present-day explorations of outer space , answering age-old questions of science and philosophy , in the face of possible wars of extinction
haec olim meminisse iuvabit , as the Roman poet , Virgil , declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today
, indeed , cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced ; ; and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind
, out of the social evils of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens ; ; and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men -- until today -- , in the industrialized West , these social evils substantially do not exist
were not arrived at by any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business
educated men , who , as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying , formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility
, to put it realistically , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected
they made naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use Marx's word -- more than a subsistence wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the result , in turn , that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase
all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ; indeed , the contrary has happened
between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has narrowed , in the industrialized Western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable
reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity
say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ; and even putting it that way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong
Sumner Maine , a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with , wrote his brilliant legal generalization , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract ''
of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do
the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice
the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ; the greater the range of choice , the greater the rate of change
is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future
there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress
truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart
anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report , let me enlighten them with the truths that , under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , untrammeled in every way , toward their discoveries , their creative efforts for the good of mankind
year 1959 , we granted 354 Fellowships ; ; in 1960 , we granted 334
, our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts
not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all scholarly and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation does
if pressed , we would say what the late Robert Henri , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that counts ''
we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the humanities , the creative arts
no part in such discussions , because we think them largely futile ; ; and we think them largely futile because , for true excellence of accomplishment , every scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view
Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world
history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology
Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830
early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and watchmaker , as he plied his trade
age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott & Harris in Valley Falls , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation , he went into business for himself in 1831 , making lathes and small tools
led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 , under the name D. Brown & Son , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe
of Joseph's partnership with his father were numbered
, a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years
continued in business by himself , quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world
his genius , of course , sprang from his familiarity with clock movements
early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young man's occupation
particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period
business also grew , and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire
have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , 1848 , Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book , in his characteristically cryptic style , `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice ''
apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown , for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ; the company became `` J. R. Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development
arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time
, the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts
significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine
, in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index drilling , and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement
careers , both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades
were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today
development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture
, the partnership began manufacturing the Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine
story goes , Mr. Gibbs , who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine
to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , enabling the crude machine to take stitches
showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the Howe sewing machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine , which was unknown to him in detail , used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one
invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture
work was a boon to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment
screw machine , now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine , takes its ancestry directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine
made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret , by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock , and reversible tap and die holders
, Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist drills
time , during the Civil War , Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files
neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation
of this problem was Mr. Brown's famous Serial No. 1 Universal Milling Machine , the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type milling machine used throughout the world
machine , bearing its famous serial number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence
Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter , a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics
that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one sharpening
as the time came for re-sharpening , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made
made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form
invention achieved this and , as a byproduct , formed the cornerstone of Brown & Sharpe's position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the 1920's when superceded by other methods
caliper , as a common workshop tool , also owes much to J. R. Brown
Brown was not himself its inventor ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use
was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day
achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine
was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition
, like its milling counterpart , was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world
J. R. Brown's other major developments , the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come
Brown's death , there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company
man was Samuel Darling
of the firm Darling & Swartz , Mr. Darling began by challenging Brown & Sharpe to its keenest competition during the 1850's and early 60's
, however , a truce was called between the companies , and the partnership of Darling , Brown & Sharpe was formed
year and the buying out of Mr. Darling's interest in 1892 , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark
outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale , whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown , and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture gages , and therefore its products , with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world
on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr. Richmond Viall , Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910
possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men
an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company
sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad
the death of Lucian Sharpe in 1899 , the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company
presidency , the company's physical plant was enormously expanded , and the length and breadth of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world
early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world
years the company's product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown
from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines
grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders , surface grinders , and a wide variety of special and semi-special models
, Henry D. Sharpe , Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business
is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts
Tool Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and bed-type milling machines
is the Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development
Industrial Products Division , the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment , machinists' tools -- including micrometers , Vernier calipers , and accessories
Cutting Tool Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters , end mills and saws
net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959
was $2,557,111 , or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $2,323,867 or $2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares
other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960
was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development
of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959
current year Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960
the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961
sound tax policy In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next few years
depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange
development Our research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona
is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money
involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment , in terms of efficiency and versatility
important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine
On this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's future growth in sales and earnings
this necessary increase in research and development , though properly chargeable to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years
machines In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines
produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics
past year , great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics
are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and blouses made from these fabrics
, operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute , is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today
yarn directly from the producers' largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics
Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers' mills
the year , additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns
are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn packages , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn
believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment
activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine
is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year
was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry
market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder
has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ; it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted
bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality
have already placed firm orders for this machine
application A new application for the Unifil loom winder , running single filling for box looms , will broaden mill use of this equipment
A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns
equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed
machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute
equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time
machines and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high polymer yarns , in several fiber producing plants
forward to a stronger position in this expanding field
We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction
research Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells
of our exclusive American licensee , Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation , has been important in this work
to its major effort on fuel cells , Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account
currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs
recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil ( CSF ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials
gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States
will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country
a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military
, we believe , will develop important commercial applications
for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases
initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity
advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation
is to keep abreast of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities
facilities Early in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations
well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year
now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick
the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962
sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover
will contain 430,000 square feet , approximately the same as our present plant
its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs
consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force
entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant
During the year our British subsidiary , Leesona-Holt , Limited , expanded its plant in Darwen , England , and added machine tool capacity
of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood
equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis
available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations
, land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future
The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction
be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island , a non-profit organization , which will reimburse us for the cost of construction
then occupy the new plant under lease , with an option to purchase
are , in our opinion , very favorable to Leesona
of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank
to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt , Limited
that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment
loans have been reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000
$625,561 to $8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months
enter 1961 in a strong financial position
In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of Machinists , AFL-CIO , wages of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May , 1960 , and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately
, Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations
In addition to direct salaries and wages , the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees : During the pension year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan
13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan , totaled $2,412,616
market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago
factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living
many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years
In textiles , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity
designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery , Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility
shifting styles The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration
be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly
, production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics , as well as blends

months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future
, despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole
in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle
has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level
electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets
in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959
value of our industry's shipments , at factory prices , increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement
a further gain is in prospect for 1961
sales up Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion , compared to $1.7 billion in 1959
TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ; set production ( excluding those destined for the export market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic
year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959 ; ; however , production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million
to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million ( excluding export )
and auto radios were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ; sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units
production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959
also had a good year , reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market
for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods
expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will
for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 - 15.5 million sets
believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959
to grow 1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 1959
interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance
been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability
may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions
items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs , strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command , and improved battlefield surveillance systems
development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially
development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963
, the realm of space technology will show substantial gains ; ; it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20%
defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962
impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least $6 billion
equipment Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959
for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually , reaching some $450 million in 1960
look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960's , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing , industrial process control , and information storage and retrieval
industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright
near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ; sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach $1.9 billion
In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year
now a $1.0 billion business , up from $0.9 billion in 1959 , and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961
for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry
parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates
military field , incoming orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components
transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million , compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types
about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961
passive components , such as capacitors and resistors , although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961
, I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally
have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ; on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ; and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's
of Gilbert B. Devey as General Manager of VecTrol Engineering , Inc. , of Stamford , Connecticut , a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls , has been announced by David B. Peck , Vice President , Special Products
will be responsible for the commercial expansion of VecTrol's line of electronic and electrical power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers , working closely with Walter J. Brown , President and Director of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary
will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol's custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff
new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of Sprague's Special Products Group , which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components , packaged component assemblies , and high temperature magnet wires
first came to Sprague in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department , coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington , D. C. , where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies
War 2 , , he was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy

a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers
a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , London , a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio , and a chartered electrical engineer in Great Britain
of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough , Manager of Interference Control Field Service
was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems
he helps the president keep track of delegated matters
duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs
see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course
believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship
expects faculty members to remember , in exercising their autonomy , that they share no collective responsibility for the university's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions
welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration
do faculty members govern themselves
little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government
pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government
too , need to learn to delegate
administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention
insist on governing themselves , they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government
, nevertheless , several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege
, for example , present significant university-wide issues to the senate
encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty ; ; by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ; by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration ; ; by minimizing the number of committees
many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , complaints of a lack of communication persist
is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose
president , conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is
for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation
faculty influence and decrease tension , many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly
has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas , he can open the way for innovation , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take
require tact , sensitivity to faculty prerogatives , patience , and persistence
task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands
do not automatically reproduce themselves
form an important bridge between the president and the faculty
not only as spokesmen for their areas , but they also contribute to top-level decision making
who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance
depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration
at the same time , looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments
that this can be done , other than by hiring new high-priced professors , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance
of a president's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty
the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards , the president can encourage faculty leadership
can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to
dean should take a direct , long-term interest in faculty development
dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs , plans for the future , qualifications of those on the job , and bright prospects elsewhere
maintenance of a long-term program , the departments , and particularly their chairmen , are strategic
and nominate candidates for appointment and promotion
an independent judgment for the president , the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly
colleges and universities , a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates
members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma
be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work
university , the president cites the faculty review committee as `` a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty ''
president recommends a candidate to the trustees , the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere
or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind
way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered , although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria
passing over quiet , unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments
certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly
personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure , to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements
can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different
, the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale
rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution , the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action
university , like most successful marriages , is a unity of diversities Without forcing all components into a single pattern , the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level , which a university -- in contrast to a multiversity -- should stand for
and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals
a few more institutions are deciding such questions as : Shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates
we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subjects
first instance , adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned
second , more shops , laboratories , and staff will be required
president , a master plan looking ahead five years ( the maximum reach for sound forecasting ) , offers several practical advantages
faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards
and equipment can be efficiently developed
programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present and future financial fitness
one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts
confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and to achieve them

has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres
of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses ( e.g. , Garstung , 1958 )
accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon
the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface
of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets
intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity , although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600-degrees
suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet , although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence
case of Jupiter , the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator , and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components
remaining planets , only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources , and not very much information is available
been observed twice at about 3-cm wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars
intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations , but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin
to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity
of this , the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years
of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 1.25-cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer ( 1946 )
followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 )
from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion ; ; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson ( 1930 ) and Pettit ( 1935 ) ; ; and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-1/2 days after Full Moon , which is again in contrast to the infrared emission , which reaches its maximum at Full Moon
Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves , although opaque to infrared radiation
emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon , while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface , where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase
absorption of radio waves in rocklike material varies with wave length , it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material
emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 , when Burke and Franklin ( 1955 ) identified the origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from Jupiter
type of planetary radiation is discussed by Burke ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet ( chap. 14 )
which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm , and from Mars and Jupiter at 3.15 cm in 1956 ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 , A , B , C ) , and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 ( Drake and Ewen , 1958 )
relatively short time since these early observations , Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm , and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 Aj
characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity , the polarization , and the direction of arrival of the waves
angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc
much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved
be possible , however , to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers
polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth
been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation
made with the NRL 50-foot reflector , which is altitude-azimuth-mounted , would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized
measurements ( Radhakrishnan and Roberts , 1960 ) have shown the 960-mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk
this very significant result , most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation
of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets
radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet
black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation
of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material
radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths , except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise
level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1-degree
wave lengths an increase of the order of 10-degrees in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected
neglecting the extreme outbursts , reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length range

2.1 observations Radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 mm to 75 cm , and the results are summarized in Table 1
also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; ; see also chap. 11 )
the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data , and this , together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers , must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures
observations at 4.3 mm ( Coates , 1959 ) , the diameter of the antenna beam , 6'.7 , was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface , and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases
indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions
seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it
diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude
, observations have been made at 8-mm wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2' ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 )
contours are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm by Coates ( 1959 ) and apparently the emission at 8 mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features
observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted
of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described
3.15 cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 to June 19 , 1956 , using the 50-foot reflector at the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington
diameter of the antenna beam was about 9' , and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes
patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known
of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam ( assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram , to be 0.85
brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon's disk is nearly uniform
of the observations is Af where the phase angle , Q , is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors
is plotted along with the 8.6-mm observations of Gibson ( 1958 ) in figure 1 , A
in the 3-cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much less than the variation in the 8.6-mm emission , as would be expected from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 )
discussion which follows , the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component , and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component
observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20 , 1958 , using the 84-foot reflector at the Maryland Point Observatory of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory
of the moon was about 2 days
diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18'.5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon
were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon )
the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc
shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the total arc energy
energy balance of the anode was established
ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount
of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Aj
were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities
high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation
requirements are particularly severe at the anode
electric arcs , for instance , approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of Af as measured by the authors -- the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere
generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode
heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs
generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat
transfer to the anode is due to the following effects : 1
condensation ( work function ) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode
transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath

by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column
transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up Af
has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker ( Ref. 1 )
gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode )
the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point
apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode
flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions ; ; however , the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux
to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must , therefore , aim at a reduction of the anode loss
possibilities exist for achieving this : 1
of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output

of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces

the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode
method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers ( Ref. 2 )
of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage
through a porous anode ( transpiration cooling ) not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes , but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself
study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper
used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction
material was porous graphite
metals should be usable in principle
technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots
arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs
direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ( Ref. 3 )
Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder
consisted of a 1/4'' '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water cooled copper tube
could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing
in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk
gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below
air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2
also blown at low velocities ( mass flow rate Af ) through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air
consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite plug , 1/4 inch long
was National Carbon NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30
pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode
plug ( Figure 2 ) was inserted into a carbon anode holder
thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas
exposed to a high velocity gas jet
and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts
had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection
shown in figure 1 and 2 ( Pyrometer Instrument Co. Model 95 ) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder
were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature
holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3
design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant
heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc , a carbon shield was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1/16 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder
, the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation
the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug
flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator
source was a commercial D. C. rectifier
Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load
was regulated by means of a variable resistor and measured with a 50 mV shunt and millivoltmeter
voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders
the falling characteristic of the rectifier , no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation
frequency starter was used to start the arc
and error analysis 1
anode with carbon anode holder The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind
losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made
to reduce the number of variable parameters , all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5'' '' and a current of 100 Aj
flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between Af and Af
limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable
limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature ( see below ) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc
which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously
mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured
the surface temperature of the anode plug , the surface was scanned with a pyrometer
turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug
was denoted by Af
of this hot region was estimated by eye
of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug
temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug
denoted by Af
temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : Af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot
equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon , the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation Af whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as Af
results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures
gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure 2 was Af
values are listed in Table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages
the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2
these temperatures are plotted in figure 4
no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements
the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates
in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of Af
was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned
sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder , to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements
of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry
heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts
calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af
heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby Af
distribution of figure 4 gives Af for all blowing rates , assuming Af
dependent value of **ye was taken from Ref. 7
loss from the anode surface was computed according to Af where Af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures Af and Af calculated analogously to equation ( 1 )
viscometer is shown in Figure 2
of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims
a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed
of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks
use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks
has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded
use of various weights , data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained
used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described
test a Af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of Af with a clearance of 0.002'' '' on each side of the tape
a rate of shear of Af
however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs
of one block contained a hole 1/16'' '' in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure
were only four fluids tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types
the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure when undergoing shear , and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two
shows the data on a silicone fluid , labeled 12,500 cps which gave a high positive normal pressure
tape was run for over 1 hr. , a steady state was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate
had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time
pressure was then introduced , and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater , the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure
method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of polybutene ( molecular weight reported to be 770 ) was over half an atmosphere
pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand
fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300
fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight
suction was 3.25'' '' of test fluid measured from the top of the block , and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids
presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly , since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus
pressure is not explained by the velocity head Af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes
can be considered exploratory only
they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper
give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures
instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies
is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials
instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks , paints , adhesives , molten plastics , and bread dough , for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed `` length '' , `` shortness '' , `` spinnability '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods at present
change Af caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head
volume is the molal volume , then Af is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists
Af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure , it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects
shear field with a height of H and a cross-sectional area of A opposed by a manometer with a height of H ( referred to the same base as H ) and a cross-sectional area of A
is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and **yr is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is Af
the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to H
volume of the system above the reference height is Af , and H can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of H
total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero
Af , which is the pressure
interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium
can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields
between osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way
above development we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium ( referred to by some as thermostatics ) to the steady state
be justified thermodynamically in this case , and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared
an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff that `` the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions ''
one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar
mechanics are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar
of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear
birefringence studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear , and as the rate of shear increases , the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear
Philippoff , the recoverable shear S is given by Af where **yc is the angle of extinction
and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the Af calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face
another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature , and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields
are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands
appear to be ellipsoids , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are
are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation
of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids
Taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45-degrees at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear
suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup
is , of course , a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies
forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop
) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions
) The kinetic effects are negligible
) Since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field , it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid
reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear
the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is Af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is Af , the pressure exerted by any curved surface is Af , where **yg is the interfacial tension and Af and Af are the two radii of curvature
is given by Rumscheidt and Mason
is the major axis of an ellipsoid and B and C are the other two axes , the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis Af , and the difference in pressure along the A and B axes is Af
no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas
there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate ( viscosity 155 poises ) suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper by Mason and Bartok
of the material in the drops is , of course , not negligible
the photograph in this paper give Af at the maximum rate of shear of Af
is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of cosec Af applies , the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis , and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated
was Af from the above data
to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops
appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation
energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume
words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink
that work equals Q which in turn equals Af
a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that Af , where **zq is the probability that state ( i.e. , volume for an ideal gas ) could be reached by chance alone
known as conformational entropy
entropy is , in this case , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes or other energies involved
though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy , the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure
for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings
magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented
paramagnetic , and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening
are asymmetric and over the range of field Af gauss and temperature Af the asymmetry increases with increasing Af and decreasing T
resonance shift of Af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction
theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment Af of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to Af
predicts a linear dependence of Af on Af , where J is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss constant
second moment Af conforms to the relation Af in agreement with theory
the electron paramagnetic effects ( slope ) can be separated from the nuclear effects ( intercept )
dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes
dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei , but the symmetry of the Af bond in Af remains in doubt
magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei
important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure
to be well suited for the study of these matters , since it is a normal paramagnet , with three unpaired electrons on the chromium , its crystal structure is very simple , and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong Af bond provides structural interest
discuss the Af bond in Af
outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment
is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects
provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the Af bond in Af
in Af Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the Af bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid
it will be asymmetric until a certain critical Af distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric
ample evidence from many sources that the Af bond in Af is symmetric
distance in Af is 2.26 Aj
evidence , though less convincing than for Af , that the Af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric
Af distance is 2.44 Aj
of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the Af bond becomes symmetric when the Af bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 A , but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric Af bonds
studied the crystal structure of Af by x-ray diffraction
the structure contains an Af bond with the Af distance of Af
, then , the possibility that this Af bond is symmetric , although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data
Af to be trigonal , Laue symmetry Af , with Af , Af
experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of Af
data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group , but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry
assumption the space group must be Af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell

group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric
powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for Af
lead to a structure in which sheets of Cr atoms lie between two sheets of O atoms
atoms in each sheet are close packed and each Cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of O atoms
layers are stacked normal to the ( 111 ) axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer , in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers
layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds
of the structure is to be found in reference 6
details of the structure appear reasonable
appears to be unique among OOH compounds , but is the same as that assumed by Af
angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal
the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off Af , but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent , with Af at Af and Af at Af ( space group Af ) , where Af represents the oxygens on one side of the Af layers and Af those on the other side
any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short Af interlayer distance of 2.55 A or the non-hydrogen-bonded Af interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 Aj
is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence
effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general , rather than special , positions along the ( 111 ) axis
Af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheets ; ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet , but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other ; ; ( 3 ) hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way , so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms
2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural grounds
of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell , for which no evidence exists
the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 )
samples Douglass prepared his sample of Af by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at 300 - 325-degrees-C
was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material
proved to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample
we learned from Douglass that his sample contained a few percent Af impurity
is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated Af would be suspect
another preparation of Af which we used here
of 1M aqueous Af with 1 Af added are heated in a bomb at 170-degrees-C for 48 hours
fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation , and dried at 110-degrees-C )
analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340-degrees-C and a large endothermic reaction at 470-degrees-C
reaction is in accord with the reported decomposition of Af
showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337-degrees-C and another weight loss of 10.8% at 463-degrees-C
weight loss for Af going to Af and Af is 10.6%
analysis of gases evolved upon heating to 410-degrees-C indicated nitrogen oxides and water vapor
reaction occurring at 337-degrees-C is probably caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates , and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than Af
measurements were made on material which had been heated to 375-degrees-C for one hour
indicated Af calcium and all other impurities much lower
gave 58.8% Cr as compared with 61.2% theory
Af adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss
diffraction pattern of the material , taken with CuK**ya radiation , indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass
by R. G. Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities
found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of Af , where Af
three unpaired electrons the coefficient would be 3.10
spectrum , obtained by H. A. Benesi and R. G. Snyder of this laboratory , showed bands in the positions found by Jones
examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3M in diameter
appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this
data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater
no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination
resonance ( NMR ) measurements The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing a Varian model Af broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch electromagnet system
at 40 Mc/sec was obtained with the Varian model Af unit
type of bridge was used in the 10 - 16 Mc/sec range
power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects
frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was used
were obtained in all cases
was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal
value of the thermal relaxation time Af at room temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method
of Af estimated at 470 gauss was Af microseconds
measurement of the spin - spin relaxation time Af was obtained at 10 Mc/sec by pulse methods
was obtained by W. Blumberg of the University of California , Berkeley , by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal
derived was 16 microseconds
were derived from the mean value of the resonance line , defined as the field about which the first moment is zero
of the spectra were computed by numerical integration
applied for modulation broadening , apparatus background , and field shift
obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294-degrees-K
low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades
was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour )
, which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375-degrees-C , showed the presence of adsorbed water ( about 0.3 wt ) ) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared , due to broadening , at low temperature
reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375-degrees-C which contain no adsorbed water
powder density of the Af used here was about Af , approximately one-third that of the crystal density ( Af )
density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about Af
obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio of 4 : : 1
of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical
also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube
was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary
also obtained from a third sample of Af which had been diluted to three times its original volume with powdered , anhydrous alundum ( Af )
was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above
renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive , and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited
today for detergent builders is quite diverse
known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent formulations for household use
advertised products , which are used primarily for washing clothes , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives ( sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates ) and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate
household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ; light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ; and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised
entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder/active ratio
in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products : ( 1 ) the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork
quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders
, many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate , which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products
powders now also contain phosphates
cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28
process Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces
involves an aqueous medium , a solid substrate , soil to be removed , and the detergent or surface-active material
differentiation between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved
of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of Af
, a metal coupon Af in size would have a magnitude from 100,000 to a million less
there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity
a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal , depending upon surface roughness
considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning
esthetic values , such as high- or low-foam level , perfume content , etc. , the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high
how they are formulated , a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application , since they do not give adequate soil removal
best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation
formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings ; ; whereas , with a poor formulation , the clothes exhibit a build-up of `` tattle-tale grey '' and dirty spots -- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash
washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents
indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics
are several laboratory wash procedures in general use
fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash
way , numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance ( whiteness ) of the cloth swatches before and after washing
is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones
the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high
of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice
of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex
cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active
when the proper inorganic constituents are employed , practically any wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation
orthophosphates , borates , carbonates , and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners
, the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else
of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers
of washing Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces
of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : 1
which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties

, which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats ( esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids )

which include the wide variety of nonparticulate materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object

, which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue
on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent
a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of Van der Waal's forces
a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles , or to stick to an uncharged surface
if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or , if one kind is charged and the other kind is not , the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced
a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa , and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge
, dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids , including liquid greases
stains , and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface
cases , these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action
essentially static system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent
process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts , to some extent , as a dissolving and solvating agent
are hardly removed by washing in plain water ; ; and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove
detergents are used
active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils
constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils
well known , detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution
of anionic surfactants , including the soaps , have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration
) Below the critical micelle concentration , monomers and some dimers are present
) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80
) For anionics , these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups ( the ionized ends ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase
( oleophilic ) substances such as greases , oils , or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase
imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold
matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process
micelle formation is the technologically important ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil - water interfaces in such a manner that the polar ( or ionized ) end of the molecule is directed towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase
cleaning process , sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant
washing , the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass , with the aid of mechanical action , and enter the aqueous phase
a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil
than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases
particularly true of highly charged ions , especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes
usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil - water interfaces , the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure ( see Table 26-2 on p. 1678 )
for aqueous media , we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent , and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent
equilibrium sorption data which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt ( especially clay soils ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge
particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface , which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions
charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase
is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency
not consider the kinetic effects of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will be discussed later ( see pp. 1746 - 1748 )
picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as : Af
of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale
must be dispersed and protected against flocculation
must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil
evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe
of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process , it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituents having `` synergistic '' properties has gained widespread acceptance
over-all process , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation ; ; and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active
exchange of chlorine between Af and liquid Af is readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180-degrees and above
exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees using light absorbed only by the Af
gas phase , with Af of Af and Af of Af , quantum yields of the order of Af have been observed at 85-degrees
attempts to obtain highly pure reagents , serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction
possible to set a lower limit of about Af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form Af radical
of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions
of the simplicity of the molecules , isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data
appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals , as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond
of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies
be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid
be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine
the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high ; ; also it would be expected that Af would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for Af radicals
these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish , even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents
reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride

highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a tube of resublimed Af into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed with liquid air
then distilled at least three times from a trap at -78-degrees to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation
product was stored at -78-degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal
methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine , the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory
the latter , silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing Af obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of Af which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line
chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place
was stored at -78-degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal
of Mallinckrodt , low sulfur , reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated with Af and Af and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches
was then extracted with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was distilled on a Vigreux column , a 25% center cut being retained which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of Af
chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal
tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off
amount of carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line
amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off
of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking , redistributed to the reaction tubes , frozen down , and each tube was then sealed off
for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off
in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set
and analysis
samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long
few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness
of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220-degrees
reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing , 5.5 cm. long , diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces
were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride
cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window
of light source were used , a thousand watt projection lamp and an AH6 high pressure mercury arc
was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell
light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system
intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell
the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous sodium iodide solution
was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated ( cells containing gaseous reactants were immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide )
of the liberated Af with Af , aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a solution-type Geiger tube
liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments after emptying
of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts / minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts / minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride , empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of Af in Af and Af
thermal reaction
studying the liquid phase thermal reaction , some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared and analyzed
done at 180 , 200 , 210 , and 220-degrees
of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent , a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine , to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes
to the method described in the section above , chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a Af eutectic on the vacuum line , and by exchange of Af with molten Af
was substituted for Af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride
between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found
rates observed at 200-degrees ranged from Af of the chlorine exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour
cases the chlorine concentration was about Af
reaction tubes containing 0.2 of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another , both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine exchanged per hour
reaction was found at room temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours
phase photochemical reaction
phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange , although still erratic
was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold
differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings
reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to 85-degrees in a further endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity
cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination
reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging from 11 to 18 Af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases
possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine , and considering the spectral distribution of the light source
indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65-degrees is of the order of magnitude of unity
reaction cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated , chlorine and phosgene were produced
also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af
exchange in the gas phase
there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects , the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate
such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table 1
series 1 , the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm.
column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 ( 14.7 cm. distance ) calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity
of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 , where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen
effect ( Robertson , 1937 ; ; Wyatt and Whipple , 1950 ) , which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation , causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth
velocity varies inversely as the particle size -- a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years
1955 ) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure , which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag
the corpuscular radiation , i.e. , the solar-wind protons , must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size , with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force
effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis , with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun
planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached
astronomical unit from the sun ( the Earth's distance ) the dust orbits are probably nearly circular
is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth
( 1955 ) has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson effect , which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi-major axis
can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth
is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects , there must be a continual replenishment : otherwise , micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space
several possible sources
Whipple ( 1955 ) , cometary debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the sun , maintaining a fairly steady state
are also thought to contribute material
also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon
measurements of micrometeorite flux One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space
the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude
discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved
few million kilometers from the Earth , but still in the region of the Earth's orbit , a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable
distances from the sun , the situation is still less certain
several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment
has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors
, the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain
brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light , an estimate of the particle sizes , concentrations , and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane
source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component
of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category
provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth
evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the Earth is obtained from piezoelectric sensors ( essentially microphones ) and from wire gages ; ; these instruments are installed on rockets , satellites , and space probes
the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer 1 ) , 1958 Delta 2 ( Sputnik 3 ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 )
, with large sensitive areas , have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure
vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information
rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; ; this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of Af
show daily and diurnal variations
cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon , and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude
conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth's orbit
been contradictory reports from 1958 Delta 2 , and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable
15 , a very large increase occurred with Af of mass between Af and Af ; ; for the next two days , the impact rate was Af ; ; and for the next nine days , the impact rate was less than Af ( Nazarova , 1960 )
for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux
from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of Af for masses larger than Af for about 1000 events in a 22-day period ( LaGow and Alexander , 1960 )
rate varied by less than a factor of 4.5
have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations
the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large
assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements , a mass-distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius to the inverse 7/2 power of the radius
have yielded little information
, recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours
sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts , the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones
on so few events , these results are of dubious validity
of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain
believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities
one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship
United States , most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces
experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor
ejection '' momentum is linearly related to the particle energy
about the same mass threshold as that of the U.S. apparatus , but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater
a difference in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S. microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments are isolated from the skin
mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of Af in the U.S. work and Af in the U.S.S.R. work
mass of about Af corresponds to a 10-M-diameter sphere of density Af
the conversion from mass to size is unreliable , since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as Af
extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown
value used is also open to some question ; ; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth , only about one third the above-mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass
and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors
variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity
of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data
of meteorite data , prepared by Whipple ( 1958 ) on the basis of photographic , visual , and radar evidence , is given in Table 5-1
estimated mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude
is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density Af except for the smallest particles , which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure
values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors
assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude , in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant
agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta
in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent shielding by the Earth ; ; hence , these figures apply immediately above the Earth's atmosphere
flux is given in the last column ; ; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the Earth
, if there is a dust blanket around the Earth , the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here
the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used ; ; for example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a Af , zero-magnitude meteorite
scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light
scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite , permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known ( Cook and Whipple , 1958 )
distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude ( Manning and Eshleman , 1959 )
this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites
equation is Af , where N is the number of Af with electron line-density greater than or equal to Af , and Q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite
N is inversely proportional to the radius cubed and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data
fifteenth magnitude , Af , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude , Af
fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple's table
may be in error for several reasons
data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region
and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns
it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected

of micrometeorite flux A measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions ( Pettersson , 1960 )
material , by the time it reaches the Earth's surface , has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere
meteorites , the average nickel content is about 2.5 per cent
much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx
indicate an accretion of about Af tons per year over the entire globe , or about Af
Biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man
the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems
also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals
is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon
reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect
period of infectious disease , plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect , render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter
can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases
an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities
operational procedure in BW for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area
has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials , the pathogenesis of respiratory infections , the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence
and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years
equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics
has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques
the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures
instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms
of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated
anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract , such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi , are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence
particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs
is highly susceptible to infection
and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation
between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in Table 1
BW defense , it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect
, bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air
optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne
inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface
rise during lapse conditions
, of course , certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met
properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract , are noteworthy in defense considerations
the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out
of such small particles , moreover , diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas
be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens , restaurants , food stores , hospitals , etc.
the organism , there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products , i.e. , in milk for example
consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense
the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials : In the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological conditions
sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were disseminated
fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment
and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 miles
describes the results obtained in this trial
traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles
dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was covered
could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case
of a biological aerosol , on a much smaller scale , is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism
suspension of the spores of B. subtilis , var. niger , generally known as Bacillus globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles
cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns
test , 130 gallons of a suspension , having a count of Af organisms per ml , or a total of approximately Af spores , was aerosolized
operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval vessel , cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze
along a two-mile course
was started at 5:00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes
a slight lapse condition , a moderate fog , and 100 per cent relative humidity
of sampling stations had been set up on shore
located at the homes of Government employees , in Government Offices , buildings and reservations within the trial area
attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors of a Government office building
were operated for a period of two hours except one , which was operated for four hours
instance , there was a dosage of 562 during the first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period , a four-fold increase
that the sampling period , particularly at the more distant locations , should have been increased
be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol
distance sampled was 23 miles from the source
be seen from these dosage isopleths , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area sampled
quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly downwind
in the three levels of the vertical profile were : Af
not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol
of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry
have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal
, for example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os
instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure , making diagnosis difficult
produced by aerosol exposure , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of `` rabbit fever '' on a finger
would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious
are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category
would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements
, obviously , a proper goal of research to improve on this property
connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction
it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable
would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population
immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized
be remembered , however , that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent
a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made
might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism , a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality
possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains
also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification
these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management
are , of course , highly host-specific
not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives
be of overriding importance in considering military objectives
of epidemic disease merits some discussion
limited effort has been devoted to this problem
those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics
point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics , it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated
further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease
why this approach to BW defense has not been given major attention
problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target
of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease
example will illustrate this point
assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus ( Rickettsia prowazwki ) over City A and that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom
was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City A was not lousy
a prerequisite for epidemic typhus
case , then , the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack
done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic
other hand , a similar attack might have been made on City B whose population was known to be lousy
expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack
defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices
be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons
delivery vehicles -- whether they be airplanes , submarines or guided missiles -- should be usable
is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city , it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city
are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense
obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned
conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack
rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed , precooked and even predigested foods
an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage
include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products
are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack
of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies
low-temperature ethanol ( Cohn ) fractionation , electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses
the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators
Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose
coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Aj
Morrison used a single , continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti-A and anti-B agglutinins from preisolated **yg-globulin samples
present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described
methods samples
were obtained from normal group A , group B and group O donors
the anti-Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals
complete antibody and had a titer of 1 : 512 in saline
contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1 : 256 in albumin and 1 : 2048 by the indirect Coombs test
, containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies , had titers of 1 : 256 in saline , 1 : 512 in albumin and 1 : 1024 by the indirect Coombs test
one serum was obtained from a donor ( R. E. ) who had been sensitized 6 years previously
exhibited titers of 1 : 16 in albumin and 1 : 256 by the indirect Coombs test
titers were determined by reaction with homozygous Af red cells

anti-B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods
of each sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group Af or group B red cells in a small Af test tube
instances group O cells were also used as controls
cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use
of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 Aj
were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined macroscopically for agglutination
albumin method , equal volumes of 30% bovine albumin , sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 Aj
were tested by both the saline and albumin methods
of fractions of sera containing Rh antibodies were tested by the saline , albumin and indirect Coombs techniques
heterozygous Af cells , Af and homozygous and heterozygous Af cells were used to test each sample ; ; however , in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous Af and homozygous Af cells will be presented here
and albumin tests were performed as described for the ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37-degrees-C before centrifugation
tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner
were washed three times with saline , anti-human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination
sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits
shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the `` broad spectrum '' type were selected for use in the present study
cells for the Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the Af cells , which had been glycerolized and stored at -20-degrees-C for approximately 1 year
were thawed at 37-degrees-C for 30 min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2% )
were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2% in saline

were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed
was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four changes , approximately 750 ml each , of `` starting buffer ''
, pH 8.6 , was 0.005 M in Af and 0.039 M in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminometha ( Tris )
the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a Af cm column of EEAE-cellulose equilibrated with starting buffer
, containing 0.78 mEq of N/g , was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose , 100 - 230 mesh
amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity
was done at 6-degrees-C using gradient elution , essentially according to Sober and Peterson
concave gradient employed ( fig. 2 ) was obtained with a nine-chambered gradient elution device ( `` Varigrad '' , reference ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere
, a shallow concave gradient ( Fig. 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` cone-sphere '' apparatus , the `` cone '' being a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask and the `` sphere , '' a 2-liter round-bottom flask
contained 1700 ml of buffer ; ; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer , 0.50 M in both Af and Tris , pH 4.1
rate of 72 Af was used and 12 ml fractions were collected
fractions were obtained from each column
read at 280 m**ym in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above

identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5-degrees-C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline
latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2-degrees-C by surrounding the apparatus with ice
pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments
was carried out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer , pH 8.6 , ionic strength 0.075 , at room temperature on Whatman 3MM filter paper
were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using a Spinco Analytrol
electrophoresis was to be used for preparation , eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run/chamber under the conditions described above
end of the run , the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried , stained for 1 hr , washed and dried , while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at 1-degree-C
strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands
sections containing a given protein were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluates were tested for antibody activity

the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline , pH 7.2 , ionic strength 0.154
then centrifuged at 59,780 Pm for 35 to 80 min at 20-degrees-C in a Spinco model E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25%
were computed as Af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the Schlieren patterns
ultracentrifugation , fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less , transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline
then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being used throughout the run
fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity
will be described below
results The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity , regardless of the blood group of the donor
of the gradients described , chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at least three regions ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) : one of extremely low anionic binding capacity , one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity
been labeled Regions 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig. 1
early part of the gradient was flattened , either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the `` cone-sphere '' gradient to become established more slowly , Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas ( donors P. J. and R. S. , Fig. 1 and E. M. , Fig. 2 )
procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak ( Region 1a ) between Regions 1 and 2
of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 )
after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P. J. , D. A. , and J. F. , Fig. 1 )
these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity , as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas
cases , most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity
particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all
to be no difference in the distribution of anti-A and anti-B activity in group O serum , though in two group O donors ( J. F. and E. M. ) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity ( Figs. 1 and 2 )
of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et al
were tested for ABO agglutinin activity , using fractions from group AB plasma as a control
, most of the activity was found in Fraction Af , with slight activity seen in Fraction 4-1
of Fraction Af from group O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer , dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2
, both anti-A and anti-B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis
both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate , having extremely low , low , and high anionic binding capacity , respectively ( Fig. 3 )
whole sera revealed that the areas of Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide
antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram ; ; the complete , in the latter part
containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions ( Fig. 1 )
cases the activity against Af cells was spread over a wider area than that with Af cells , regardless of the type of test ( saline , albumin , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison
material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity
agglutination of Af cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing `` only '' incomplete antibody activity
later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera ; ; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample , no complete antibody activity could be detected
the honeybee , practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor
you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season , when you are turning over sods in your garden , but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all
their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies , and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt
add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn
on them alone that the future of their race depends , for all their relatives ( mothers , husbands , brothers , and unmated sisters ) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather
of the queens will die before the winter is over , falling prey to enemies or disease
emerge on some nice , sunny day in March or April , when the temperature is close to 50-degrees and there is not too much wind
thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest , or otherwise a good sloe tree , or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins
of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble : honeybees , bumblebees , and other wild bees , and also various kinds of flies
a happy , buzzing crowd
willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers
not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs , and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green , black-tipped little scale
the flowers , one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts
the nectaries or honey glands ( Fig. 26 , page 74 )
willow catkins , then , provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen ; ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread , a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed
exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites
deal with these later on
, honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins
have already seen in the first chapter , bumblebees are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees , exhibiting various combinations of black , yellow , white and orange
not try to key them out at this stage of the game , and let us just call them Bombus
be several dozen species in the United States alone
really insist on knowing their names , an excellent book on the North American species is Bumblebees And Their Ways by O. E. Plath
manage to keep track of a Bombus queen after she has left her feeding place , we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep
a queen , a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting place
seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such as a deserted mouse nest , a bird house , or the hole made by a woodpecker ; ; some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss
has made up her mind , the queen starts out by constructing , in her chosen abode , a small `` floor '' of dried grass or some woolly material
, she builds an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture called beebread
builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey
a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed
afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen , taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots
larvae hatch , they feed on the beebread , although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother
to add to the pollen supply as needed
, kept warm by the queen , are full grown in about ten days
makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates
two weeks , the first young emerge , four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees , collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying
worker bees do not mate or lay eggs ; ; males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season
of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed
middle of the summer , many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens begin to appear
males or drones are produced , mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers , although a few may be produced by the queen
queens and drones leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter
an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing , for instance , in August
then is still very high
old nest , the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females
result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die out completely
itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths
, though , does the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described
of the bee family have become idlers , social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives
thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo-bumblebee '' as it is called in some European countries
of Psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize
sure way to tell victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the case of the idler , Psithyrus , lack the pollen baskets -- naturally
parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host
succeeds , she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment
never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally
the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread
, they and the mother Psithyrus are fed by the Bombus workers
, in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills the Bombus queen
us return , after this gruesome interlude , to our willow catkins in the spring ; ; there are other wild bees that command our attention
almost certain that some of these , usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees , are andrenas or mining bees
about 200 different kinds of Andrena in Europe alone
my favorites is A. armata , a species very common in England , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee
like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns , where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds
in size to a honeybee , A. armata is much more beautiful in color , at least in the female of the species : a rich , velvety , rusty red
are much duller
mated , an Andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground , forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil
part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or `` cells '' , each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread
of the Andrena larvae is very rapid , so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults
are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer , fall , and winter
, next spring , coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants
Sacramento valley in California , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins
be due to a completely identical response to the weather , in the plant and the animal
male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle is repeated
is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee
history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species
, social life in the group of the bees is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature
basis of its life history , we like to think that Andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees
in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect , either
pollen baskets and possesses only a large number of long , branched hairs on its legs , on which the pollen grains will collect
will do a reasonably good job , so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind
to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees
can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains , for example , in Utah and central Washington
United States Department of Agriculture's Yearbook Of Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects , George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females
burrows are only an inch or two apart , and the bee cities cover several acres
history of the alkali bee is similar to that of Andrena , but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer , and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage
places , there are two generations a year , a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer
plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias
just be pride in my adopted State of Washington , but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and Prosser in July or August , when the bees are in their most active period
`` alkali bee '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places
although by no means always , these are indeed alkaline
is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist ; ; yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either
dense vegetation
one find such conditions
chance , of course , is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry , so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth
( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length
Klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes , and Charles C. Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes ( Thamnophis ) show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults
states that `` when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception , with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity
hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity ; ; he was working with species of Java , so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect
giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions
of slow growth have been omitted
possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves
to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda )
the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length
of the six ( the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data ) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length , the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage
speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda
in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet
comes to rate of early growth , the Indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years , more or less
rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the reticulate python
few data on the boa constrictor , those for the anaconda are unconvincing , and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python
likely that the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently ; ; it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep
make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet
records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions
often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity , but this apparently is an overestimation
way to determine the correct figure ( in captives ) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth , a method that produced surprising results : maturing of a male Indian python in less than two years , his mate in less than three ; ; data on the boa constrictor about match this
is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity
this approach amply confirm the direct observations : about three years are required , there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required
amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data
information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a 10-foot maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature
in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers , which I shall consider separately
were much alike : lined snake ( Tropidoclonion ) , one year and nine months ; ; red-bellied snake ( Storeria ) , two years ; ; cottonmouth ( Ancistrodon ) , two years
the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found
that in the southern species , which are rapidly growing types , females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three
have ascertained that in the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old , and that the young may be born every other year , rather than annually
showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature at about the age of two
Oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions
skins are of little value ; ; every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer
of all the pitfalls , there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants
proves to be the fly in the ointment , but the reason for this is not clear ; ; the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical South America might be responsible
three levels on which to treat the subject
is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh
rejects virtually all field measurements
level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion ; ; field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected , and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated
level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire
against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes , about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again , or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards ; ; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove , to the scientific mind , the existence of hoop snakes , joint snakes , or ghosts
recently used the second-level approach with the largest snakes , and has come to these conclusions : the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet , the reticulate python 33 , the African rock python 25 , the amethystine python at least 22 , the Indian python 20 , and the boa constrictor 18-1/2
also treats of the largest snakes , but on the third level , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda
that as anacondas 30 feet long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freaks '' over 50
dimensions of 70 feet and more
chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength , but these seem to be given to complete his picture , not to be believed
on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows
the six giants Discussions of the giants one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; ; time required to reach maturity ; ; rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; ; and maximum length , with confirmation or amplification of Oliver's figures
on the growth of senile individuals is lacking
At birth , this species varies considerably in size
of twenty-eight born at Brookfield Zoo , near Chicago , ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches and averaged 29 inches
Griffin gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas , presumably members of a brood , from `` South America '' ; ; the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the Brookfield brood and its average
Ditmars had two broods that averaged 27 inches
Mole and F. W. Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries
reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces ( this snake must have been emaciated ) for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British Guiana
, Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches , and four young were born in London at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces
a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces
between subspecies might explain the great range in size
little information on the anaconda's rate of growth
had one that increased from 19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years , and J. J. Quelch records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years
very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate
, Afranio Do Amaral , the noted Brazilian herpetologist , wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes
that the anaconda's maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less than 46 feet )
his estimate lies between Oliver's suggestion of at least 37 feet and the 50-foot `` monstrous freaks '' intimated by Heuvelmans
convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon , a petroleum geologist of the Richmond Oil Company , and reported in 1944 by Emmett R. Dunn
as a field measurement , it is open to question
feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable
many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet
possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area
difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies
: A Colombian female's brood of sixteen boa constrictors born in the Staten Island Zoo averaged 20 inches
length seems to be typical
thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected
is from 14 to 25 inches ; ; the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a Central American female ( see chapter on Laying , Brooding , Hatching , and Birth ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual
as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes , these data must be taken tentatively ; ; final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities
Hoge's measurements of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male
surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity
has written to me of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in March 1940
, collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua , was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from snout to vent ( her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long )
from Central America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long
there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate ; ; unfortunately , no one has kept complete records of one individual , whereas many have been made for a very short period of time
are too varied to allow generalization
and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout
vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship ( figs. 8 , 22 )
difference is noted here
artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura ( fig. 8 )
artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply
, as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles -- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole
artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group
3 ( ( fig. 3 ) is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2
characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura ( fig. 9 )
distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles ( figs. 14 , 15 )
instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1
one area to another are , therefore , conceivable
bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 ( ( fig. 24 )
, however , is not maintained centrally
pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( figs. 23 , 24 )
artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals
in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the hilar lymph nodes , vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein , the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles
type 1 , , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen ( figs. 9 , 10 )
supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches
dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once
these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface
of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches
increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted
accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery
of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum ( figs. 16 , 23 , 24 )
regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery
could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed ( figs. 17 , 18 )
other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; ; through the interlobular septa ; ; and along the terminal bronchiole ( figs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 )
arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level ( fig. 26 )
is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made
of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined
the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse
and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse
interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; ; probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ; and , in contrast , are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van Allen and Lindskog , '31 )
for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present
wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well
, the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 , and 3
also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse
, it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog
the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others ( Birnbaum , '54 ) in the human being
area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries
as 1858 , Le Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings
, this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz
to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller ( '50 )
however , Miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study ( Loosli , '38 )
noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat ( Miller , '13 ; ; '25 )
of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear
this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung
and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues
they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , '13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , '58 )
an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus
be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema
not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2
of normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch , and thereafter by many others
'58 ) , Verloop ( '48 ) , Marchand , Gilroy and Watson ( '50 ) , Von Hayek ( '53 ) , and Tobin ( '52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being
'50 ) is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint
of the latter's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level
as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure
Brailsford and Daly in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this
studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards
distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable
is further supported by Verloop's ( '48 ) demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves
words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts
, little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses
'48 ; ; '49 ) found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats
Grindlay and Edwards ( '52 ) also were unable to find them in rats
'58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs
that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred
the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species
, however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog
, these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs
, a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent
for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man
especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man
it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species
main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented
of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types
, is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; ; type 3 , , by the horse
extremely well developed in type 1 ; ; absent in type 2 ; ; imperfectly developed in type 3
and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 and 3
is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent
to the pleura in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type 2 , by the pulmonary artery
1 , 2 and 3 the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole
3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed
bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present
respiratory bronchioles , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2
1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum
be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present
3 , this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2
the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1
the Onset Profile spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls
, 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile ( excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period , approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls
Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence
for both sexes , the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile
standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early ( Table 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets
the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls , a fact which confirms data for other groups of children
Profile and Completion Profile are constructed to serve as norms for children
convenient to classify a child's onset ages and completion ages as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child's age equivalent `` dots '' appeared to the left of , upon , or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line
dot appears close to the end of the transverse line , the `` moderate '' rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age
may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots upon or close to the mean
lower portion of each Chart , the Skeletal Age ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified
middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls
curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation , and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation
a child's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve
the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity Chart : each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers
the upper portion requires series of films for every child , consisting of those from Hand , Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , and Foot
portion necessitates only films of Hand
the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long , short , and round bones of the five regions
portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly , since only two long bones are included in Hand and Wrist as a region
the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level , Onset and Completion
portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset and Completion
the two indicators are for the most part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center
portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood
Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile
be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body
maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence
clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement
Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood
earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions -- particularly the former -- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period
indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress
stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 2
approach to doing this , Figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2
between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows
for boy 34 appear in Figure 3 , and for girl 2 in Figure 4
system used in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers
dot '' on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center
tip '' of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center
the alignment of the `` dots '' and `` tips '' , respectively , indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls
in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at Completion from the level at Onset
`` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` Same schedule ''
of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at Completion over that at Onset , and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure , or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables
between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in Figures 3 and 4
is readily clarified by referring to Table 1
, arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4
boy , this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion
the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center's ability to `` catch up '' in ossification is demonstrated
, for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset and delayed at Completion
the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between Onset and Completion
Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period
the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in Table 1
attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child -- more than 1700 values for the entire group -- by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center
and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center
figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the Appendix
used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix
center in a short bone -- distal phalanx of the second finger -- was chosen as an example for discussion here , primarily because epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion , the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones , occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage
thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence
summary , based on Figures 5 and 6 , is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center
top of Figure 5 , for example , the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in Table 1
arrows , denoting onset age plus completion age deviations , have been arrayed in an Onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 34 girls
center depicted here , in the distal phalanx of the second finger , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones
onset age was 25.3 months ( Table 1 ) , and the average Span of the osseous stage was 133 months
( Table 2 ) between onset age and completion age was -.50 , and that between onset age and Span was -.10
consideration for the limits of precision in assessing , expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement , each arrow with a `` shaft length '' of four months or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion , for this particular epiphysis
girls 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion
clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls
if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule ''
example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure : girl 2 had a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion
of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group
analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage
, 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion ; ; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys
, like girl 2 , did not have `` same schedule '' ; ; his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean
dot '' on his arrow indicates early Onset and the `` tip '' indicates relatively later Completion
42 figures had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6 , classifications of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them
, the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and is enhanced by the absence of potassium ( Wolff , 1960 )

iodine The precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood
the formation of organically bound iodine , mainly mono-iodotyrosine , can be accomplished in cell-free systems
absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ; Taurog , Potter and Chaikoff , 1955 ; ; Taurog , Potter , Tong , and Chaikoff , 1956 ; ; Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ; De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 )
does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems
, the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine
and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid , large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can be formed ( Alexander , 1959 )
not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism , and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue
grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to Af and then to Af as the active iodinating species
thyroid gland it appears that proteins ( chiefly thyroglobulin ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated
tyrosine , however , is not enough for the synthesis of hormone
and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine
of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine analogues ( Pitt-Rivers and James , 1958 )
so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control
nature of the iodocompounds is discussed below ( pp. 76 et seq. )

Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin
has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems , nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in vitro been unequivocally proven
some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 )
have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes , whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide
, depending on availability of dietary iodine , thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine

the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine ( cf. Section C ) , it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion
of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid
the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; ; Alpers , Robbins and Rall , 1955 )
that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid glands from TSH-treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo
no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known
of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates ( Alpers , Petermann and Rall , 1956 )
enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes
de-iodinase with a pH optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity , has been identified in the thyroid ( Stanbury , 1957 )
enzyme is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine
assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid , where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin
and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream
been shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine , but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong
been suggested that the plasma thyroxine-binding proteins , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( Ingbar and Freinkel , 1957 )

Antithyroid drugs are of two general types
has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoro type
inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid
not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such
group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil
have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism , but they inhibit organification
of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin ( Astwood , 1954 )
other hand , there are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type , such as resorcinol , possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine
the antithyroid drugs , of either type , if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre , owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis , with production of hypothyroidism
lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of TSH , causing the thyroid to enlarge
of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet
drugs of the thiouracil type , however , are not antagonised by such means
of the thiouracil and resorcinol types , certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods
conclusively identified is L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone , which was isolated from rutabaga ( Greer , 1950 )
presumed to occur in other members of the Brassica family
some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in Tasmania and Australia ( Clements and Wishart , 1956 )
seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen , which is then secreted in the milk

Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet , the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland
experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; ; Stanbury , Brownell , Riggs , Perinetti , Itoiz , and Del Castillo , 1954 )
the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre is about 100 **ymg per day
levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine
the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally
presence of a low iodine intake , thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with Af is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal , the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced
to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin
deficiency persists long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the Af label will reflect the Af distribution in the thyroglobulin
might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis

hormone The name thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence
has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone
present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of Af
shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of TSH in blood
1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying TSH , and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject

and physical properties of pituitary tsh As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce ( 1851 ) that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid
was clarified by Smith and Smith ( 1922 ) , who showed that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles
attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later , when Janssen and Loeser ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities
work other investigators applied salt-fractionation techniques to the problem , as well as fractionation with organic solvents , such as acetone
1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations of TSH made during this period , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting material
this work has been reviewed by White ( 1944 ) and by Albert ( 1949 )
to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg ( 1958 )
last few years , the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating TSH has led to further purification ( Bates and Condliffe , 1960 ; ; Pierce , Carsten and Wynston , 1960 )
active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in potency , composition and physical properties
present themselves in considering any hormone in blood
is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored
what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction
therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood TSH is to be discussed rationally
of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients ( Adams , 1958 )
abnormal TSH differs chemically from pituitary TSH , or is , alternatively , normal TSH with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood constituent , cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary Aj
data on the concentration of TSH in blood , one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used to obtain them
of the United States Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time
like to re-emphasise the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of TSH activity and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units
most part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard

and units of thyroid-stimulating activity The international unit ( u. ) , adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories ( Mussett and Perry , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount of activity present in 13.5 mg of the International Standard Preparation
unit is equipotent with the USP unit adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the USP reference substance
weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use
have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced weakness , this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups
described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of steroids for a refractory anemia
case This patient was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness and general debility
the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were given over a period of 4 years
first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive of myelofibrosis
transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July , 1957 , in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg. daily
was continued until February , 1958
, 1958 , the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated by pulmonary edema
at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans , and cholelithiasis
was 11.6 gm.
digitalization and anticoagulation
chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure
increasing anemia , triamcinolone , 8 mg. daily , was started on Feb. 23 , 1958 , and was continued until July , 1958
, 1958 , the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia ; ; the hemoglobin was 10.6 gm.
attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component , triamcinolone , 16 mg. daily , was begun on Sept. 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb. 18 , 1959
the patient felt stronger , and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm. , but on Oct. 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` caving in '' in his knees
8 , 1958 , weakness , specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature , was pronounced , and a common complaint was `` difficulty in stepping up on to curbs ''
30 mg. daily , was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov. 22 until Dec. 1 , 1958 , without any improvement in the weakness
at this time was 3.8 mEq. per liter , and the hemoglobin was 13.9 gm. By Dec. 1 , 1958 , the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse , and it became difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position
16 mg. daily , was resumed and maintained until Feb. 18 , 1959
omitted for a 2-week period , but there was no change in the muscle weakness
time a detailed neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was moderate in the hands and feet , but marked in the shoulders , hips , and pelvic girdle , with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes
or sensory defects were found
no evidence of lower motor neuron disease
tests yielded normal results
iodine was 6.6 mg. , and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was 46% in 24 hours , with a conversion ratio of 12%
test demonstrated normal absorption of vitamin Af
, 1959 , during the second admission to The New York Hospital , a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections
potassium levels remained normal ; ; the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was 10 units per ml. per min.
impression at this time was either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis
12 , 1959 , purified corticotropin ( ACTH Gel ) , 20 units daily intramuscularly , was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention
3 to May 1 , 1949 , the patient was maintained on dexamethasone , 3 to 6 mg. daily
1959 , prednisone , 30 mg. daily , replaced the dexamethasone
did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches
of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness
to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted , as well as fever , malaise , anorexia , anxiety , and an exacerbation of the anemia
were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism
pain in June , 1959 , prompted a third hospital admission
with partial collapse of D8 was found
diet , calcium lactate supplements , and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness
hospital admission on June 27 , 1959 , was necessitated by continued weakness and debility complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids
of the vertebral column showed progression of the demineralization

were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less evident in the pectoralis , diaphragm , and transversus

to the nuclear changes described above , another change in muscle nuclei was seen , usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae

thought to represent regenerating fibers
failed to show fibrosis in the involved muscles
of the sections examined , the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal
the conjugates In attempting to improve specificity of staining , the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders ( Coons , 1958 ) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( E. F. Smith & Townsend ) on sweet clover stems
) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 - 50 mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet clover stems
were extracted with 3 volumes of Af in Af to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80% saturation with Af
was washed twice with an 80% saturated solution of Af , dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer , dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen
) In other experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade ( 1957 )
) The conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer ( PBS ) containing Af potassium phosphate and Af
frozen sections The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by Coons et al ( 1951 )
stem tumors from sweet clover plants infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen , embedded in ice , and cut at 3 - 6 **ym in a cryostat maintained at -16-degrees to -20-degrees
were mounted on cold slides smeared with Haupts' adhesive ( Johansen , 1940 ) in earlier experiments , and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by Schramm and Rottger ( 1959 )
adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory
were then thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30 minutes ; ; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks
indirect method
were fixed in acetone for 15 minutes and dried at 37-degrees for 30 minutes
them were then covered with a drop of Af in a moist chamber at 24-degrees for 30 - 40 minutes
other sections were similarly covered with Aj
then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes
out most of the saline around the sections , a drop of Af was layered over each of the sections , allowed to react for 30 minutes , and then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes
out most of the liquid around the sections , the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine ( 7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of PBS )

the sections under the fan , fixing in acetone , and drying at 37-degrees as in the indirect method , the sections were treated with conjugated Af or Af ( undiluted unless mentioned otherwise ) for 5 - 30 minutes
, other sections were similarly treated with Af or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain of potato yellow-dwarf virus ( Wolcyrz and Black , 1956 )
were then washed with PBS for 15 - 30 minutes and mounted in buffered glycerine
Stained or unstained sections were examined under dark field illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp ( Osram HBO 200 )
beam from the lamp was filtered through a half-standard thickness Corning 1840 filter
eyepiece a Wratten 2 B filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light
filter , Zeiss barrier filter with the code ( Schott ) designation BG 23 , was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence
of staining indirect method
first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder
sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder
sweet clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1 : 10 solution of Af for 30 minutes , washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes , stained with Af for 30 minutes , and washed for 15 minutes in Aj
showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells of the pseudophloem tissue ( Lee and Black , 1955 )
fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive sections stained with 1 : 10 dilution of NS and Af or with Af alone
mounted in buffered glycerine or sections treated only with NS or Af did not show such green fluorescence
crown gall tissue similarly stained with either Af and Af or NS and Af also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence
the nonspecific staining by the Af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen
of Af with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of Af ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) , NS and Af with crown gall tissue powder , or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining
all the sera with sweet clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence , especially when the treated conjugate was diluted to 1 : 2 with 0.85% saline
the above procedures , when the intermediate sera were diluted to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85% saline , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced , whereas , a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 : 500 or diluting the Af to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence
sections with PBS before layering the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction
to other treatments , treating the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layering Af did not reduce nonspecific staining
treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate through a DEAE-cellulose column
ml of conjugate was passed through a column ( Af ) , the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments , and very little in others
latter cases an additional treatment of the DEAE-cellulose-treated Af with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the specificity
treatments the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining
purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with 1 : 10 dilution of Af for 30 minutes , washing with PBS for 15 minutes , staining with Af for 30 minutes , and washing with PBS for 15 minutes
of staining in WTV tumors with Af and Af but not with NS and Af or with antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus and Af , and the absence of such staining in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover , indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained

first conjugated with 50 mg of FITC per gram of globulin
was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method
cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence
experiments , Af and Af were prepared by conjugating 8 mg of FITC per gram of globulin
Af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate ( with 50 mg FITC per gram of globulin ) while the specific staining was similar in both cases
could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column as described for Af
staining procedure with this purified Af consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 minutes and washing in PBS for 15 minutes
of staining with Af was established as follows : Af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover
tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus
Af through DEAE-cellulose , the titer of antibodies to WTV in the specific fraction was 1 : 4 of the titer before such passage ( precipitin ring tests by R. F. Whitcomb ) ; ; but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining
that increase in specificity of Af after passing it through DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution
by DEAE-cellulose treated Af and Af , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells , was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography
chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells
from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant
virus antigen Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors
antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue
few isolated thick-walled cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the xylem region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cells , ray cells , or pith
pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm
was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells
are thought to represent the nuclei
tumor sections small spherical bodies , possibly inclusion bodies ( Littau and Black , 1952 ) stained more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen
cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of WTV antigen
both the direct and indirect methods of staining , the conjugates had nonspecifically staining fractions
indirect method , this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with NS and Af or with Af only
direct method , Af , not further treated , stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems nonspecifically and WTV tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable Af
and Af were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present
the conjugates with ethyl acetate , and the conjugates ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse liver powder , sweet clover crown gall tissue powder , or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates
of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems ( Coons , 1958 )
Rottger ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco mosaic virus
for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known
work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a DEAE-cellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder
staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that WTV antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled cells in the xylem region , but was not detectable in any other tissues of the root and stem tumors
of the distribution of WTV antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm
is a leafhopper transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation ( Black , 1944 ; ; Brakke et al , 1954 )
and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to infect plants
reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man , in addition , by complex symbols , one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex
with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex , the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated
the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions
complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey A on seeing monkey B ( but not a rabbit ) in emotional stress
extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges
to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned , and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism
, the neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates , as Mirsky's interesting experiment on the `` communication of affect '' demonstrates
in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex
correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species , as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain ( including the hypothalamus ) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions
be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity
are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response
brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory , but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper

and its significance After this brief discussion of neo- , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations , let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance
take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways
discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges
other hand , the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored
a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex
if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level , the lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges
a vicious cycle develops
can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways
believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism
comment further on these pathological conditions , we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness
a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness , resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition
the dominance in parasympathetic action ( with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level induces , by its peripheral action , the autonomic symptoms of sleep and , by its action on the cortex , a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system
dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus , the opposite changes occur
stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep , it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus
can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals
importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect
drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it , there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance
comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs , the latter the tranquilizers
exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as , for instance , between reserpine and chlorpromazine
these differences are , they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side , we produce depressions , whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and , eventually , maniclike changes
states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner ; ; synchrony prevails in the EEG of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers , but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drugs
therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance
and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges
the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side
the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test
have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the Mecholyl test and , conversely , between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm
the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients
and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable
assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle
in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or , in special circumstances , to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting
conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished , but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs
differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated
clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity
of parasympathetic `` tuning '' of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli , but leads also to an autonomic reversal : a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response
conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level , and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic `` tuning '' are observed
for instance , such a change is produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks , previously inhibited conditioned reactions reappear
if these procedures are applied more often , conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished
studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes
further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance ; ; ( 2 ) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions ; ; ( 3 ) in a state of depression , the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing ( alerting ) effect on the Aj
few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes

physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion
is the case , one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise
out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms , particularly in certain types of personality , but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ( `` abreaction '' ) may cure a battle neurosis
raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses
strictly physiological procedure , one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself
and therapeutic work lie in this area
convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible
observation of Pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means
conditioning experiment , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain
electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding
became thus the symbol for food and elicited salivary secretion ( conditioned reflex )
the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain
nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding
showed that this is , indeed , possible
applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses
advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established
interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions
antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho- and ergotropic systems
a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety
both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present , different autonomic-somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety , respectively , as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines , the state of the muscle tone , and the Mecholyl test
incompatibility of these emotional states seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference

In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively
the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic-cortical discharge
are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents
of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes

decomposition theorem We are trying to study a linear operator T on the finite-dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary
do this through the characteristic values and vectors of T in certain special cases , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial for T factors over the scalar field F into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1
we do with the general T
try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems
T may not have a single characteristic value ; ; this is really a deficiency in the scalar field , namely , that it is not algebraically closed
even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely over F into a product of polynomials of degree 1 , there may not be enough characteristic vectors for T to span the space V
clearly a deficiency in T
situation is illustrated by the operator T on Af ( F any field ) represented in the standard basis by Af
polynomial for A is Af and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for A ( or for T )
is not diagonalizable
that this happens because the null space of Af has dimension 1 only
other hand , the null space of Af and the null space of Af together span V , the former being the subspace spanned by Af and the latter the subspace spanned by Af and Af
be more or less our general method for the second problem
remember this is an assumption ) the minimal polynomial for T decomposes Af where Af are distinct elements of F , then we shall show that the space V is the direct sum of the null spaces of Af
operator is the special case of this in which Af for each i
which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial , whether or not the primes which enter are all of first degree
will find it helpful to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think of the proof of Theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem

decomposition theorem )
be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F
be the minimal polynomial for T , Af , where the Af , are distinct irreducible monic polynomials over F and the Af are positive integers
be the null space of Af
A ) Af ; ; ( B ) each Af is invariant under T ; ; ( C ) if Af is the operator induced on Af by T , then the minimal polynomial for Af is Af

of the proof is this
direct-sum decomposition ( A ) is valid , how can we get hold of the projections Af associated with the decomposition
Af will be the identity on Af and zero on the other Af
find a polynomial Af such that Af is the identity on Af and is zero on the other Af , and so that Af , etc.
i , let Af
are distinct prime polynomials , the polynomials Af are relatively prime ( Theorem 8 , Chapter 4 )
are polynomials Af such that Af
that if Af , then Af is divisible by the polynomial p , because Af contains each Af as a factor
show that the polynomials Af behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof

and P divides Af for Af , we have Af
Af are projections which correspond to some direct-sum decomposition of the space V
to show that the range of Af is exactly the subspace Af
clear that each vector in the range of Af is in Af for if **ya is in the range of Af , then Af and so Af because Af is divisible by the minimal polynomial P
suppose that **ya is in the null space of Af
, then Af is divisible by Af and so Af , i.e. , Af
it is immediate that Af , i.e. , that **ya is in the range of Af
the proof of statement ( A )
certainly clear that the subspaces Af are invariant under T
is the operator induced on Af by T , then evidently Af , because by definition Af is 0 on the subspace Af
that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af
let G be any polynomial such that Af

is divisible by the minimal polynomial P of T , i.e. , Af divides Af
easily seen that Af divides G
minimal polynomial for Af is Af

are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of T , then each Af is a polynomial in T , and accordingly if a linear operator U commutes with T then U commutes with each of the Af , i.e. , each subspace Af is invariant under U
notation of the proof of Theorem 12 , let us take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for T is a product of first-degree polynomials , i.e. , the case in which each Af is of the form Af
range of Af is the null space Af of Af
put Af
10 , D is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of T
look at the operator Af
Af so Af
should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that Af and in general that Af
for each i , we shall have Af , because the operator Af will then be 0 on the range of Af

be a linear operator on the vector space V
that N is nilpotent if there is some positive integer R such that Af

be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F
the minimal polynomial for T decomposes over F into a product of linear polynomials
is a diagonalizable operator D on V and a nilpotent operator N in V such that ( A ) Af , ( b ) Af
operator D and the nilpotent operator N are uniquely determined by ( A ) and ( B ) and each of them is a polynomial in T

just observed that we can write Af where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T
that we also have Af where D' is diagonalizable , N' is nilpotent , and Af
prove that Af
and N' commute with one another and Af , we see that D' and N' commute with T
and N' commute with any polynomial in T ; ; hence they commute with D and with N
have Af or Af and all four of these operators commute with one another
and D' are both diagonalizable and they commute , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and Af is diagonalizable
and N' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator Af is nilpotent ; ; for , using the fact that N and N' commute Af and so when R is sufficiently large every term in this expression for Af will be 0
, a nilpotent operator on an n-dimensional space must have its T power 0 ; ; if we take Af above , that will be large enough
follows that Af is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression
Af is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent
operator is obviously the zero operator ; ; for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form Af for some Af ; ; but then since the operator is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root ; ; hence Af and the minimal polynomial is simply x , which says the operator is 0
see that Af and Af

be a finite-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field F , e.g. , the field of complex numbers
linear operator T in V can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator D and a nilpotent operator N which commute
D and N are unique and each is a polynomial in T
results , one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators
spaces over non-algebraically closed fields , we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors
a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter
this section , we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem
chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear algebra

primary decomposition theorem , it is not necessary that the vector space V be finite dimensional , nor is it necessary for parts ( A ) and ( B ) that P be the minimal polynomial for T
is a linear operator on an arbitrary vector space and if there is a monic polynomial P such that Af , then parts ( A ) and ( B ) of Theorem 12 are valid for T with the proof which we gave
be a positive integer and let V be the space of all N times continuously differentiable functions F on the real line which satisfy the differential equation Af where Af are some fixed constants
denotes the space of N times continuously differentiable functions , then the space V of solutions of this differential equation is a subspace of Af
denotes the differentiation operator and P is the polynomial Af then V is the null space of the operator p ( , ) , because Af simply says Af
now regard D as a linear operator on the subspace V

are discussing differentiable complex-valued functions , then Af and V are complex vector spaces , and Af may be any complex numbers
write Af where Af are distinct complex numbers
is the null space of Af , then Theorem 12 says that Af
words , if F satisfies the differential equation Af , then F is uniquely expressible in the form Af where Af satisfies the differential equation Af
the study of the solutions to the equation Af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form Af
has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra , i.e. , by the primary decomposition theorem
the space of solutions to Af , one must know something about differential equations ; ; that is , one must know something about D other than the fact that it is a linear operator
one does not need to know very much
very easy to establish by induction on R that if F is in Af then Af ; ; that is , Af , etc.
if and only if Af
G such that Af , i.e. , Af , must be a polynomial function of degree Af or less : Af
satisfies Af if and only if F has the form Af
the ' functions ' Af span the space of solutions of Af
are linearly independent functions and the exponential function has no zeros , these R functions Af , form a basis for the space of solutions

binomial experiments Some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials , each with two possible outcomes
probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another
a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models
with a few examples of binomial experiments

marksman shooting five rounds at a target , all under practically the same conditions , may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times
sets of five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary
we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes
mice
of eight mice from similar parents , the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8
should be attached to these possible outcomes
ones ) with three dice
dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of aces is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 )
problem
, suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` non-success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial
examples above , the occurrence of a bull's-eye , a straight-haired mouse , or an ace could be called a `` success ''
, any outcome we choose may be labeled `` success ''
question in this chapter is : What is the probability of exactly X successes in N trials
3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples , usually by counting points in a sample space
a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind
this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind ''
often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated
marksmanship example , a trial consists of `` one round shot at a target '' with outcome either one bull's-eye ( success ) or none ( failure )
an experiment might consist of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed of several repetitions of the five-round experiment
dice are tossed , a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials
what amounts to the same thing , if one die is tossed three times , each toss is a trial , and the three tosses form the experiment
we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times
are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly

managers
act as managers for a high-school football team , and of these managers a proportion P are licensed drivers
one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck
Fridays the coach has needed a driver
these Fridays , what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times
times



there are 3 trials of interest
consists of choosing a student manager at random
possible outcomes on each trial are `` driver '' or `` nondriver ''
choice is by lot each week , the outcomes of different trials are independent
stay the same , so that Af is the same for all weeks
generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments
experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment , it must have four properties : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number of trials , ( 2 ) each trial must result in a `` success '' or a `` failure '' ( a binomial trial ) , ( 3 ) all trials must have identical probabilities of success , ( 4 ) the trials must be independent of each other
use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties
give , for each property , an example where the property is absent
and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter

be a fixed number n of repeated trials
marksman , we study sets of five shots ( Af ) ; ; for the mice , we restrict attention to litters of eight ( Af ) ; ; and for the aces , we toss three dice ( Af )
a fixed number of trials
die until an ace appears
number of trials is a random variable , not a fixed number


the N trials is either a success or a failure
'' and `` failure '' are just convenient labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general
are more expressive than labels like `` A '' and `` not-A ''
natural from the marksman's viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success , but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse
`` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms P and Af that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure ''
there are many outcomes for a single trial , we group these outcomes into two classes , as in the example of the die , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes `` ace '' and `` not-ace ''
the two-class property
mice as `` straight-haired '' or `` wavy-haired '' , but a hairless mouse appears
escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not constituting a trial , but such a solution is not always satisfactory

have identical probabilities of success
has probability Af of producing an ace ; ; the marksman has some probability p , perhaps 0.1 , of making a bull's-eye
we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial
p is not constant
round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman , lowering his chance of a bull's-eye

are independent
, this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials
the three-dice example Af , Af , and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace , not-ace , ace in that order is Af
we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another
independence fails
of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains , and a coin is tossed to decide
to know the number of people going to the mountains
experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials , one for each member of the family , the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent
the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family
is a less extreme example of dependence
visiting an art museum
votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize
one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure ''
consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials
of the experiment from couple to couple , the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply , because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors
illustrates the point
shows that 0.6 of the boys and 0.6 of the girls vote for picture A
under independent voting , Af or 0.36 of the couples would cast two votes for picture A , and Af or 0.16 would cast two votes for picture B
independent voting , Af or 0.52 of the couples would agree
7-1 shows that Af or 0.70 agree , too many for independent voting
of an n-trial binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through N as the value of the random variable X , where Af
to study the probability function of this random variable
, we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes , not which shots were bull's-eyes
experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes
, the marksman gets 5 shots , but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bull's-eye , that is , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( or 5 , if he gets no bull's-eye )
do not score the number of bull's-eyes , and the random variable is not the number of successes
of P and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice
very slight changes in P do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference
instance , see Example 2 of Section 5-5 , on red cards in hands of 5
the other hand , even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied , the binomial model may still be used as a baseline for comparative purposes ; ; that is , we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model
: A binomial experiment consists of Af independent binomial trials , all with the same probability Af of yielding a success
of the experiment is X successes
variable X takes the values Af with probabilities Af or , more briefly Af
find a formula for the probability of exactly X successes for given values of P and N
number of successes X is paired with its probability of occurrence Af , the set of pairs Af , is a probability function called a binomial distribution
of P and N determines the binomial distribution uniquely , and different choices always produce different distributions ( except when Af ; ; then the number of successes is always 0 )
of all binomial distributions is called the family of binomial distributions , but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to `` the binomial distribution '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context is clear
were treated by James Bernoulli about 1700 , and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called Bernoulli trials

trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success
binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 , with probabilities Q and P respectively
trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable X , the total number of successes , which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials

gets two bull's-eyes , one on his third shot and one on his fifth
of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1
of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 , and there are 5 such random variables here
is X , the total number of successes , which in this experiment has the value Af
simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Af
real analytic periodic functions with period T
following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares
is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Af
theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Af there are families of such cubes
for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results
inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C
the spiral Af , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square
has one corner point on the straight line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior
, from the point P at Af to the point Q at Af , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C
increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , Af and Af , adjacent to P and Q respectively
approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both Af and Af must cross C an odd number of times as S varies from zero to T
may also touch C without crossing
crosses C when Af
have certain squares with three corners on C
such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square
on C , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction
paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing T
vertex is at Af , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90-degrees about the vertex
of intersections of Af , the rotated curve , with the original curve C consists of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at Af , plus the vertex itself
that two such curves C and Af , cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points ; ; otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points , which is impossible since they do not coincide near Af
vertex we associate certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter T between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points
vertex at Af , these values will be denoted by Af
f{t} defined in this way is multi-valued
now the graph of the function f{t} on Af
refer to the plane of C and Af as the C-plane and to the plane of the graph as the Aj
, as a set , may have a finite number of components
denote the values of f{t} on different components by Af
with abscissa T on the graph represents an intersection between C and Af
two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection
point will be any point of intersection A such that in every neighborhood of A in the C-plane , Af meets both the interior and the exterior of C
point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point
will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj
now prove several lemmas

neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f is a single-valued , continuous function

show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood
vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and Af
f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af
that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic
C-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian coordinates u , V with the origin at Q and such that both C and Af have finite slope at Q
, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U
neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued , analytic function of U
one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is monotone , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval
to find Af , one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q
is just the curve Af translated without rotation through a small arc , for Af is always obtained by rotating C through exactly 90-degrees
is itself a segment of an analytic curve
E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function
Af is single-valued near Q
also seen that Af , since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation
is also continuous at Af , and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point
now to the set of tangent points on the graph
must consist of isolated points and closed intervals
that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point
the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points

neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say Af , the function Af is either double-valued or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single-valued

point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another
change in T through an amount E results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve Af
three possibilities : ( A ) Af remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ; ( B ) Af moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for Af ; ; ( C ) Af cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every T in Af
possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the f-plane , the end points of which fall into category ( B ) or ( C )
second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af
third category the function is double-valued in this interval
remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af
the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist
neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued or no-valued on one side , and is a single-valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side
above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F
for any value of T for which all values of f{t} are ordinary points the number of values of f{t} must be odd
is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and Af must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , Af could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at T is the argument of the function , not a value
for any value of T the number of values of f{t} is equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument T plus an odd number

of ordinary values of the function f{t} at T will be called its multiplicity at T

of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj

not
component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval
is defined in the sub-interval Af
and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane ; ; otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points
we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of F can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer
multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number
true of all components which have such a bounded support
is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T
shown that the graph of F contains at least one component whose inverse is the entire interval {0,T} , and whose multiplicity is odd
be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components
( incomplete ) components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument , and are defined only on a proper sub-interval of Aj
now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C
consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C
a square with PQ as a side and with free corners Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively
varies from zero to T , the values of S for which Af and Af cross C will be denoted by Af and Af respectively
Af , plus tangent points
are just the ordinary values of Af

Af are the ordinary values at Af of a multi-valued function g{t} which has components corresponding to those of f{t}

define a function b{t} as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , b{t} is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between T and the backward corner points
F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T
P fixed at Af , Af-values occur when the corner Af crosses C , and are among the values of S such that Af
of this equation are just the ordinates of the intersections of the graph of B with a straight line of unit slope through Af in the b-plane ( the plane of the graph of b )
these values as Af , and define g{t} in the same way for each T
obtain g{t} by introducing an oblique g{t}-axis in the Aj

we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers
defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol Af
2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( A ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( B ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1
of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible

be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli Af and Af , and let **zg be a Af curve of order K on Q
line L meets Q in two points , Af and Af , through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus , Af , whose lines are simple secants of Aj
generators let Af and Af be , respectively , the harmonic conjugates of Af and Af with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets Aj
Af is the image of L
the transformation is involutorial
first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q
it did , the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af , which is impossible
from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of Af , it is clear that the only points of Q at which a line can meet its image are the points of Aj
totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj
lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of **zg , since each of these meets Q in two points which are invariant
of this congruence is Af , since Af secants of a curve of symbol ( B ) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point
of the congruence is Af , since an arbitrary plane meets **zg in K points
complex of singular lines is of order K and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula Af that the order of the involution is Af
various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique
obvious of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to Q , each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line
of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents
interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such pencils , so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent
lines of any plane , **yp , meeting Q in a conic C , are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve C' into which C is transformed in the point involution on Q
, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C'
if Af and Af are two planes intersecting in a line l , tangent to Q at a point P , the two free intersections of the image curves Af and Af must coincide at P' , the image of P , and at this point Af and Af must have a common tangent l'
thought of as a line in a particular plane **yp , any tangent to Q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through L
, **yl , of Af is also exceptional , for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point involution on Q
is of symbol Af since it meets **yl , and hence every line of Af in the Af invariant points on **yl and since it obviously meets every line of Af in a single point
of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af
class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations : Since no two generators of Af can intersect , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections
words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all
only way in which all curves of the image family of Af can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of Af which is not a secant but a tangent of **zg , for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of tangency
curves of symbol Af on Q intersect in Af points , it follows that there are Af lines of Af which are tangent to Aj
any line , l , of any bundle having one of these points of tangency , T , as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of L and Q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of Af which is tangent to **zg at T
through two of these points , Af and Af , will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the tangents to **zg at Af and Af as directrices
, C , being a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on Q , meets the image of any line of Af , which we have already found to be a Af curve on Q , in Af points
image , C' , meets any line of Af in Af points
C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point
is a Af curve on Q
the congruence of its secants , that is the image of a general plane field of lines , is of order Af and class Af
the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines , namely Af and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines , namely Af

observations make it clear that there exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve Aj
shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described
this we must first show that every line which meets **zg in a point P meets its image at P
this , consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj
1 ) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order Af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order Af
there is a Af correspondence in which the Af points cut from C by a general line , l , of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of L and the plane of the pencil
is rational , this correspondence has K coincidences , each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image
since the pencil contains a secant of **zg it actually contains only Af singular lines
this contradiction it is necessary that C be composite , with the secant of **zg and a curve of order Af as components
follows that the secants of **zg are all invariant
this is the case , then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point , P , of **zg as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order Af having Af generators concurrent at P
ruled surface of order N with N concurrent generators is necessarily a cone , it follows finally that every line through a point , P , of **zg meets its image at P , as asserted
the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex , P , on **zg which is effected by the involution as a whole
preceding remarks , it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion
in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order Af , namely the cone of secants of **zg which pass through P
follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective De Jonquieres involution of order Af and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either Af or Af
possibility requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points ; ; the second requires that there be a line through P which meets **zg in Af points
case , lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant
first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the vertex , P , to the intersection of **zg and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant
second , the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex , P , to the two intersections of **zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant
secants , of course , are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af
to these can be made at each point of Aj
must have either a regulus of Af-fold secants or a regulus of Af-fold secants
if Af , no two of the multiple secants can intersect
such were the case , either the plane of the two lines would meet **zg in more than K points or , alternatively , the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high
no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of **zg can intersect , then the regulus must be quadratic , or in other words , **zg must be either a Af or a Af curve on a nonsingular quadric surface
observe that the case in which **zg is a Af curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet Aj
pencil in a plane containing a Af-fold secant of **zg has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in Af lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of **zg and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil
if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely Af
the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of this paper , we must reject the possibility that **zg is a Af curve on a quadric surface
the case in which **zg is a Af curve on a quadric Q , we first observe that the second regulus of Q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of **zg and the planes through any one of the multiple secants
of these lines meets Q in three points , namely two points on **zg and one point on one of the multiple secants
an arbitrary line , l , meeting Q in two points , Af and Af
is the multiple secant of **zg which passes through Af and **yb is the simple secant of **zg which passes through Af , and if Af are the points in which **ya meets **zg , and if Af is the image of Af on the generator **yb , it follows that the image of the line Af is Af
can expect to face difficult times
historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum , their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces , the gaps between rulers and subjects , town and country , will widen ; ; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence ; ; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction
will have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's sense of identity
a community of interest will have to be recreated -- in some of the new nations , indeed , they must be built for the first time -- on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past
with foresight and careful planning , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped
States can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible
goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face
same time , we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts
seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home
do what we can to discourage this conclusion , both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene
, we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development
nation , we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development ; ; but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community
When we look at countries like Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and Burma , where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital , and where institutions of centralized government exist , we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy
in power are committed in principle to modernization , but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically
have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern
is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector , with very poor communications between the two
impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted
in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective
rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals
period has generally left people believing that government can , if it wishes , provide all manner of services for them -- and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life
, in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; ; such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement
services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them ; ; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice , self-discipline , and competence
should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies
spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm
, we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their fates
the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance
to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see
assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments
encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities , state and provincial governments , rural communities , and other smaller groups , making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected
should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields , showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education , how health affects labor productivity , how small business can benefit the rural farm community , and , above all , how progress in each field relates to national progress
as the Community Development Program in the Philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development
this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account
programs are imposed from above , without the understanding and cooperation of the people , they will encounter grave difficulties
is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries
be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society
isolated policy , land reform is likely to be politically disruptive ; ; as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance
also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone
programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture
governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead
out prospects for external capital assistance , the United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth
societies At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth
continue to satisfy basic capital needs ; ; and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups
countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital ; ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels ; ; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies
economic front , the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources
tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved
must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy
in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years
drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward
must be coordinated with national needs and planning
a balance must be effected among project finance , utilization of agricultural surpluses , and general balance of payments support
although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange
many political and administrative problems to be solved
thing , although considerable numbers of men have been trained , bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects ; ; even the famed Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken
in training middle- and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases
also more basic problems
the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people
impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices
danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism
of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the West
based upon a single dominant party , governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest
the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead more rigid and inflexible in their policies
toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes
attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies
every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; ; we also have , in consequence , the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways
factor We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time
exception of treaty-making , foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration
now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection
free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition ; ; but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes , political institutions , and social structure which each society must generate
that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon
be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark
affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy , especially in the context of economic aid
: Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it
like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex
diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion
for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions
inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization , they have important indirect consequences
inner functions of religion are performed , the individual is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate ; ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ; he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows
several closely related inner functions
last analysis , religion is the means of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man's deepest experience -- the religious
first religious ; ; the instrumentalities follow
to satisfy human needs of great pertinence
things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self-pacification , and self-completion
experience is the sensing of communion , and in the higher religions , of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power
this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe
the experience of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand ; ; he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement
is a safe and permanent home
of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal
not permanent defeat and disappearance ; ; man has a second chance
not lost in the abyss of endless time ; ; he has endless being
its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit
summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideals and values -- ethical , aesthetic , and religious -- of man formed in his culture
also the possibility , among higher religions , of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness
of religious experience that most moderns seek not only provides , clarifies , and relates human yearnings , values , ideals , and purposes ; ; it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness
religious impulse , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy in living ; ; life leads somewhere
its best is out in front , ever beckoning and leading on , and , as Lippman put it , `` mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance ''
same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him
him aid , comfort , even solace , in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate
confronted with the recurrent crises , such as great natural catastrophes and the great transitions of life -- marriage , incurable disease , widowhood , old age , the certainty of death
to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie
beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern , and his religious faith makes possible fortitude , equanimity , and consolation , enabling him to endure colossal misfortune , fear , frustration , uncertainty , suffering , evil , and danger
also includes a principle of compensation , mainly in a promised perfect future state
in immortality , where held , functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here and now
accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession , repentance , and penance
of individual inferiority , defeat , or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God , as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith , and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies
for these inner individual functions , religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution
to the functions of religion within man , there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society
have never been separable
vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation
of a community or society is always correlated with , and to a degree dependent upon , a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions
supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values
the United States , with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation , there is a general consensus regarding the basic Christian values
demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere ; ; for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism
also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion
non-church members -- the freewheelers , marginal religionists and so on -- have the values of Christian civilization internalized in them
religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God to the intermediary and subordinate values ; ; for example , those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends
it gives sanctity , more than human legitimacy , and even , through super-empirical reference , transcendent and supernatural importance to some values ; ; for example , marriage as a sacrament , much law-breaking as sinful , occasionally the state as a divine instrument
certain values at least beyond questioning and tampering
to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends
leads to a conception of an over-all Social Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends ; ; for example , a plan that fulfills the will of God , which advances the Kingdom of God , which involves social life as part of the Grand Design
some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy
social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action
it gives meaning to much social endeavor , and logic , consistency , and meaning to life
, there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends
and unifies
the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion
have varied widely from mere families , primitive , totemic groups , and small modern cults and sects , to the memberships of great denominations , and great , widely dispersed world religions
group life in various ways
ultimate values , ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor
system of values there can be no society
a value system prevails , it always unifies all who possess it ; ; it enables members of the society to operate as a system
of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in creeds , dogmas , and doctrines , and form what Durkheim calls a credo
points out , a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo , and the more extensive the credo , the more unified and strong is the group
unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine ; ; the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine , the firmer the group
symbolism , and especially the closely related rites and worship forms , constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith
, in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large
codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together
ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior
are mechanism for training in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group
long ago that religion as `` a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things unites into one single moral community all those who adhere to them ''
is that every religion pertains to a community , and , conversely , every community is in one aspect a religious unit
brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the United States ; ; and it is evidenced in the prayers offered , in the frequent religious allusions , and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds
effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units , with religion as the dominant bond , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized
for 2500 years have been a prime example , though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion are cases in point
be pointed out that the integrating function of religion , for good or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings -- political , nationality , language , class , racial , sociability , even economic
exercises a stabilizing-conserving function
it acts as an anchor for the people
a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change , not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance
thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values , though also in some measure , an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones
to support the longstanding precious sentiments , the traditional ways of thinking , and the customary ways of living
has pointed out , the `` reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future ''
religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication , enforcement , sanction , and perpetuation of various other institutions
same time that religion exercises a conserving influence , it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups
the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives
ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force , mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices ; ; for example , the Crusades , mission efforts , just wars
has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion
reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects
the most attractive rewards , either in this world or the next , for those who not merely abide by its norms , but who engage in good works
acts as a powerful aid in social control , enforcing what men should or should not do
peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; ; and in modern societies such influence is still great
its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now
the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong
lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem
, dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated
B.'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family
care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short tempers reflected the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation
this was a family in crisis
compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mother's death when she was eight , as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying
traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday
anniversary of her father's death she poured out with agonized tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral
family's own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had `` reached the crisis peak -- either the situation will give or we will break ''
and acceptance of Mrs. B.'s anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears of annihilation
her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents , when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss , abandonment , and annihilation , produced further relief of tension
joint interview Mr. and Mrs. B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins
, accurately perceiving the child's needs , not only respected them as worthy of his attention , but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins , saying , `` I have a big lap ; ; there is room for you , too , Johnnie ''
a variety of environmental supports -- a calm but not too motherly homemaker , referral for temporary economic aid , intelligent use of nursing care , accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins' feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms
of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's day-to-day mental health and social functioning
in the B. family , there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance
of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety , often assuming the superficial guise of `` not knowing '' or `` not caring ''
use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled transference
, the approach is more active than passive , more out-reaching than reflective
regression is inevitable , it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy
an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness immediately , preferably within the first interview , by meeting the client's specific needs
usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension
interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking sense
relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem
doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact
the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf
is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation
preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue regression , unhealthy suppression and repression , excessive use of denial , and crippling guilt turned against the self
suppression and some denial are not only necessary but healthy , the worker's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used , what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated , and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed
the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive responses , the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques of specific emotional support , clarification , and anticipatory guidance
relatively short period of time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back and forth , between immediate external stressful exigencies ( `` precipitating stress '' ) and the key , emotionally relevant issues ( `` underlying problem '' ) which are , often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough , reactivated by the crisis situation , and hence once again amenable to resolution
is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments
too , the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits , single and group office interviews , and appropriate telephone follow-up calls , if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention
, in many cases , a variety of concrete social resources -- homemaker , day care , medical and financial aid -- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts
critical stages , and only for sound diagnostic reasons , it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating
in time and involving a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker ( in terms of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client's life ) , techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives
whatever the techniques used , a twin goal is common to all preventive casework service : to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities
an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : What place should brief , crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services
first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values , locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum , each important in its own right
is perhaps as old as social casework itself
decades ago Bertha Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services
has been borne out in the experience of many practitioners : `` short-contact interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work ''
casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended
are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature
is Levinger's finding that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of successful outcome
a number of studies , the important predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as well as the accessibility of the helping person
, the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project
significance , too , is the assertion that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated child guidance services
refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people
the approach which I have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship , quick appraisal of key issues , and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses
are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention , the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client's initial need for help
programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period of time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success
take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can withdraw ) is another prominent feature in these efforts
in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to `` wild therapy '' but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride
is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary -- or perhaps , in some instances , primary -- level , the place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number of investigators in a wide variety of settings
for example , has emphasized the `` need for a broad spectrum of services , including very brief services in connection with critical situations ''
brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance
the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available -- and on a more effective basis to more people
in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration with community planners
is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian
in the immediate future , we will have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models
with multipurpose agencies , especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare services , holds rich promise for the future
, child welfare experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships

and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling
the devices for tension management is preferential mating
mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study
geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating
seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society
relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation
building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship
remarks , `` In the internal pattern the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking , friendship , and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic relations ''

the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today
the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war
World War 2 , there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after World War 2

, as elements , refer to `` all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system ''
of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements
and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population
evidence `` it may be conjectured that core - core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and females ; ; core - marginal marriages still belong in the category of permissive unions ; ; and core - Negro marriages are proscribed for core members ''

of status-roles and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of conjectures about them

some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power , primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power , has been exerted on actors in the system , particularly in regard to mate selection
seem to vary from family to family , depending somewhat on the core or marginal `` status '' of that family
size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls

members of the Brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the ranking of the various families in the population
majority of the interviewees placed core families in the upper positions
ranking a product of the evaluation process
standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system ''
increasing rate of exogamous marriages , the population has been able to sustain , at least to some degree , the consciousness of its intermediate status in society
extent the system can be considered a Gemeinschaft in which `` social-role occupancies are determined by birth , by attributes such as sex or caste , which are biologically or socially immutable ''
of many in the population to the Indian background in their pedigree , and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestors had never been slaves , becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate status of the group in society

sanctions applied to core - Negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected adherence to group norms
because of Church laws , lately more stringently enforced , which forbid the marriage of cousins closely related consanguineously , a means of facilitating the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate unions
survey of available material indicates a high rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship
comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems
larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems
subsystem , consisting of relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts , includes : 1
various types , interconnected by relational norms

various types , within the larger system and within the subgroups 3
governing subgroups and roles


study of marriage patterns for this group , consanguinity produces the structural system -- a system of affinities -- which , in turn , maintains the system of consanguinity
various types have been found within this system
line can be considered a substructure
to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group
the proscription of core - Negro marriages for core families , discussed above , would seem to act as a regulative norm governing subgroups and roles
of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the subgroups
it cannot be presumed , informal though the structure of the population seems , that there are not well-defined roles within the system
study relates to the theory of functional systems
hypothesized that fertility is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division of core families and marginal families is considered
functional problems of a social system are , to some extent , solved by the subsystems within this population
of geographical isolation and high fertility rates , inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained
to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension , the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection , and the clustering of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls
their intermediate position in the larger society , it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible '' , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate , distinct grouping or system in society
above , where families are concentrated in larger numbers , group controls seem strongest and most effective
the social and non-social environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational segregation
the necessary contact with the larger society , while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts
has to do with the inter-relation of parts ''
of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values
placed by the Brandywine population , upon maintaining a certain homogeneity , a certain separate racial identity , and therefore a certain separate social status , are important for the morale of the system
is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration , the higher the morale and solidarity , the better the system can solve the problems of the system
respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within the same general locality , the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population
conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation
, higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population , allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity
can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger
Of particular utility in the analysis of the development , persistence , and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes
six such processes in his paradigm

undoubtedly all six processes are operative within the whole social system and its subsystems , two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be singled out for particular emphasis

the process of communication , Loomis defines it as `` the process by which information , decisions , and directives are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge , opinions , and attitudes are formed , or modified by interaction ''
be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger community
is easier where segregated living and occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community , as in the case of this population
the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation
Brandywine population is still predominantly rural , `` there are indications of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities
to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group
is , however , an over-simplification
realistic analysis must take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the urban-fringe area are , in general , less segregated locally than group members in rural areas
urban area , in other words , they , unlike some urban ethnic groups , do not concentrate in ghetto colonies
toward conformity are slight or non-existent , and deviant behavior in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions
a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous , resulting in a change of values and , almost necessarily , in mate selection behavior
extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential isolation , to that extent it contributes directly to increased exogamy ''

of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play a part in the individual's behavior , as well as the group's behavior
of this social control , deviance is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group
this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned by ostracism from the group

an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society
divided though this tradition may be , it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group , and acts as a means of socialization , particularly for members of the rural community
of Indian ancestry and `` free '' status during the days of slavery , are important distinctions made by members of the group

induced social cohesion resulting from common norms and values internalized by members of the group '' is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of socialization
of boundary maintenance identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems , and the characteristic interaction is maintained
threat of encroachment on the system increases , the `` probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases ''
rate pattern would seem to be a function , though a latent one , of the process of maintaining the boundary
boundary maintenance may be achieved , for example , by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern
external pattern or external system can be considered as `` group behavior that enables the group to survive in its environment
maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social , as is the preference for endogamy
also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the matter of endogamy , particularly in rural areas
pattern of endogamy and exogamy , the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain

maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group , systemic linkage is defined `` as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit
decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms
along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919
a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered
procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors
set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time
system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933
for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la Main-d'Oeuvre ( AIMO , Af Direction , Af Direction Generale , Gouvernement Generale )
, the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials
officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics
require the inscription of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( fiche )
, filed by circonscription ( sub-chiefdom , or village ) , are kept in the headquarters of each territoire ( chiefdom )
is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned , including his or her date of birth ( or age at a specified time ) , spouses , and children
must be made from time to time
are used for males and females , and a corner is clipped from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach puberty
quick count could be made at any time , even by an illiterate clerk , of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes
cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments , inoculations , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded
cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females
is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand
card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons
of permanent out-migrants are , in theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence
the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions
registered persons in four age-and-sex classes were counted each year
, demographic inquiries , supposedly involving field investigations , were conducted in selected minor divisions ( circonscriptions ) containing about 3 percent of the total population
of these inquiries were used to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts , including birth and death rates , general fertility rates , distributions by marital status , fertility of wives separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households , infant mortality , and migration
to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials , supposedly as representative of a larger population
the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population
, in theory , is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions of African life
places a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already burdened in other ways ) of a widely dispersed , poor and largely illiterate population
program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies
was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers
between domiciled ( de jure ) and present ( de facto ) population was not clearly defined
results are subject to considerable confusion
tended to break down during the war , but was reactivated ; ; it had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951
of the defects in this system , the figures on total population during the late 1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity
information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading
system , with minor modifications , was developed in Ruanda-Urundi under Belgian administration
it seems that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods
more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of demography in Belgian Africa
of strong independent agencies , established in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conducted large medical , social , educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi
of Fonds Reine Elisabeth pour l'Assistance Medicale aux Indigenes Du Congo Belge ( FOREAMI ) has special interest with respect to demography
accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from 638,560 persons in 1941 to 840,503 in 1956 in the Kwango District and adjacent areas east of Leopoldville
from 1941 on , its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and , as its primary objective , the incidence of major diseases
are reported each year in its Rapport Sur l'activite Pendant annee ( Bruxelles )
investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas
, or partially independent agencies , have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography
vary widely in scope and precision
La Recherche Scientifique En Afrique Centrale ( IRSAC ) has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has cooperated closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development of its official statistics
investigation of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J. J. Maquet , former Director of the Social Science branch of IRSAC , now a professor at l'Universite Officielle Du Congo Belge et Du Ruanda-Urundi
completed schedules with 20 items ( collected by sub-chiefs in 1,100 circumscriptions ) have been tabulated
are now being analyzed
been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs
organizations of both countries , which maintain administrative services throughout the territories , retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information
the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics
De La Demographie ( A. Romaniuk , Director ) was formed under AIMO in the Congo , to work in close rapport with the Section Statistique of the Secretariat General
for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office
demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V. Neesen , a member of the IRSAC staff , though the inquiry was carried out under the auspices of AIMO , which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory
of the IRSAC staff ( E. Van De Walle ) was recently delegated to cooperate with AIMO in the development of demographic statistics in this territory
of sampling censuses in Ruanda-Urundi ( 1952 ) and in the Congo ( 1955 - 57 ) were major advances
deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into operation later than the other
nature of the innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official announcements
enquetes demographiques , previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative censuses , was used for the new investigations
the differences in procedure are fundamental
as follows : ( 1 ) field work procedures
were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time African investigators ( three teams , each working in two provinces )
carried out the same operations successively in different areas
) nature of the sample
in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory , so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits
, scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling
of the various districts , or other major divisions , were stratified by type of community ( rural , urban , mixed ) and , where appropriate , by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy
( villages in rural areas , houses in cities ) were drawn systematically within these strata
) size of the sample
ratios were applied under different conditions
were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas
percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries
) questions and definitions
, definitions , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country
obtained , separately , on three classes of persons : ( A ) residents , present ; ; ( B ) residents , absent ; ; and ( C ) visitors
reports , summary results are given for both the de facto ( A and C ) and de jure ( A and B ) populations ; ; but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de jure population ( or , in some districts , only the de facto population )
represent , in effect , a shift from ( 1 ) an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to ( 2 ) a systematic sampling census of the whole African population
registration system still has important functions
local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations
a frame for the sampling census
provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force ( though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this source in the near future )
still used in making current population estimates in post-census years , though the value of these estimates is open to question
it may have certain very important , less obvious values
the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and supplementary information ( such as records of marital status ) for many others
of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries
it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method ( as distinguished from sampling error ) in each of these sources , on such subjects as fertility , mortality , and migration during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction
sampling census in the Congo extended over a three-year period , 1955 - 57 ; ; the results were still being processed in 1959
planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more expeditiously
proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses be carried out at five-year intervals
issued on the sampling census , 1955 - 57 , in various areas run as follows ( using only the French and omitting corresponding Flemish titles )
contains preliminary notes and 35 tables
in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued
reports will be followed , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods
evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes
end of the semester's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length
, as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students
all admitted that the `` hindsight '' was not altogether lost
own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time
, they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some `` hindsight '' study ; ; but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent
them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course
were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students
of them expressed it , `` It has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these not-yet-married people
now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past
been in an all-married section I would have missed this , and I believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me ''
and others similar to it , would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status quo
weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction
the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married -- that is , prerequisite : `` marriage ''
not mean that married students could not enroll in other `` mixed '' sections , and some of them , largely because of scheduling difficulties , did
those already married could enroll in this one section
, two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted
) The regular sections do not allow freshmen ; ; this one did
was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores
them appear to drop out , for one reason or another
freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it
subsequently been verified by the experience
) Auditors were encouraged
regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged
has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively
auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students
this one section we welcomed auditors

particular reason , other than that the writer felt it might -- just might -- encourage both mates to be in attendance
the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum , especially in the various engineering fields , with few electives till the senior year
it needs to be noted that because auditors were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week , until at last it swelled to such proportions that this `` free '' auditing policy had to be retracted
, we began to get `` visitors '' to class
class represented quite a variety of students
from a freshman woman , just married , through the various academic growth stages , including one senior-graduate student , to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended
from those with no children , through students in various stages of pregnancy , to one 44-year-old male with four children , three of whom were teenagers
from two women members who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive
digress at this point and speculate that if it is `` wise '' to create special sections for special status , then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage , and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children , and so on
these speculations may have some merit , others are somewhat ambiguous
who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation
began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place
it clear from the beginning that this was the students' opportunity , and that the future destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one
build a framework of academic `` respectability '' , and one which did not encroach upon the `` sacred sovereignty '' of any other existing campus course
to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods , nor a course in how to raise children
have courses covering those problems , and so on
that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible
committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate the direction and pace the class was taking
, being cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students , did insist on there being included some `` hindsight '' material
greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes : `` So we are married -- now how do we make the best of it ''
How do we enrich our already fine marriage ''
used , as with all sections , but with one big difference
, unfortunately , owns no films
are all either rented or borrowed , the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance
never knew from week to week just where the section might be
, the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched
writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision -- after , of course , pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one
films seen as they came in ( coordinated for the regular sections ) , were often out of context
the writer has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion after film showings
did not become known to the writer for some time , a nucleus group had sprung up within the class
to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class
few students this group gradually increased to include over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class , and many outsiders as well
although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning , most reported that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of that class
, they often revamped their social activities to include class members previously unknown
reading reports were handled just as in the other sections , the major difference being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group
, although they might read various articles in popular magazines , more often chose to report on articles found in the journals
to the noticeable difference in outside articles , there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read
high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest
writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as a matter of fact , in those who were continuing in `` single sections '' , he can only conclude that there must have been something `` contagious '' within the specific group which caused this to occur
main , this course took the following directional high roads
) A great deal of time was spent on processes for solving marital differences
not a search for a `` magic formula '' , but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage
, it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy
the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to ( 2 ) , Specific adjustment areas , such as sex , in-laws , religion , finance , and so on
they proceeded to ( 3 ) These same areas in relation to their own future family life stages , developing these to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to confront them at some time or other
example of this last facet , there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement
were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward , but the possible death of one's own spouse was not overlooked
course , one member has lost her husband
not a particularly shocking or unexpected thing -- it was previously known to her that it might happen
when was an unknown , and of course the longer it did not happen , the stronger her wish and belief that it might not
bereavement this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis
class members brought questions from their mates at home
often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them
a personal zest to class discussions and participation
reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely enlightening
sensed a much freer and more frank discussion , especially of this one area , than ever before
certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that orgasm , as a criterion , is not nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think
probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again
other hand , the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with love as most women seem to do
reproductive area it could be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students had previously in `` mixed '' marital status sections
was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent
other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various stages of pregnancy
a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented , from a childless couple to and including every trimester
, we had one birth before the end of the course , and another student had to take the final examiantion a week early , just to be on the safe side
also one spontaneous abortion during the semester
is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief `` structuring '' experience
predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of what the ambiguous figure `` looked like '' as reflecting their hesitancy about taking chances
true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action
as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic
inventories
personality inventories ( Guilford ; ; Guilford-Martin ; ; Guilford-Martin ) were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects
the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test
had been made concerning factors R , N , I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity
differentiated between the two groups at less than the 5% level ( Af )
had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not
had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably `` secure '' nonreactors and `` secure '' reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies
predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the `` Inferiority '' factor
the subjects in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups ( as defined for purposes of the personality studies ) were compared with those subjects who shifted in Conditions 3 , or 4
test on these two groups , shifters vs. nonshifters , gave a `` t '' value of 2.405 which is significant on the two-tail test at the level
differences Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study
( 11 subjects ) gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon
49% ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration
24% ( 10 subjects ) who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured as to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction
latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred
changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax
( 12% ) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm , what that something was , and also were given a demonstration
( 10% ) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed while others did not
time was it implied by the experimenter that the subject's initial reaction was deviant
were only given information about other possibilities of `` normal '' reaction
responded with an arm-elevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion
was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing it
implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried
Kohnstamm reactivity in Condition 1 ( ( the naive state ) is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility ( if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal cues )
way , either verbally or behaviorally , did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary contraction
when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed , the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation
to give an arm-elevation
suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their naive Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion
the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own expectations of the outcome ( i.e. , that the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that `` to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction '' ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happening ( e.g. , of becoming dizzy and maybe falling , an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the subjects )
Hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of `` normal '' reactions different from those which they gave
were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had , they were also informed that there were other normals who reacted as they had
no implication made that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of levitation
tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax , since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as `` normal ''
state , Condition 1 , , could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting one for 24% of the subjects in this study
not free to be themselves in this situation , an interpersonal one , where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior
relax , i.e. , to be `` spontaneous '' , and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have , was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given
conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior
succeeded in changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject ( the only one with whom this technique was tried )
, who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years , did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions used in this experiment while sober
drinks containing alcohol , her arm flew upward very freely
evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement
herself as having the same kind of `` irresponsible '' feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis
her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls
attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control -- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it
interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had
subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control
its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors
that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction
those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors -- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily
spontaneously asked ( after her arm had finally risen ) , `` Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before ''
that her arm did not go up at first `` because I wouldn't let it ; ; I thought it wasn't supposed to ''
was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first
felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial , but had consciously prevented it from so doing
nonreactivity of others by saying that they were `` not letting themselves relax ''
that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up , she commented , `` I don't see how they can prevent it ''
to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects , the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity
that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level
discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in abeyance in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects ; ; but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation
subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows : `` You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to happen ''
described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she relinquished control
she was able to relax and yield to the moment
our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; ; that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors
our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below
this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor
The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world
a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline
in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill
that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the aniseikonic lenses
were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be
in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects , after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions , suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations
able to experience at first , in terms of past conventionality
as to the various possibilities of normal reactions , they were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present
be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong ; ; that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as `` threatening '' until they are tested and proved otherwise
interpretations that have been given are inferences only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the tilt illusion
socioeconomic status It would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated : the degree of structure in teaching method
schools were in an industrial city , with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas , but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes
schools were in a large suburban community , predominantly middle- to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area
to equate the samples on socioeconomic status , we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods
and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas
scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data
of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods
differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement
third-grade children were chosen as subjects for this study
of sample selection only ( individual tests were given later ) we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade population in each school system
for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution , one-third as underachievers , one-third medium , and one-third over-achievers
reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total third-grade school population were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection
at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system
sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores
in twelve unstructured schools furnished 156 cases , 87 boys and 69 girls
in three structured schools furnished 72 cases , 36 boys and 36 girls
necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools
assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation
of compulsivity An interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared , and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home
was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self and others , irrational conformity to rules , orderliness , punctuality , and need for certainty
were instructed not to suggest answers and , as much as possible , to record the parents' actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations
scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records , categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity , then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records
were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms
high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations , or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals
compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters
, the following statement was rated low in compulsivity , `` She's naturally quite neat about things , but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy
cleans it up very well when I remind her ''
anxiety Castaneda , et al revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for use with children
Scale was adapted from the Minnesota Multiphastic Personality Inventory , with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety
much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees
validation work with the Children's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda , et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale
Taylor Scale was designed as a group testing device , in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items
Anxiety to compulsivity The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity
ratings yield a correlation of , which is not significantly different from zero ; ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics
, compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety , and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer
of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later
In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years
criterion measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself
interaction effect should , if potent , extend its influence over all academic achievement
Achievement Test , Form J , was administered by classroom teachers , consisting of a battery of six sub-tests : Paragraph Meaning , Word Meaning , Spelling , Language , Arithmetic Computation , and Arithmetic Reasoning
these sub-tests involve reading except Arithmetic Computation
stated in grade-equivalents on a national norm
median grade-equivalent was used in data analysis in this study
Intelligence Scale For Children was administered to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker
of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact ( in this case , Af ) ; ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor
score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement
the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the I.Q.
, on the basis of the regression equation , a child with an I.Q. of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 4.8 ( grade equivalent )
child with an I.Q. of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement , his discrepancy score would be , representing of one year of over-achievement
with an I.Q. of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score of 3.5
a child scored 3.0 , his discrepancy score would be -.5 , representing of one year of under-achievement
manner , the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled , allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables
of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable
portrays the mean achievement scores of each sub-group graphically
all , as we had surmised , the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better ( Af ) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools
be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools , the high compulsive children do better ( Af )
difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school
of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case , at the level
had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives
achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant
that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting , but that their need to organize ( for comfort ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment
interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores ( although not significantly lower )
compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure
is , then , that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught , the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work
by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation , then , and only then , does such a child attain unusual success
interaction of anxiety and teaching methods The statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the two are presented in Tables 3 and 4
is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group
, the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( Af ) than those in the structured schools
effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores
anxiety children achieve significantly less well ( Af ) in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children , they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom
striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools
the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment
that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit
with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols , the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem
the threat , and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult , so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced
with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination
symbols he is asked to learn are simple
earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements
the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved
time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words
challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked
al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like situation , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher
present study was not a direct replication of their investigations , the results do not confirm their conclusion
in the two school systems studied here , judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting
highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting
means the evaluation of subparts , the comparative ratings of parts , the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements
roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts
Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals
be done for quite a different purpose : to evaluate procedures , regardless of individuals
: a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying
us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis
keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas
president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business
checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high
his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired -- and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed
offered as a solution -- and the procedure worked as follows : all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room , where the president explained the difficulty he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out
of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires , checking their references , interviewing them , asking them to be tried out , he told them he would prefer to test them
was to enter the testing room , carrying a suitcase of samples
was to read a sheet containing a description of the product
testing room he was to make , successively , three presentations to three different people
testing room , three of the veteran salesmen served as antagonists
the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a hesitating manner
told to purchase material if he felt like it
came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other presentations
presentation , the antagonist wrote his judgment of the salesmen ; ; and so did the observers consisting of the president , three of his salesmen and a psychologist
were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon
was repeated one day a month for four months
average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three
of the firm , calculating expenses alone , felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent
for the value of this procedure was simply that the applicants were tested `` at work '' in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant owners and managers
, in a sense , `` tried out '' in realistic situations
point of view of the applicants , less time was wasted in being evaluated -- and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances
of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work
of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions
were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist
end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one at a time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes
was independently `` tested '' by the personnel man , and he served not only as the director , but as the antagonist and the observer
his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist , showing wit , sparkle , and aplomb
hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day
considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning
in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure
had been made the works manager of a firm , supplanting a retired employee who had been considered outstandingly successful
had more than seven years of experience in the firm , was well trained , was considered a hard worker , was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a `` comer ''
he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position
to antagonize everyone
of personnel went up , production dropped , and morale was visibly reduced
fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer , he seemed to be a very poor administrator , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him
insistence of his own supervisor -- the president of the firm -- he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders
a number of typical situations before observers , other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong
with efficiency , he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes , condemning them to too great an extent
not really listen to others , had little interest in their ideas , and wanted to have his own way -- which was the only right way
group of managers explained , in great detail , a number of human relations errors that he made
one , these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors
his behavior , and defended it
to change his approach , and instead he attacked high and low -- the officials for their not backing him , and subordinates for their laxness , stupidity , and stubbornness
diagnosing , he left the course , convinced that it could do him no good
say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment
turned works manager had a particular view of life -- and refused to change it
say that his attitude was foolish , since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills ; ; or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others
case , he refused to accept the implications of the analysis , that he needed to be made over
may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis , and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis
course for supermarket operators , a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager , found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time
some typical situations before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory
told he displayed , for example , a sense of superiority -- and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers , aren't I ''
criticized for his curtness and abruptness -- and he answered : `` I am not working to become popular ''
criticized for his arbitrary behavior -- he answered : `` I have to make decisions
job ''
, as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and defends himself
in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways
step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms
was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem
helped tailor-make a check list of the district manager's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences commenting on the mistakes they felt he made
were then collected and written on a blackboard , condensing similar ideas
were located , and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors
asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; ; and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain
sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up , and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard
were made during the voting
looked as follows : Af
eight of these eighteen statements , which received at least one-half of the votes , were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager , and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations , the members checked any items that appeared
the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions , they were rather lengthy ( about twenty minutes ) , the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect , new antagonists were brought on the scene unexpectedly , and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticized
session , the check marks were totaled up and graphed , and in this way the supervisor's progress was charted
life we learn to play our roles and we `` freeze '' into patterns which become so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do
see others more clearly than we can see ourselves , and others can see us better than we see ourselves
what we do is the first step for improvement
the validity of the judgments of others is the second step
to change is the third step
new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step
these new ways in daily life is the last step
for analysis follows these general steps leading to training
evaluative situation is set up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation
see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion
is more `` veridical '' -- or true -- than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning
for testing is not too well understood at the present time , it represents one of the major uses of this procedure
, spontaneity training the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts
, the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed
will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area
for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold

theory is unique and relatively new
not easy for the therapist to discern when , in the patient's communicating , an introject has appeared and is holding sway
to become alert to changes in his vocal tone -- to his voice's suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one , a quality which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances , parrot-like
of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition , as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove ; ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom , common to our culture , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent until he experiences it as part of him
woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her
incidents became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior , and in one particular session , after several minutes of such behavior -- which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words from her -- she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny ''
I did not know what she meant ; ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother , in their distant home-city
realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time , what Granny was like ; ; and when I replied in this spirit , she corroborated my hunch
phase in the therapy , when a pathogenic mother-introject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene , she muttered in a low but intense voice , to herself , `` I hate that woman inside me ''
evoke no further elaboration from her about this ; ; but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me , looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone , `` Your father despises you ''
I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication , and I quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction , of an opinion held by my father , now several years deceased
replied , coldly , `` If you despise me , why don't you say so , directly ''
confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make
occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman told you ''
agreed that this had been the case
, now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way , something her mother had once said to her ; ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her
been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like
this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice
less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine , who used to often seclude herself in her room , often sounded through the closed door -- as I would find on passing by , between our sessions -- for all the world like two persons , a scolding mother and a defensive child
for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome
found , time and again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient's behavior
, one hebephrenic man used to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion -- as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank you '' to him at the end of each session
became clear to me , partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly , that this man , with his condescending , `` You're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor , over these months , on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note , each time , that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow
, a paranoid woman , for many months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building , as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met
on her part subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between , on the one hand , her arranging the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking , or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others , and on the other hand , my own coming stolidly into her room despite her persistent and vociferous objections , bringing my big easy chair with me , usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state , and plunking myself down in my chair -- in short , behaving as if I owned her room


variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement
, for example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression , seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention , reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings , and the most unconventional of meanings
anything , it is the therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck of cards , on sporadic occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together
assume , of course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later on when the stereotype was uttered ; ; probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a well-grooved , stereotyped mode of expression -- and no , or but a few , other communicational grooves , as yet -- being there , available for the patient's use , as newly-emerging emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months
is true that the therapist can sense , when he hears this stereotype , that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another
is not a verbal stereotype -- a `` How are you now ''
`` I want to go home '' , or whatever -- but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning
man used to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his largely-silent hours with his therapist
therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill -- hello or farewell ''
patient replied , `` Both , Dearie -- two in one ''
the possible forms of nonverbal expression , that which seems best to give release , and communicational expression , to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter
no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms , laughter -- laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair ; ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words , words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another
much less full extent , the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus has a comparable communicative function ; ; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch , or the passage of flatus , not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute forms of communication in which , from time to time , quite different things are being said , long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings and concepts , to say them in words
have been intimating , in the schizophrenic -- and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic ; ; this is a question which I have no wish to take up -- condensation is a phenomenon in which one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas which are , at an unconscious level , well sorted out , but rather a condensed expression of feelings and ideas which , even in the unconscious , have yet to become well differentiated from one another
Cameron and McGhie , in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients , say , in regard to condensation , that `` the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment , and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation ''
experience , a great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience
may be referring to some concrete thing , or incident , in his immediate environment by some symbolic-sounding , hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene
for example , a paranoid woman's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid-twentieth-century human culture , developed itself , before the end of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was
equally often , a concretistic-seeming , particularistic-seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry -- may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a smile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking
hidden meanings the patient himself is , more often than not , entirely unaware
experience may be a remarkably concretistic one
women confided to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; ; Burnham , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic communication , includes mention of similar clinical material
schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding , in a most articulate fashion , during session after session with me , were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him ; ; as he spoke I was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung , high in the air , from a docked steamship
linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc.
reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian
the reduction in size is less striking
requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word
scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file
the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis
the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem
, we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ; occurrence -- an instance of a form in text
a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text
this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer
scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text-form list
found to match forms in the text list are marked
in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; ; dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text
information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process -- the grammatical description for sentence-structure determination , equivalent-choice information for semantic analysis , and target-language equivalents for output construction
is a form dictionary , at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries
the dictionary is divided into at least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms
detailed description of dictionary operations -- text lookup and dictionary modification -- gives a clearer picture
, as we will describe it , consists of three steps
is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence
step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list ; ; cells in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information cells for text forms
occurrence Af is isolated during text reading , a random memory address Af , the address of a cell in the X-region , is computed from the form of Af
denote the form of Af
Af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of Af
itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell Af
Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af ; ; the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence
continues with the next occurrence
assume that Af is identical to the form of an occurrence Af which preceded Af in the text
situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af
was assigned as the information cell for Af , the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af
Af is stored in the cell Af
as in this case , the two forms match , the address Af is saved to represent the occurrence Af
continues with the next occurrence
situation is possible
for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form
when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form
leads to an address Af that is equal to the address computed from Af , even though Af does not match Af , the chain of information cells is extended from Af by storing the address of the next available cell in the Y-region , Af , in Af
Af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of Af
cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af ; ; similarly , as many cells are added as are required
cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored
except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain ; ; the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain
when the address Af is computed from Af , the cell Af and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether Af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain
information cell for Af has been determined , it is saved as a representation of Af
continues with the next occurrence
is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list
the second step of glossary lookup -- connecting the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms
represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list
a dictionary form matches a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved
of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved
pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage
text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read
action for handling these forms can be taken at that time
form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading
address Af that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form
Af is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to Af each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored
form is compared with each of these text forms
match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage
Af is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list
steps essentially complete the lookup operation
step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text
of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and Y-regions are no longer required
assignment of the information cells is important
stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text
description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis
of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence
descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file
is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe
are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer
process takes place as the file is read
that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj
of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form
address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage
the complete file has been read , the grammatical descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; ; the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents
the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence
requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms
the ordering of entries variable
an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it
very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form
is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage
is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents
techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once
of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form
be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context
one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form
forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible
, the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached
, the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings
full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list
if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form
system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it
and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail
summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased
, patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here
is toward putting dominant stress at the end
a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes
first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows
charge to keep I have , A God to glorify ''
tune to which this hymn is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables have and fy , ending their lines , have twice the time any other syllables have
is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last
parallel is significant
answer to what's wrong now
broken a chair , dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair
point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken , and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking ; ; but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence
know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; ; in one thing I know it will usually be on the predicator know
people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly ; ; in the double sentence the smaller the town , the friendlier the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people
a linguist
will generally be on the subject a linguist ; ; in who's a linguist
generally be on the complement a linguist
is on her luggage both in that's her luggage , where her luggage is the complement , and in there's her luggage , where it is the subject
complements , however , are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences
answer to what was that noise
put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out
may or may not have dominant stress
answer to what was that noise
reads the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally
complements are divided as in what are you looking for
likely to lose dominant stress
of extreme importance
new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not
a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new , dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here , but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow , dominant stress will probably be on snows
pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context
go with George dominant stress is probably on George ; ; but if George has just been mentioned prominently ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably I'll go with him , and dominant stress is probably on the preposition with
gesture accompanies who's he
pronoun has dominant stress because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously
George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling George is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George
what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress or no stress at all
unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows : nothing can snow snow but `` it ''
aren't many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young takes dominant stress away from its head people : the fact that the young creatures of interest are people seems rather obvious
replaced people , it would normally have dominant stress
have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do
is substituted for things ( with more exact contribution to meaning ) , it will have dominant stress
know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing
knew you when you were a child , and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty
on pretty would be almost insulting here
written language then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here , but much of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness , and a careless reader will have to back up and reread
dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion
it's incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress also
has it in for George dominant stress will ordinarily be on in , where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to center
painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting
is comparison or contrast , dominant stresses normally operate to center attention
his friends are stranger than his sisters' strong stresses are normal for his and sisters' , but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters
hurting himself more than he's hurting you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast
she Chinese or Japanese
to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns of stress of Chinese and Japanese
stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship
Mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on Mary marks Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip , strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of Mary's concerned with an account of her trip ( about which she may later have made speeches , for example ) , and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which Mary wrote accounts
stimulates man too the situation is very similar
on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus , strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger , strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger
, in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics , but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context
word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part , it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction
yes , I have is the response to have you finished reading the paper
on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper , is quite strong
the leader at camp , but Jack is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader and therefore has stress
leader at camp , but Jack's here , with this is deprived of stress , makes here the complement in the clause
all the suggestions that were made , his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion and is stressed
represents itself and a complement ( being equivalent , say , to go to Martinique ) in which boat did Jack go on
strong stress ; ; when it represents only itself and on which is its complement ( so that go on is semantically equivalent to board ) , on has stronger stress than go does
a subordinator pronoun , however , does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object
has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to
to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that I came to , and similarly in that was the moment I came to , there is much stronger stress on to
wanted to tell him , but I was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him
tell him , of course , to is normally unstressed
have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions that I am to leave this place , dominant stress is ordinarily on leave
same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave , dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions
clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written
follow
come by Tuesday
be happy long without drinking water ''
first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and Tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on Tuesday , there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language ; ; but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most
second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless I drink water , there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking ; ; but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking , there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water
use of stress in comparison and contrast , for example , can undermine distinctions such as these
of stress are not always unambiguous by any means
Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them , and in I looked up the number and I looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second

are linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and/or following consonants or combinations of consonants
genuine units , but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties
the number of syllables is not clear
this point is strongest before /l/ and AAb/ or /r/
point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables
is the formative that is employed also in republic , and al is the common suffix
is added , real clearly has two syllables
is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable , and because of the fact that /l/ commonly has the quality of AAb/ when it follows vowel sounds , deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with deal
obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels
explanation is adequate to account for this
however , is urgent , and at least three things will be needed
is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses
students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems , both in their general outlines and in many specific details
student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems , including some of the more unusual types
, even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages
familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone
will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist
these four , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work
need is better field techniques
majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter
has been neglect , fumbling efforts , or superficial treatment
maladies overlap , so must the cure
as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple
give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures
techniques will not only equip linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes
none of these papers says much directly about field techniques
is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics
have been disseminated by other means , but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results
need is for better theory
expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels , but it has not been
only be for one of two reasons : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory ( and hence techniques ) , or our existing theories are insufficiently general
as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems
that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems
systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis
does not often work out this way
are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal systems
suggested one explanation
use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use
both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable
is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features
, something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology : consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component
general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude
, individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them
from one speaker to another , or from one emotional state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones
any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone , or in developing a realistic attitude about tone , but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded
explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' paper
intonation often become seriously intermeshed
be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other
of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way ; ; for example , duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation
features , for example glottal catch or murmur , are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual systems
other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages
of tone difficulties , however , does not apply in all languages
( the Ewe type mentioned above ) interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation spans
of the syllables , intonation can be safely ignored , and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation
even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect
explanation is suggested by Richardson's analysis of Sukuma tone
see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system
phonemes can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to morphemic units , i.e. until the morphophonemics is worked out , or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success
`` typical tone language '' , tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics
systems which must support these morphophonemic systems , however , are very different
of tones is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension , pitch level
are not merely larger , they are multidimensional
may be thought of as joining certain points in the system
in the consonantal system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used
by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system
, in a common case , can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone
are few , and the total number of rules may be considerably greater
therefore , there are a number of rules having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules as well , having the opposite effect
is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules is no greater
of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse function of the size -- smaller systems are more troublesome -- for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity
will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems
of the system is a different matter
can of course be stated much more succinctly
system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics
more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics -- at least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures
of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves
been a tendency on the part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance
naive
have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies
feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs
of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic ' esthetics ' , which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried over from European languages
the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent
not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater significance
result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion
Sharp , in Vowel-Length And Syllabicity In Kikuyu , examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail
is merely to determine `` what distinctions of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography '' ( 59 )
so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail
process , he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult
of his examples are of very great interest , and the whole discussion of some importance for theory
recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other
weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness
that some changes can be made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes
his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles
however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design
many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis
paper deals with a phonologic problem : Vowel Harmony In Igbo , by J. Carnochan
the already widely known facts in terms of prosodies
restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of Igbo
would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology
has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement
show one feature of the system that has not been previously described
does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods
to me that it rather easily can
the papers deal with grammatical problems
whole they maintain much the same high standard , but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter
must be briefer than the papers deserve
Whiteley writes on The Verbal Radical In Iraqw
be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A Short Description Of Item-Categories In Iraqw
much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms
seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex , largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point
more stems per item in Athabascan , which expresses the fact that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts
be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ; or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ; or both
, however , is not very much greater , as shown by the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 2.75 for Yokuts , with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample : 24 as against 21
deduction of one-eighth from 3.46 , the stem / item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number of languages
general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison
difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used
in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined
short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal ; ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley
is that I included 70 animal names , but Swadesh only 4 ; ; and somewhat similarly for plants , 16 as against 4
and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( ox , vulture , salmon , yellow pine , manzanita ) ; ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root )
are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size
are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives )
have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ; ( 2 ) Nature ( 29 terms against 17 ) , ratios 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ; ( 3 ) adjectives ( 16 , 15 terms ) , ratios 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ; ( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios 4.0 versus 3.4
be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower
may be connected with Hoijer's use of a much higher percentage of verbs : 22% of his total list as against 3.5% in mine
exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb
class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question

classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually
and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly , big-large , long-far , many-much , die-dead , say-speak )
, I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems
for these five categories are not too uneven , namely 20 , 15 , 11 , 16 , 9 respectively
, with a greater range of stems , the first two of five corresponding columns were identical , 1 and 2 stems ; ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively Af ; ; Af ; ; and Af stems
particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially arbitrary , they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material , and they eventuate also in five classes , along a similar scale , containing approximately equal numbers of cases , namely 19 , 14 , 15 , 11 , 12 in Athabascan
we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : Af
can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart : Af ; ; which , divided by Af gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart
distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families , the distance would of course be 0
were wholly random and unrelated , it would be 2.0 , assuming the five classes were equal in n , which approximately they are
mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement

, David D. Thomas published Basic Vocabulary In some Mon-Khmer Languages ( AL 2 , No. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( Af ) in place of original ( Af ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy ( IJAL 21 : : 121 - 137 )
are , first , `` that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence '' ; ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence '' ( as between M-K and I-E )
conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok. ) was partially positive
conclusion , on semantic word classes , agrees with mine
conclusion , independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored
presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency
persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning are : stem identical in 8 languages , 100% ; ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86% ; ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64% ; ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57%
will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material
of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; ; and Gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area
relative frequencies of competing roots ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc. ) , Thomas with his ' weighting ' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have
needs further exploration
at least conscious of the distinction in my full Yokuts presentation that awaits publication , in which , in listing ' Two-Stem Meanings ' , I set off by asterisks those forms in which N of stem B was Af of stem A/3 , the unasterisked ones standing for Af ; ; or under ' Four Stems ' , I set off by asterisks cases where the combined N of stems Af was Af

, and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry
meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly
substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller
of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones
evident that Swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items
this urge to include unstable items in his basic list
the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible
that insistence
the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence
is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare
such a list cannot be constructed ; ; but the nearer it comes to attaining universality , the less significant will it be linguistically
will tend to be labile or vague , and they will fit actual languages more and more badly
operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison
important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible
as meanings are concrete , we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive
or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth or nail
out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence ; ; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities
universal list as his weapon , Swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past , eight , ten , twelve millennia back
has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all Western hemisphere languages
this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence
farther out he moves , the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence , and the larger the speculative component in his inferences
traversed provinces and kingdoms , but he has not consolidated them behind him , nor does he control them
announced results on Hokan , Penutian , Uto-Aztecan , and almost all other American families and phyla , and has diagrammed their degree of interrelation ; ; but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than Salish
his privilege
, cloudy , possible has values of its own -- values of scope , stimulus , potential , and imagination
is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics : the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and elusive external links ; ; of classification first , with elapsed age merely a by-product ; ; of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in Athabascan , in Yokuts , in Uto-Aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them
step-by-step progress , and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry
the founders of glottochronology Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding , and Lees has repudiated his own share in the founding , that is no reason why we should swerve

no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast
time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble , solid , and limited basis
propose , first , an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved
propose , next , as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists , items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible
be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable
middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected
was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies
nevertheless almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a complete split over Germany , with hot heads on both sides planning to use the Germans against their former allies , and with Nazi-minded Germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other


Yalta Conference opened , the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down
great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine
delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage
was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line , which was substantially Russia's 1941 border , as the boundary between Russia and Poland
proposal was made , Stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference
up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject
memory of Russia's exclusion from the Paris Peace Conference and of the West's effort to stamp out Bolshevism at its birth boiled up within him
would drive us into shame '' , he declared
Russians and the Ukrainians would say that Stalin and Molotov were far less reliable defenders of Russia than Curzon and Clemenceau
long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland in some regions
not mind the Line itself , which Churchill declared in the House of Commons , on February 27 , 1945 , he had always believed to be `` just and right '' , but he did not want it called by a hated name
had long since forgotten the events of 1919 , but it was not so easy for the Red leaders , who felt that they had suffered great injustice in that period
Dunn-Atherton memorandum of February 4 , 1942 , the State Department had expected to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 boundaries
made it clear that he meant to move Poland's western borders deep into Germany , back to the western Neisse-Oder River lines , taking not only East Prussia and all of Silesia but Pomerania and the tip of Brandenburg , back to and including Stettin
to nine million additional Germans would be evicted , though most would have fled , and Poland would receive far more from Germany than the poor territories , including the great Pripet Marshes , which she lost to Russia
that he preferred to continue the war a little longer , `` although it costs us blood '' , in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense of the Germans
time Churchill was not so cordial toward moving Poland westward as he had been at Teheran , where he and Eden had both heartily approved the idea
a prolonged study of the Oder line on a map '' , at Teheran , Churchill `` liked the picture ''
tell the Poles , he said , that they had been `` given a fine place to live in , more than three hundred miles each way ''
he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave , trying to find work in Germany , and Roosevelt objected to the Western Neisse River being chosen in the south , instead of the Eastern Neisse , both of which flow into the Oder
was left in abeyance , presumably for the peace conference
there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong Poland , both industrially and agriculturally , and one unplagued by large minorities of Germans or Russians
of millions of the German master-race , from the very heart of Junkerdom , to make room for the Polish Slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate was a drastic operation , but there was little doubt that it was historically justified

importance to the West than Poland's boundaries was the character of her government
the West still believed that Eastern Europe could be kept in its orbit , in spite of the onrushing Soviet armies
democracy had ever been practised in this region , and much of it was still ruled by feudalistic means , it was taken for granted that at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this area and Western capitalism preserved within it
as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions , it was important to both Roosevelt and Churchill that the Poles should have them
was acute because the exiled Polish Government in London , supported in the main by Britain , was still competing with the new Lublin Government formed behind the Red Army
was spent in trying to marry these incompatibles than over any subject discussed at Yalta
was an agreement that the Lublin Government should be `` reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the Poles abroad '' , and pledged to hold `` free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot ''
democratic and anti-Nazi parties '' were to have the right to campaign
as moderator of the long debate on this issue
a matter of principle with Churchill , since Britain had declared war in behalf of Poland
it was a matter of life and death
this completely clear
`` great earnestness '' , he said : `` For the Russian people , the question of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security
, Poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into Russia
the last thirty years our enemies , the Germans , have passed through this corridor
in Russia's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful , in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force
necessary that Poland should be free , independent in power
it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the Soviet state ''
words , the Soviet Union was determined to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the Soviets or posing as an independent , balancing power in between Russia and Germany
that invariably thereafter the Soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in Poland
was also as inevitable as anything could be
elections that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government in which Moscow had complete confidence , and all pressure from the West for free voting by anti-Soviet elements in Poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements

In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern Europe , where the upper classes had generally collaborated with the Nazis , even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into Russia as a part of Hitler's armies
Yalta the conflicting expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe `` to create democratic institutions of their own choice ''
case `` here in their judgment conditions require '' ( italics added ) they would `` form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive to the will of the people ''
affirmations in the Declaration on Liberated Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the Western model
developed that the Soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy , which will be discussed later , and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should unite in establishing democratic conditions , as we understand them , within their zone of influence
thinks that at Yalta , Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him , that he thought the exclusion of the anti-Soviet voters from East European elections would not be greatly resented by his allies , while neither Roosevelt nor Churchill frankly faced `` the fact that , in Poland at least , genuinely free democratic elections would return governments unfriendly to Russia '' , by any definition of international friendliness
propaganda and cooperation had `` obscured the differences between Russian and Western ideas of democracy '' , and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil the military victories over Germany and Japan
of these formulae could not please both sides , for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable
to concede governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union instead of opposed to it , we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in East Europe
was described in a far-sighted editorial in The New York Herald Tribune , on March 5 , 1947 , in connection with the submission of the satellite peace treaties to the Senate
so Marshall and Byrnes were `` asking for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international life ''
entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world
were troubled about the fate of the Baltic States
us with comforting illusions of a Western capitalist-democratic political economy reigning supreme up to the Curzon line and the borders of Bessarabia '' ( Italics added )
a penetrating description of our post-war illusion , which applied to other areas than East Europe
editorial continued that `` We expected to democratize Japan and Korea and to see a new China pattern itself easily on our institutions
, in short , that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple , from such a position , to deal with the localized aberrations of the Soviet Union ''
`` the image corresponded in no way to the actualities of the post-war world
military , our economic nor our ideological power reached far enough '' to determine the fate of East Europe
editorial added prophetically : `` how far they may reach in Asia is yet undetermined , but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences ''
the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been written
heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite treaties , President Truman re-declared the Cold War on March 12 , 1947 , in the Truman Doctrine , exactly one week after the Herald Tribune editorial was written , and a year after the Cold War had been announced by Churchill at Fulton , Missouri , in Truman's presence
promptly went Communist , and Mr. Truman had to fight the interminable Korean war for the democratization of Korea before we learned how far our writ did `` reach in Asia ''
war , strain , and hatred ; ; of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the United States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World War 2 , -- Communist control of East Europe and China -- a new balance of power
Cold War raged it was easy to blame it all on Yalta
in summarizing a series of careful essays on the Yalta Conference , Forrest Pogue could find no basis for Yalta becoming `` a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents of Roosevelt and international cooperation ''
Yalta Papers were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal by anyone
of the election falls naturally in four parts
the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation , planning and discussion
slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes
interests supported electoral planning , although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination
major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting
skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach
the regionally differentiated results , which appear below in tables , are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances
aspect , and probably the one open to most controversy , is the results of the election
procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation , but all vitally interested parties , including the government itself , were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections
and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics
figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence
stressed in the speeches of Si Mubarak Bekkai when the first Council of Ministers was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council
5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on May Day , 1957
a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic
complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin until the fall of 1957 , this goal appears somewhat ambitious
very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in Moroccan politics , precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government
Charter of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 , there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes
was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I. ( Parti Democratique de l'Independance ) , the most important minor party at the time , objected to the Istiqlal's predominance in the civil service and influence in Radio Maroc
rumors that the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings
following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that `` the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists , lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself '' would be supported by the King himself
crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections , but French consultants were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time
, 1958 , the Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the King , the rumors of election dates appeared once again , first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer
government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958 , the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied
1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement Populaire ) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party
were on the whole unprepared for elections , while the people were still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after-effects of poor harvests in 1957
internal and international crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central issue
prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held
eagerly sought `` homogeneity '' of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy , labor politics and economic development
, 1958 , when ' Abdallah Ibrahim became President of the Council , elections had even greater importance
increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort
the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed
personnel and a special office was created in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections
time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete
only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions
rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results
new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance
absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent
respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power
power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process
to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco
central level the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form of the scrutin de liste system , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger and favored by all political parties
of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country , but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections
elections were for local officials , it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates
member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly
and the Ministry of the Interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and , thereby , give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance
national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation
setting of the Moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization
of effective power in Rabat leads not only to party bickering , but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections
can be found in the results of the Chamber of Commerce elections , which took place three weeks before national elections
U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union Marocaine Des Commercants , Industrialistes et Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union National Des Forces Populaires ) in nearly all urban centers
more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen , the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more progressive , labor-based U.N.F.P.
party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years
Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A. offices did not campaign and lost heavily
of the elections was lost , both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest , as shown in Table 1
of Commerce elections were , of course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections
learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. support , was most effective
found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics
effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place
major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections
somewhat technical subject , it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated
the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results
qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure
background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections
and later the Popular Movement protected the Istiqlal's `` privileged position '' until the fall of Balafrej , and then the Istiqlal used the same argument , which it had previously ignored , against the pro-U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government
of the preparation had , of course , proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior , whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics
some areas of recurring trouble , like Bani Mellal , where inexperienced officials had been appointed , there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process
however , the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage
decided to remove Ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party Council of Government under his personal direction
monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance , his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor
Council was itself inescapably of political meaning , which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U.N.F.P. members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders
details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections , and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U.N.F.P.
began in the fall of 1959 , although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958
three major administrative tasks : the fixing of electoral districts , the registration of voters and the registration of candidates
began in late November 1959 and continued until early January , 1960
was most anxious that there be a respectable response
of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials
was fixed , as given in Table 2 , and attention focused on its fulfillment
to vote were kept very simple
and women of twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification
liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking
were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens , criminals and those punished for Protectorate activities
figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census
workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future
training schools provide such training , but the current need exceeds the facilities
The present Federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $7 million to support , on a matching basis , state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture , trades , industrial skills and home economics
some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this Federal program
Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $29 million in addition to the $7 million under the Smith Act
Amendment Act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse training
major change in this program was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act
of $15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians
program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools
, administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts
states remain primarily in an assisting role , providing leadership and teacher training
is limited to half of the total expenditure , and the state or local districts must pay at least half
may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost , or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it
history of the program , state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures , while local districts all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments
Federal funds account for only one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education
impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds
considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal training expenditures in recent decades
War 2 , about 7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities : ( 1 ) Vocational Education for National Defense , and ( 2 ) War Production Training
cost of the five-year program was $297 million
Smith-Hughes , George-Barden , and National Defense Act of 1958 , the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years was only about $740 million
measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training
a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade schools and technical schools
, many large corporations operate their own formal training programs
study indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations
industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions
Manpower Council of Columbia University has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained
little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education
to hire youth with such training rather than those without , and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training
do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers , but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills
states , trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools , usually located in the larger cities
fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses
about 13 per cent of the schools have programs , and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent
recent trend is the development of area vocational schools
number of years Kentucky , Louisiana and several other states have been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties
are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts
be provided from nearby school districts
provided mainly for post high school day programs ; ; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend , and evening extension courses also may be conducted
8 , program of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools
there were such schools in all but 4 states
operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas
of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken
new industry Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry
training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a large number of semi-skilled machine operators
key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager , or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere
industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees
of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled
can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being
besides the training provided to youth in school , the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts
make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry
exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant
of programs The major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands
is not unique to labor surplus areas , for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country
vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers
manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs , of estimating the growth of local jobs , and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content
there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys
can be seen and counted , while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical
U. S. Department of Labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements , there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning
S. Office of Education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys
is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment
have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills
is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained
the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary
is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable
the available information comes not from the Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states
and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities
a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs
question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided
little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job
there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training
one major difficulty is the local focus
program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards , and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community
is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere , many more workers can be expected to respond
is who will pay for the training
districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training
are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it
development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it
have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools , but their focus is still on area job opportunities
Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs
state funds were used to pay for the vocational education , it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states
if Federal funds are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment
would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities
possibility is suggested by the example of the G. I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate
would require some support for subsistence as well as for tuition , but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a Youth Conservation Corps
of $600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home
of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor
being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas , the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training
training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located
heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative , on-the-job and extension training
assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual
and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training
, the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences
fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance
the application of the count rules to the width ( horizontally ) of the configuration gives us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline
idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement
is what really `` sold '' point and figure
is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense
show that only the vaguest generalities apply , and in fine , these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations and intensities of events
, too much does not happen too suddenly , nor does very little take long
and disadvantages of these two types of charting , bar charting and point and figure charting , remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among their respective professional advocates , with both methods enjoying in common , one irrevocable merit
both trend-following methods
we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum , the `` odds '' still favor them both , for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse
, many more things are charted besides prices
have been methods of charting prices , but now let us look at some of the other indices that are customarily charted , and which are looked to for their forecasting abilities
for methods The search for forecasting formulae is ceaseless
been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price
behind this is , of course , fundamentalist in character
number of reported freight car loadings increased , this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity , and consequently increased stock earnings , implying fatter dividends , and implying therefore increased stock market prices
know that things rarely ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion , and that car loadings , while perhaps interesting enough , are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn
quest for such an index goes on ceaselessly , with all manner of investors and speculators participating , ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the proverbial shoe-string operator , all seeking doggedly , studiously , daily -- and often nightly -- for the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal secret : Which way will the market move -- up or down
to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth , a quest heavily invested in , during the days of wooden ships
heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting index
offers careers
this goes on in offices high up in Wall Street's lofty wind-swept towers
men who make moving averages of weekly volume , monthly averages of price-earnings ratios , ratios of the number of advances to the number of declines , ratios of an individual stock's performance to overall market performance , ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume , odd-lot indices , and what not
concerned with all things traded in , securities , bonds , cocao , coffee , soybeans , cotton , tin , oats , etc.
Chicago's West Jackson Boulevard , La Salle Street , and around the Merchandise Mart Plaza there sit men who chart crop reports , who divide the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs , and the number of hogs by the amount of corn
the open interest curves , rainfall curves , and they even divide Democratic congressmen by Republican congressmen
things and countless more enter into their calculations , and yet , the enchanting index remains non-forthcoming
at any rate , in the fuller sense of the word
are far too subtle , and the last word in these endeavors will doubtless never be written , for the enchanting index is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth
civilized men no longer pursue the fountain , they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting index
odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago
stock market , the normal trading package is a hundred shares , just as 5,000 bushels is the standard grain contract package
transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange
in a separate record being made , distinguishing these trades from the overall volume of trading
the theory underlying odd-lot indices , the trader who trades odd lots is most likely a small trader , one who can't afford to trade round lots
to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast , they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders
easily prey to an adverse market movement , for this rank of traders can least afford to lose , virtually anything the odd-lot traders do , marketwise , is taken to exemplify the `` wrong '' thing to do
the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers
observers then make graphs of the data according to their particular statistical recipe
, for example , plot it exactly as is , or they might make ten day moving averages of it , or longer moving averages , or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales
recipe is a matter of individual taste
is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart , usually of a popular stock average
end of an intermediate or major rise , while the top is forming on the price chart , it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply
the chartist that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top
at the opposite end of the market cycle , towards the end of an intermediate or major decline , usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart , it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood
in the aggregate , the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the bottoms , notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions
had long been known in general , that `` the public is always wrong '' , the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical basis
well wonder why the `` public is always wrong '' and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg
first
really that the `` public '' buys at the tops , and not that the market tops out when the `` public '' buys
converse at bottoms
`` public '' usually sell at bottoms , or does the market usually bottom out when the `` public '' sells
been using the word `` public '' in quotation marks , that is , in its vernacular connotation with reference to the odd-lot index theory
has to sell in order for someone to buy , and vice versa
all concerned are members of the literal public , somewhat less than all concerned , although still a majority , form the quotation marked `` public ''
public minus the `` public '' leaves the so-called `` sophisticated '' element -- the element on the other end of the `` public's '' transactions
is often called `` strong hands ''
differ from `` weak hands '' in that their operations are the primary movers
campaigns , so to speak , even if this initiation is diffused among them , and their concerted action only psychologically organized
act ; ; weak hands react
move first ; ; weak hands ask , What is going on
hands buy , they are able to buy more , and they do it even in the face of bearish news reports
able to sit more patiently with what they have bought
say , strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands , for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up , at higher prices , during the run-up phase of the campaign
disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair , dirty , or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces
all , can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these things were true
imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose , and the majority would make consistent profits
and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few
the taunt concerning the `` sophisticated '' echelon and its alleged erudition is put to test during every campaign , and accrues only upon results ; ; not before
often happens that campaigns go askew , resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands into played-out hands , just as a member of a former campaign's `` public '' may emerge flatteringly `` right '' the next time
the echelons fluctuates too
of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow , what with all observers trying to get on the side of the `` few '' at the same time
of this study and of configuration analysis as well , declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use
to , by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word `` few ''
must persist as to the future course of prices , if there is to persist a market at all
few must win what the many lose , for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all , and is , in fact , unimaginable
be no squeamishness about admitting this
doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority loses
Magee , whose work has been discussed in this chapter , was quoted in a New Yorker Magazine profile as saying : `` Of course , you have to remember it's a good thing for us chartists that there aren't more of us
got too many people investing by this method , their operations would begin to affect stock prices , and thus throw the charts off
would become self-defeating ''
H. Wheelan's Study Helps In Point And Figure Technique tells the readers : `` We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities markets ''
traders trading for so many different objectives , and what with there being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading techniques in use , and more coming into use all the time , it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` fans '' to invalidate itself
all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible modes of expression , if they lead to a market committment at all
final analysis , then , the user becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance , notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation , however elaborate
his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed , it is commonplace for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed
methods of deciding may be profound and diverse , the possible conclusions remain but two
, more methods the hoaxes The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use , so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow , and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead
the outlook for interest rates in 1961 , the question , as always , is the prospect for general business activity
large , what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates
the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal , monetary , and other Federal policies which affect interest rates
been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity
of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau , but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy
for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident
pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest , it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer
difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust
of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some decline
business cycles , when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain
time , however , there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction
are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments ( 7.6% in September )
other hand , in a more favorable vein , general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising Federal spending , and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course
increase in retail sales in October to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference Board , which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans
of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way
will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit , as well as by an expansion of Government spending , well sustained consumer spending , and some rebuilding of business inventories
pressure What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961
that during the next several months , through the spring of 1961 , the demand for long-term capital funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower , especially the rates on Federal , state , and local bonds , as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds
as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present , as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters , the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high , so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great
likely , moreover , that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions , interest rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year , although the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate , e.g. , easier downpayment and amortization terms
trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here , we are likely to see additional steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit
further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility , as well as an easier reserve position for the banking system
the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow of gold , as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy , which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle
policy One of the most intriguing questions is whether the recent departures of the Federal Reserve authorities from confining their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread into longer-term Government securities in the next few months
extent that the new Administration has its wishes , the Federal Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of Government securities and aggressively seek to force down long-term interest rates
of `` bills only '' , or `` bills preferably '' , seems so strongly accepted by the Federal Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities
to the extent that the monetary authorities , in their effort to ease credit in the next several months , conduct their open market operations in longer-term Government bonds , they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces
end of the spring of 1961 , assuming that a general business recovery gets under way , interest rates should begin to edge upward again , depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to restrain credit availability
would be that interest rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the downturn
pertinent to ask the question : Has the long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course , and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates
is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels
forces This view is based upon several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in the Sixties , as follows : ( 1 ) Recent events in the General Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us , and probably intensify , for the foreseeable future
it certain that Federal expenditures for military preparedness and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years
just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new African nations against the ruthless competition of the Communist bloc
to overcome the lead of the Russians in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending
it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country , to keep ahead of the Communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs , will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas such as education , housing , medical aid , and the like
serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures , of which I take a dim view , but it seems very likely to occur
) During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping up in the rate of household formations , which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building
the latest projections of the Bureau of the Census , the annual rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years
most favorable assumptions for increase , the Bureau of the Census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise from about 883,000 in the last two years of the Fifties to an annual rate of about 1,018,000 in the first five years of the Sixties , and to a slightly higher annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the decade
Seventies the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of 1,338,000 in the second half of that decade
the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospects of the Sixties
the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated
annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1,525,000 in the three-year period from April 1947 to March 1950
) With the expansion of family formation in the Sixties , a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated
an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand
local expenditures ( in real terms ) increased persistently from $26.5-billion in 1949 to $44.3-billion in 1959 , and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade , which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion by 1970
be a powerful force for raising business activity
) It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play , the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties
keen competition in our industrial system , and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research , plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade
) In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook , I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was dammed-up during the Thirties and World War 2 , is finally in the process of running dry
some clear-cut evidence of this
, the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the VA home loan guaranty program seems to have largely exhausted itself
the failure of home-building as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing , and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings , may also signal in part that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an end
way , we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted in the Fifties
backlog of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the War was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the War , and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields
public has used up a good part of these liquid assets , or they have been drained by the rising price level , and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier
not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties
confident that it will , but consumer spending in the Sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the Fifties
become more competitive as consumers become more selective
requirements Accordingly , during the Sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the Fifties and , in the process , to require enormous amounts of capital funds
of industry are the result of a complex of forces -- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases
of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature , but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries
may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable , the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World War 2
the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented
of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition , but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny
industry's product price has been kept below the `` profit-maximizing '' and `` entry-limiting '' prices due to fears of public reaction , the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands
of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition , and an exploration of some of its implications
to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force , which we may call the effect of `` public-limit pricing '' on `` key '' wage bargains , we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces , such as union power , which may be relevant in an actual situation
purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages
, below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions
, discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions
, discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions
, is a brief summary
Appendix presents the rigorous argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit
the assumptions of the model A
The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product
is lacking
purposes of setting the product price , the industry behaves as a single entity
negotiations , the industry bargains as a unit with a single union

for the industry's product We are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry's product
in which this is shared among firms is taken as given
given time period , the aggregate demand for the industry's product is determined by two things : the price charged by the industry , and the level of Aj
purposes of this discussion , the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables , since GNP includes other prices
abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately
form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price , and vary directly with the level of Aj

price policy The industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest
its importance , and because the lack of price competition is well recognized , the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases
of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases
industry of this model , the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing price ( given the wage rate and the level of GNP ) , and even below the entry-limited price ( but not below average cost )
an industry , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs ( due to rising wages , etc. )
if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge , this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate
model , we abstract from all non-wage sources of cost changes , so that the `` public-limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises
circumstances , it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate
costs rise when the wage rate rises , the profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter
price will also be raised for potential domestic competition , but unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy , we might expect the public-limit price to approach the entry-limit price
price would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign costs directly
approach becomes critical , the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in `` resisting '' the wage pressures of a powerful union , requesting tariff relief after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union pressure
not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase
to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things : the passage of time , the level of GNP , and the size of the wage increase
abstracting from the fact of strikes here , but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry
may deliberately take a strike , not to put pressure on the union , but in order to `` educate '' the government and the customers of the industry
strike continues , these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement
increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail
and resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases are on the order of 3% per month
passage of an additional eleven months' time makes the second 3% boost more acceptable
the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase
however , that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per se , without an accompanying wage increase
higher levels of GNP do not , in themselves , provide grounds for raising prices , but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase
not extended to anticipated levels of GNP , however -- only the current level of GNP affects the public pressure against wage-price increases
since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases ( e.g. , if a wage increase of 5% allows a price increase of 7% , a wage increase of 10% allows a price increase of something less than 14% )

We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced ( the average cost curve is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve ) , and is the same for every firm ( and therefore for the industry )
of this average cost is determined by factor prices , technology , and so forth
have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate
of average cost ( equal to marginal cost ) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate

and collective bargaining issues The single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership , and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate
does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy -- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment
vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases , and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases , but we abstract from these forces here
present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs
something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry , much less to the union or to the public
the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared
of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage rate
further that the union recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate
political reasons , the union asks for ( and accepts ) increases in the basic wage rate , and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate , but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry
the basic wage rate are cost-raising , and they constitute an argument for raising prices
it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate , although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude
model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise
for non-negative changes in the basic wage rate , the industry becomes the active wage-setter , since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence
in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case , on the grounds that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously
presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model
this conclusion that we challenge ; ; we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based
the operation of the model It is convenient to assume that the union-industry contract is of one year's duration
century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law
contributed to this change
of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow
1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe , but for the world
Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century
had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense
imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared
respects , international law was Europeanized
not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions
one hand , the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty , independence , formal equality -- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the `` flexibility of alignment '' that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous Napoleonic experience
was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world
theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere
in Africa and Asia and even in Latin America ( though limited in Latin America by the special interest of the United States as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine , itself from the outset related to European politics and long dependent upon the `` balance of power '' system in Europe ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the European `` balance '' itself
such as Switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality ; ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist from the North ) was the neutralization of the Latin American countries ; ; out of the question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa
of the law was made explicit by a number of 19th century scholars
was put upon the fact that international law was the law of `` civilized nations '' ; ; Kent and Story , the great early American scholars , repeatedly made use of this phrase , or of `` Christian nations '' , which is a substantial equivalent
that the public law was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European origin ''
it had always been of European origin in fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory
with virtually every writer , not only was the European origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon , but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed on others
customs on which international law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states
for example , was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside European civilization must formally enter into the circle of law-governed countries
do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction ''
nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today
of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international law ; ; that is , from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states
is important , for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among sovereigns , this was by no means its exclusive domain
of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens , to foreigners , and to each other in a conceptually unified system
of international law , which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America , broke this unity and this universality
sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations
did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do ; ; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action
this development , we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy
and most obvious , was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state , and the individual's identification with the state , as transcending other ties of social solidarity
was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred
its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of `` state will '' put forward by the Germans , especially by Hegel , although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes
was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection
international community this reduced law to Jellinek's auto-limitation
, the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent
the new theories , the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors
longer sought to find the law ; ; he made it ; ; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be
no law , domestic or international , except that willed by , acknowledged by , or consented to by states
Hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence
, but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another
in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions
of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions , particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization , led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions
a conscious process , something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms
this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed
way of doing things , which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations , was no longer adequate to the task
the period of codification of existing law : the Code Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification that , in fact , resulted from Austin's restatement and ordering of the Common Law in England
followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation , some changing and adjusting the older law , much dealing with entirely new situations
mills have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes were no longer adequate to the task , a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another , to the executive
eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law
with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific
systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament -- the elected representatives -- at the expense of the more conservative judiciary
power of the latter was made both limited and explicit -- when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands -- two purposes were served : Government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will , and law became a rational system for implementing that will , for serving conscious goals , for embodying the `` public policy ''
true that , initially , the task was to remove restrictions that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow of money , goods , and labor ; ; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy
seen as an emanation of the `` sovereign will ''
the sovereign was not Hobbes' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of Austin
, too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by no means an immoral or amoral one
through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom , was master of his destiny
did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique
merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government
not opposed to either justice or morality ; ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority
this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society
the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie , and this objective required that governmental authority -- administrative officials and judges -- be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; ; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated ; ; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market ; ; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with
conceived as the free bargain of formal equals -- replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status-conscious society
contract was the dominant legal theme of the century , the touchstone of the free society
was based upon contract ; ; business organization -- the corporation -- was analyzed in contractual terms ; ; trade was based on freedom of contract , and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms ; ; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement
not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract
, some -- Anzilotti is the principle example -- went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal norm , Pacta sunt Servanda
( at least to a considerable extent ) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law theory and doctrine
first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law , rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system
was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations
, the law merchant , and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older Law of Nations and made dependent on the several national laws
law ( which Americans call the `` conflict of laws '' ) was thus segregated from international law proper , or , as it is often called , public international law
free to enact , within broad , though ( perhaps ) determinate limits , their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts , to vary the law merchant , and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas
was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation , and then largely in marginal situations
Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 1 , power
view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1
seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction
jurisdiction For almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts ( subject to review by the Supreme Court ) for the protection of most rights arising under national law
1875 , apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the Civil War , Congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority -- concurrently with state tribunals -- to decide cases involving federal-right questions
of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference
arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process
, presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves , became a `` laissez-faire '' limitation upon state economic policy
of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government
with a series of measures modifying in various ways what it had granted in 1875
it required the convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the Supreme Court
was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter
an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction proceedings upon institution of state court test cases
ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate orders
later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions against collection of state taxes
for state adjudication , in the first instance , the two major areas where federal injunctions had been most obnoxious , but other areas remained vulnerable
the Supreme Court , like Congress , showed misgivings concerning this aspect of government by injunction
the traditional discretion of the chancellor , Mr. Justice Holmes introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention
earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state remedies , the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue
case is Railroad Commission v. Pullman
had issued an administrative order which was challenged as discriminatory against Negroes
was enjoined by a federal trial court
the Supreme Court , via Mr. Justice Frankfurter , found southern racial problems `` a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to adjudication is open ''
was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether the offending order had in fact been authorized
as usual , to interpret state legislation -- such interpretation can only be a `` forecast rather than a determination '' -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter led a unanimous Court to vacate the injunction
is crucial that here , unlike Burford , the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question
resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication ''
, i.e. , postponement , is one thing ; ; refusal to adjudicate is another
extent that the jurisdictional principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation , federal equitable relief against state action must be available -- or so it seems to Mr. Justice Frankfurter
Public Service Commission v. Southern Ry. Co. , the commission had refused to permit abandonment of certain `` uneconomic '' train facilities
, claiming deprivation of property without due process of law , sought injunctive relief
held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be obstructed ; ; this in the name of equitable discretion
and Jackson concurred in the Court's result , for they found no merit in the railroad's claim
objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of Congress : `` By one fell swoop the Court now finds that Congress indulged in needless legislation in the acts of 1910 , 1913 , 1925 , 1934 and 1937
measures , Congress , so the Court ( in effect ) now decides , gave not only needless but inadequate relief , since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the Act of 1875 against all proceedings challenging local regulation ''
revealing recent case is Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills
Act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over `` suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce ''
face this merely provides a federal forum ; ; it does not establish any law ( rights ) for the federal judges to enforce
judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when Congress has created none
held that Congress had intended the federal judiciary to `` fashion '' an appropriate law of labor-management contracts
, congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not create , or specify , the right to be enforced
Mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal `` common law '' which , as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in dissent , leads to one of the following `` incongruities '' : `` ( ( 1 ) conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements ; ; ( 2 ) displacement of state law by federal law in state courts in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements ; ; or ( 3 ) exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters ''
elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that Congress' purpose was merely to make unions suable
few exceptions , the lawmakers seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved -- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges
these constitutional difficulties , Mr. Justice Frankfurter was prepared to read the Taft-Hartley provision as concerned with diversity , rather than federal question , jurisdiction
satisfy what presumably was Congress' major purpose -- the suability of unions
also leave intact the states' traditional authority in the realm of contract law
we have seen , the Erie and York decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state decisional rules
again Mr. Justice Frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation
wants to displace the states from areas which they have customarily occupied , let it do so knowingly and explicitly
it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judges
Mills suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases , the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages
a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases
not clearly defined the bounds between state and federal court competence
the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a case-by-case basis
student has suggested that `` In any new revision ( of the Judicial Code ) the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law might be used , leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation of pronouncing state law ''
the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinions -- to the extent that Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion
rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in the FELA certiorari cases , in the administrative law area , and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review
Black no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and `` just '' result
not be `` fooled by technicalities ''
of state decisions With few exceptions , Congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising under federal law
it differently , state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right
uniformity in the meaning of national law , however , state interpretations are subject to Supreme Court review
be noted , parenthetically , that to evade `` desegregation '' an ex-Justice and former southern governor has urged Congress to abolish this reviewing authority
, of course , would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states
also probably mean different things within the same state -- depending upon what court ( state or federal ) rendered decision
here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial federal-state relationship
is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance
certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials , each level of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures
choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure
canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals , e.g. , in diversity cases
FELA controversy the state court followed established state procedure by construing a vague complaint `` most strongly against '' the complainant
words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the pleader by state law
was that the plaintiff's case was dismissed
Black led a reversing majority : `` Strict local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law ''
as in the Byrd case , another element of state procedure was subsumed to federal judge-made law
and Jackson dissented : `` One State may cherish formalities more than another , one State may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms
litigant chooses to enforce a Federal right in a State court , he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated -- the particularity , for instance , with which a cause of action must be described
, though invoked in a State court , delimits the Federal claim -- defines what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it
form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it , so long as a requirement does not add to , or diminish , the right as defined by Federal law , nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities of litigation ''
in the area of federal-state relationships is this : what constitutes reversible error in a state decision
Chicago involved a conviction for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance
in question was a speech
did not object to the trial court's charge to the jury that discourse `` may constitute a breach of the peace if it stirs the public to anger , invites dispute , brings about a condition of unrest
present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal Constitution
accused raised many other objections , he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings
, he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right
can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381(c)(9) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization ( section 381(c)(16) ) , but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it ; ; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation ( section 381(c)(6) ) , but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization ; ; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company ( section 381(c)(14) ) , but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes
, and most of the others listed above , seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381
not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities
to items such as these the provisions of section 381(c) , viewed in historical perspective , suggest a rule requiring survival , whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation
extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified , since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication , if not the language , of the statute
not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes
interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ; it would certainly violate the intention of Congress as expressed in the Committee Report ; ; and in at least one instance , involving refund claims , it might be contrary to another provision of the United States Code
Section 203 of the United States Code voids an assignment of a claim against the Government unless made after it has been allowed , the amount due has been ascertained , and a warrant for its payment has been issued
were not for judicial development of certain exceptions , this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation , even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section 381(a)
recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation
case , Seaboard Air Line Railway v. United States , held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor , and it has been consistently followed
said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a stranger to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly tenuous claims , against the Government
, said the Court , applied to the case at hand ; ; furthermore , Congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states
are assignments for the benefit of creditors , corporate dissolutions , transfers by descent , or transfers by subrogation
often classified as transfers by `` operation of law ''
reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an `` operation of law '' mold
is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash , to which section 203 quite clearly applies , the courts and Treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund of taxes paid by transferors
case in point is Mitchell Canneries v. United States , in which a claim against the Government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership , whose partners were former stockholders , and then to another corporation formed by the partners
final corporation entitled to sue on the claim , the Court cited the Seaboard , Novo Trading , and Roomberg cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the statute ''
earlier case , Kingan & Co. v. United States , an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the British corporation
statute was held not to prevent the American corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the British corporation
presumably would have qualified under section 368(a)(1) as a contractual reorganization , followed by a section 332 liquidation , but not under section 368(a)(1) as a statutory merger of consolidation
, nevertheless , relied on the Seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders of the two corporations were the same
, said the Court , there was no transfer of equitable title
arrives at substantially the same conclusion , but skirts the problem of section 203 of the United States Code
54-17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation , a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax , followed by the name of the successor corporation
of the liquidation and succession must also be filed
succession is a matter of public record , certificates of the Secretaries of State or other public officials having custody of the documents will suffice ; ; if the succession is not of record , all documents relating to such succession , properly certified , are required
proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation , the latter to a contractual acquisition
would not , however , apply to an acquisition of assets for cash
Ruling , although rather confusing , cites and follows Rev. Rul. 54-17
suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization
a successor corporation in a C reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the merged corporation despite section 203
B reorganization , followed by a section 332 liquidation , those cases which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor
, a cash purchase of a corporation's stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the Kimbell-Diamond doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step
appear sound
in Seaboard and numerous other cases , the two primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the United States Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims on a contingent-fee basis
have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed
reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section 381(a) , which is the only type presently under discussion
applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent , a statutory merger or consolidation , an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets solely in exchange for voting stock , or a change of identity , form , or place of organization
every case the transferor corporation is liquidated , and its former stockholders either own outright , or have a continuing stock interest in , the assets which gave rise to the tax
circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote
in a C reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger , to which the statute is clearly inapplicable
it at all likely that a `` desperate '' claim against the Government will be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization
transferor has substantial assets other than the claim , it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes
an unlikely transaction were to take place , it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase , followed by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary , followed by liquidation
rare case where a corporation's only substantial asset , or its most important one , is a claim for refund , perhaps its transfer should not be permitted , whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock
, then , that although the matter is not dealt with in section 381(c) , a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section 381(a) is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation
of the United States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the Government transferred in tax-free reorganizations
corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims
attributes of the transferor There are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved
, property `` used in the trade or business '' of a transferor corporation , as defined in section 1231 , presumably would not retain its special status following a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation
of a group filing consolidated returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section 368(a)(1) , but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not , for example , elected to file consolidated returns with its own subsidiaries
presumably made it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting ( section 381(c)(4) ) or depreciation ( section 381(c)(6) )
of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provide for survival of certain of a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization
requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis for property transferred , and section 1223 provides for tacking on the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee
permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period
a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for a person acquiring emergency facilities
to a loss carryover
be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items
, suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted , providing for carryover of excess profits credits
right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover
an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income ; ; it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax
1939 Code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the Stanton Brewery case , but only over the dissent of Judge Learned Hand , who wrote the majority opinion in the Sansome case , a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization
type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954 , one cannot say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have
to this type of item , one might properly apply the language of the Committee Report , quoted above , which cautions against using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein
there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover
primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax avoidance

selecting mail questionnaire method There were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available : ( 1 ) interviews in depth with a few selected companies , and ( 2 ) the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire
method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions , it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies
result , it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government
also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature
recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations
the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents
yes '' or `` no '' answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have
may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question
also the problem of the respondent's frame of reference
respondent making a recommendation for his own benefit , for the benefit of his industry , for the benefit of a specific government department or service , for the benefit of the defense program , for the benefit of small business , or for the benefit of the taxpayers
also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on factual information and carefully considered judgment , or whether his answers were casual guesses
there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held -- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the alternatives
team was very mindful of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire
circumstances , however , the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point
preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered , and the structure and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations

the questionnaire The questionnaire was designed to elicit three types of information : ( 1 ) the facts regarding certain characteristics of the respondents , including their experience with , and interest in , securing defense business ; ; ( 2 ) the actual selling and buying practices of the respondents ; ; and ( 3 ) the attitudes and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and the methods of awarding defense contracts
hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did
sections of the questionnaire ( see Appendix B ) are devoted to the following : 1
classifying respondents ( Part A of the questionnaire ) 2
defense sales activities ( Part B of the questionnaire ) 3
in participating in advertised bidding for defense business ( Part C of the questionnaire ) 4
in participating in negotiated bidding for defense purposes ( Part D of the questionnaire ) 5
regarding advertised bidding ( Part E of the questionnaire ) 6
regarding negotiated bidding ( Part F of the questionnaire ) 7
regarding the methods of awarding defense contracts ( Part G of the questionnaire ) The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was optional
also stated that , in any event , all replies would be treated confidentially
interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves

pretest of the questionnaire The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months
, 1960 , an early draft of the questionnaire , along with a cover letter , was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of Washington
after the companies had received the questionnaire , members of the research team contacted the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have experienced in completing the questionnaire
resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire
team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might not be typical of those throughout the country , or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made
another test of the questionaire was made
draft was mailed in July , 1960 , to 100 firms throughout the United States
the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3,500 names submitted by member companies of the Aerospace Industries Association ( AIA list ) and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of 1,500 names compiled by the research team from the Thomas Register ( TR list )
of compiling the AIA and TR lists will be described later
after the questionnaires were mailed , follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once
in all were received
were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent
letter , questionnaire , and follow-up postcard were then revised into final form ( see Appendixes A , B , and C )

mailing lists The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs
to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind
of companies were made and used in the study
was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of Washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work
consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers
list was derived from a group of approximately 8,000 names supplied to the research team by the Aerospace Industries Association
were secured from member companies by the Association from the forty-four sources listed in Appendix Aj
selected from its approved bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems
, the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address
lists supplied by the AIA member companies were merged and duplicate names were eliminated
further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive
names were then checked against the Thomas Register list ( see below ) and duplicate names were removed from the AIA lists
steps the final AIA list was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500
list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the Thomas Register
compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the Aerospace Industries Association were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs
difference might have resulted from : 1
that the Aerospace Industries Association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs

that companies on the AIA lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection
as `` in-group '' , they might have different opinions and practices than an `` out-group '' composed of those companies not so participating but interested in defense business

that AIA lists might not have been selected on a random basis
sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical listing of manufacturers in the Thomas Register
bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified , the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted
names were selected in this fashion

questionnaire Each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm
were mailed in Seattle , Washington , and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of Idaho , Montana , Oregon , and Washington
used for the addresses outside the Pacific Northwest
contained a postage-prepaid return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the Pacific Northwest , and by airmail for those outside the Pacific Northwest
days after the questionnaire was mailed , a follow-up airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names
test mailing ( to 14 companies ) was made in June , 1960
test mailing ( to 100 companies ) was made in July , 1960
mailing of the questionnaire was made late in August , 1960 , to 4,900 firms consisting of 3,450 from the AIA list and 1,450 from the TR list

Over 1,000 returns were received within two weeks after the final mailing was made
to arrive until the end of December , 1960 , by which time a total of 1,343 returns were received representing 26.8 per cent of the 5,014 questionnaires sent out
could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed
1,286 returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 2

returns Each questionnaire was audited for obvious mistakes and for comments , and was identified by a serial number , by the source list from which the company name was selected , and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark on the return envelope
, except comments , were numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment
were key-punched into IBM punch cards and verified
required three cards and involved key punching 228 digital columns
to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate serial number of the respondent
were then processed using standard IBM punch card equipment , including an IBM 650 computer
step in processing was to analyze the returns from Questions 1 , 2 , and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses , in accordance with the definitions contained in ASPR Section 1-701
Chapter 2
results are shown in Table 3
from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms
step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the AIA list with those from companies on the TR list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study
and results of this comparative analysis are described in Appendix Aj
concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in , or wishing to sell to , defense programs
first place , the two groups of firms , when combined , had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the AIA list alone
Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world
summer of 1960 , it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle
in this economic struggle are the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee ( AWOC ) of the AFL-CIO and the agricultural employers of the State
of the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the farm placement program , we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces
not a pleasant or easy position , but one we have endeavored to maintain
sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties , but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose
one side was pleased and the other displeased , regardless of how we ruled
displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other
consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding
disconcerting , nevertheless , to read in a labor weekly , `` Perluss knuckles down to growers '' , and then to be confronted with a growers' publication which states , `` Perluss recognizes obviously phony and trumped-up strikes as bona fide ''
number of years , there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers
met with little sucess for a variety of reasons
inadequately financed , without experienced leadership , and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole
year the pattern has been different : The organizing program had the full support of the AFL-CIO , which supplied staff and money to the AWOC , as well as moral support
experienced and skillful , and financial resources were significant
where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties , failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life
result of these changed conditions , the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations has been much greater than in the past
has been able to employ the traditional weapons of labor -- the strike and the picket line -- with considerable success , particularly in the area of wages
very nature of the situation , it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management
, at least , the strategy of the AWOC has been selective ; ; that is to say , to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time , rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the State
we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program
because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance , we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the Unemployment Insurance Code , although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility
current issues arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists , and out of Public Law 78 and the Migrant Labor Agreement if Mexican nationals were employed at the ranch
us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser Act in its historical sense , as a major milestone in the development of public placement services
we think of it as a living , continuing , operating control over the system
when labor disputes arise , its provisions come clearly into play
accepted the provisions of that Act ( as have all other States ) by enacting into our Code ( Section 2051 ) a provision that The State of California accepts the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act , and will observe and comply with the requirements of that act
to labor disputes , the Wagner-Peyser Act states only , In carrying out the provisions of this Act , the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they are referred to employment
of the Act empower the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions , and he has done so
regulation for our purposes is Section 602.2 ( , ) , as follows : Referrals in labor dispute situations
shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which ( 1 ) is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute , or ( 2 ) the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute
to positions not covered by subparagraph ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this paragraph , any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists , provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral
this regulation , let us take the last sentence first
referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute , provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute
for example , a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields
shed workers go on strike
no dispute involving fieldwork
that we may refer workers to the fieldwork ( but not the packing shed work ) provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute
, no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision
the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue
it prohibits referrals under either condition ( 1 ) or condition ( 2 )
have contended that the Secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition , on the grounds that the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists
The matter got into the courts this way : One of the early strikes called by the AWOC was at the DiGiorgio pear orchards in Yuba County
that a labor dispute existed , and that the workers had left their jobs , which were then vacant because of the dispute
under clause ( 1 ) of the Secretary's Regulation , we suspended referrals to the employer
, no Mexican nationals were involved
employer , seeking to continue his harvest , challenged our right to cease referrals to him , and sought relief in the Superior Court of Yuba County
issued a temporary restraining order , directing us to resume referrals
of course , obeyed the court order
the Attorney General of California , at the request of the Secretary of Labor , sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the Federal District Court , on grounds that it was predominantly a Federal issue since the validity of the Secretary's Regulation was being challenged
the Federal Court held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act into its own Code , and presumably therefore also the regulations , it was now a State matter
refused to assume jurisdiction , whereupon the California Superior Court made the restraining order permanent
order , we have continued referring workers to the ranch
case arose at the Bowers ranch in Butte County , and the Superior Court of that county issued similar restraining orders
have strenuously argued that I should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the Secretary's Regulation
accept that view , either as a lawyer or as an administrator
First , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved
an accepted juridical principle in California that a Superior Court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent
conclusive , unless appealed , only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard
not binding upon another Superior Court , which could rule to the contrary
a decision is rendered by the District Court of Appeal ( or , of course , the Supreme Court ) is a binding precedent established
event , we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter , and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other Superior Courts
and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision , I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior Courts which in effect nullify the Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal law
I am in good company in this view
General of California concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the District Court of Appeal
General of the United States , in considering the power of the Secretary to issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers , has rendered an opinion sustaining his authority
and as an evidence of legislative intent only , the Senate of the United States recently defeated by a substantial majority the `` Holland Amendment '' to the Fair Labor Standards Act , which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the Secretary in these matters
let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals
far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in midair
of the issue are enormous
to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations , and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers
interest is so dominant in such an issue that I cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior Courts in the State
an issue which may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial finality is achieved
administrator , I cannot place the Employment Service in California in jeopardy of being out of compliance with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me
applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in Superior Court , in my opinion , would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor , were he so inclined , to notify the Governor of such noncompliance , set a date for hearing , and issue his finding
of noncompliance under the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear : the withdrawal of some $11 million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or , as a corollary , the taking over by the Federal Government of its operation
, the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike -- condition ( 1 ) in the Regulation of the Secretary
yet arisen under condition ( 2 ) , relating to referral to jobs `` the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute ''
problem is essentially one of defining the word `` filling ''
be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job specifications , union membership , union jurisdiction , and the like
it have a broader connotation of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of `` filling '' the job
the uncertainty of this definition , I solicited the interpretation of the Secretary of Labor
advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper one ; ; that is , that if wages , for example , is the only issue in a labor dispute , and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute , we may continue to make referrals

Stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them
have developed concepts , they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects ; ; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely
to think seems to increase consistently with age
showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years

indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science ; ; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events ; ; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden
How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics
amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects
is the result of many factors , the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life
the teacher who understands the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence , security , and satisfaction
responsibility of the teacher , suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 11
generalizations about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school children may be helpful

the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time , as contrasted to those of an adult

child grows older , his emotional reactions lead to `` moods '' , or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly , rather than in short , abrupt outbursts

the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects , noises , falling , and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years , but that fears of the dark , of being alone , and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase

child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem ; ; more effective solutions include explanations , the example of another child , or conditioning by associating the feared object , place , or person with something pleasant

help in learning to control their emotions
child learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums , screaming , kicking , and hitting will not get him what he wants ; ; the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers , and , therefore , makes a real effort to control his emotions

widely in their emotional responses
the patterns of emotional responses are similar ; ; as the influence of learning and environment are felt , emotional behavior becomes individualized
Although no national norms exist for the social development of children , the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels
summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children ; ; the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals , struggling to meet their developmental needs , and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which they hold membership

childhood , children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children ; ; after they have been in school a few years , their interest in playmates of their own age increases , and their interest in adults decreases ; ; the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family gatherings now considers it a bore
childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase ; ; the group sets the styles in clothing , the kind of play engaged in , and the ideals of right and wrong behavior

childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older , who can do the things he likes to do ; ; such factors as sex , intelligence , and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time

childhood , an interest in team games replaces individual play ; ; loyalty to the group , a feeling of superiority over those who are not members , and unwillingness to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits

childhood boys tease and bully , on the average , more than girls ; ; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do well-adjusted children

childhood boys like to tease , jostle , and talk smart to girls ; ; girls , who are more mature than boys , frown upon the youthful antics of boys of their own age

time pupils reach the sixth grade , their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed ; ; they exhibit a keen interest in social , political , and economic problems , but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work

ages of two and four years , negativism or resistance to adult authority is noticeable ; ; after the fourth year it begins to decline
as we have seen , in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers

child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups
in the primary grades can play harmoniously with one companion , but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger ; ; he wants to be with people , but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate
middle grades , however , he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader , helping to make plans and carry on group activities , and setting up rules governing the enterprise
teacher should study the individual pupil Much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children , yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program
failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit ; ; others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom
have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand
systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists
perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention , by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom , and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children
the classroom teacher , however , who has daily contacts with pupils , and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice
a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher , rather than merely an additional chore
administrators in many elementary schools have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals
should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success , and that they still must be treated as individuals
teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards , he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability , background , and experience
inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally , and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects
, which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six , found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity
apparent , therefore , that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children
child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning , insecurity , unhappiness , and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow
in turn inhibit learning , and a vicious cycle is completed
easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy , or that the child who lacks interest in school , who dislikes the teacher , or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent
of retardation and maladjustment may be found in physical factors , such as defective speech or hearing , impaired vision , faulty motor coordination , a frail constitution , chronic disease , malnutrition , and glandular malfunctioning
be caused by poor health habits , such as faulty eating and sleeping habits
be related to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work
may be too difficult for some and too easy for others
, learning materials , and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children
relations , broken homes , and undesirable community influences may also be contributing factors
only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children
these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner
handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading disability for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading
home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school
rate , the teacher who recognizes common causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement , failure , and maladjustment
information about children Successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment
teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist ; ; he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom
be expected , however , to examine and interpret the information already available ; ; to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children ; ; and to utilize opportunities , arising in connection with regular classroom activities , for gaining a better understanding of his pupils
deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher ; ; Chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil progress
Most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils
, when systematically maintained , provide much information about the children , which the teacher can use in guidance , instruction , grouping , and reporting to parents
has in his classroom a metal file , equipped with a lock , which is used to store cumulative record folders
vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal
teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records
teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date
systems provide written instructions to principals and teachers designating when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used
Report On Desegregation Progress In Education In The Middle-South Region , 1959 - 1960 '' clearly shows two pieces of information
Report , which was prepared for this Conference , indicates , first , that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing ; ; second , that both actual and pending desegregation is , with few exceptions , the product or result of court order
together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow
Region , as defined by the National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials ( NAIRO ) , consists of the states of Kentucky , Maryland , Tennessee , West Virginia , Delaware , Virginia and the District of Columbia
and the Nation's Capital all have some desegregation , in fact some dating back to 1954 ; ; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition
been opposed by massive resistance , interposition , pupil assignment ( with no assignments of Negro children ) , and hate bombings
court order Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order

desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties , which already had high school desegregation
was a result of a court order , the citation for which ( and for other court action mentioned in this paper ) is taken from the Summary Report for this Conference
the Harford County Board of Education had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but which a plaintiff had challenged ; ; thus , county school board and Federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation
desegregation in Tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel
further desegregation may come from suits pending in three Tennessee cities , Chattanooga , Knoxville , and Memphis
Virginia the number of white and Negro children attending the same school has increased almost twofold
no court decisions here
Maryland , a District court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in Delaware
result of the State Board of Education plan , Negro children entered heretofore white elementary schools in five districts
Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan
court orders led to desegregation in Charlottesville and Floyd Counties
Pulaski County is pending because of court order , although date of admission is not yet determined
have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in Alexandria , Arlington , Fairfax , and Warren Counties
also result from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs against school boards in Newport News , Fairfax County , Arlington County , and Norfolk
school district , the District of Columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 , shortly after the Supreme Court decision
makes it clear that school desegregation continues , including the Old Dominion State , in spite of its stern resistance
is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order ; ; that on the immediate horizon , if further large-scale ( relatively speaking ) desegregation comes , it will result from court orders on suits filed in several Middle-South states
thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow
to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this Regional Conference , I wish to note a small item in the Summary Report as it refers to the District of Columbia
in the Report is `` continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro school system '' , a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of Negro school population from 74.1 per cent to 76.7 per cent
no real prospects for an all-Negro school population
Rock Creek Park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of Georgetown's conversion-by-renovation housing program
Bottom is ousting Negroes
acreage in the Southwest Redevelopment area beckons white people -- what with high-priced town houses and elevator apartments
Hill rehabilitation , like Foggy Bottom , replaces Negroes with whites ( but also replaces some whites with other whites )
break with tradition , the past and present of `` White Ring Around a Black Core '' , may come with the opening of nearby Montgomery County suburbs to Negro residents and , presumably , the consequent conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the Negro by fleeing to the suburbs
, short of fleeing to Warrenton , Virginia , or Rockville , Maryland , white people may have to live with Negroes
this must be taken into account before the image of an `` all-Negro '' D.C. public school system is conjured up
solve From the Summary Report before us at this Conference , a number of problems are apparent
us and perplex us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems
how can we step up the desegregation movement
slow
we all want more schools where white and Negro together can and do attend
we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color
, members of NAIRO would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone
achieve this objective is a problem , but we are not divided on what we want
as we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves , how can we achieve this action through school board action
be county school board or state school board action , as well as that of municipal school boards
can we reduce the role of the district courts , so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court
a problem , and I believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation
how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools
a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but a continuing program that also promotes integration , that encourages the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro , but as human beings
problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education ; ; not whether it should be done
in the segregated school system , during the period before desegregation , how can we assure equal opportunity
, in the desegregated school system which may have a good many schools with all-Negro population , how can we assure equal opportunity
a problem , but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence
in the segregated school system or in the all-Negro or all-white schools , how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group
help children adjust to `` images of other children '' when the latter are not actually present
the issues If we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion , then there are twice as many issues which , I judge , sharply divide us , intergroup relations practitioners and lay people
1

the one hand school desegregation has come in Virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment , shall we support the plan
basis of pupil assignment criteria , Judge Albert Bryan has assigned Negro children to formerly white schools in Arlington and Alexandria , Virginia
support pupil assignment
other hand , looking at the larger picture , is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off , blocked , or reduced school desegregation to a `` trickle ''
therefore oppose the plan
is an issue because it likely divides us into two camps -- those for or against pupil assignment
2
in order to desegregate
cities like Baltimore , Louisville , and Washington , D.C. , should school desegregation be extended to all-Negro and all-white schools by assigning white and Negro teachers , respectively
one hand do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race
we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other school , we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school -- namely , to a teacher of another race
argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation

in school desegregation cases
part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation
instance the plaintiff was a private citizen
of school districts , indeed , in the entire State of Mississippi , no plaintiff has come forth
have established that the action of municipal , county , or state school boards or boards of education is small , infinitesimally small in comparison with the number of districts
requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement
authorize the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance
in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the Attorney General to act was eliminated , should we nevertheless support such a clause
an issue , for it divides people rather sharply
4
funds to schools that deny children on account of race
the Powell Amendment , which in 1957 divided even a `` liberal '' group like the American Veterans Committee ( AVC )
support a clause in Federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny Federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a child on account of his race
softer than earlier Powell amendments which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts
nonetheless considerable argument against the clause , softened though it be , on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary to the public schools
funds limitation enlists the support of many , the opposition of quite a few

education
political subdivision , state or county or municipality , be required to furnish public education
school year , 1959-1960 , the Prince Edward County ( Virginia ) Board of Supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education , and the school board therefore could provide no public education -- for white or Negro children
education in this American democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education
this subject a matter of self-determination , a matter of states rights or county rights
don't want to provide public education , should they be forced to do so
we marshal substantial agreement behind mandatory public education , we likely cannot expect that all the states will enact the legislation
requirement , which must therefore be Federal in nature , be legislated by the United States Congress
it become law by amendment of the United States Constitution
have two issues in this question -- goal and method
6
for education of the citizens
above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens , Issue No. 6 may be moot
on the other hand , it is not settled , or while it is being debated and resolved , does the Federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in Prince Edward County
the children still receive no education
should the Federal government help
government directly provide education for the children who want public education
question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers
whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way
there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn
issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth
of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education
the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931 - 40 and found `` little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence '' , as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues
cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers , and such issues are not issues of educational policy
, it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy , and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values , which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society
been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy
were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes
currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged
the issue of segregated schools in the South
case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups
the white middle and lower classes are arrayed against the Negro middle and lower classes
may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people
happens , there may be some class conflict in the South , with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position
profession The members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy , their position being strongest in the universities
mostly upper-middle- and lower-middle-class people , with a few in the upper class
make class-biased decisions
society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens these social values , it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society
no problem here
arises , if it does arise , when the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence , but which bears some relation to the social structure
, in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college scholarship , does he consciously or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class
in deciding on the content and method of his teaching , does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the race for higher economic status , or does he favor a curriculum which strengthens students in other ways
to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's own social-class position and also upon his social history , as well as upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator
set of case studies of teachers with various social-class backgrounds , Wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as well as on his social-class background
teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb , while another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations at home , and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment
factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families
experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers
influence is a complex matter , depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience , there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth
have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them ; ; that is , they are likely to favor a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value
not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education , as contrasted with liberal education , but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement value , as against a kind of `` pure '' liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs
no doubt that higher education since World War 2 , has moved away from `` pure '' liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and specialization
several causes for this , one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training
cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social advancement
the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to 1930 , the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of immigrants and more children of urban working-class fathers
is quite in contrast with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born parents , who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum
public interest '' groups Educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in the public interest
one such group , and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation
vote so as to serve their own constituency , and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class , they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education
there are relatively few such political constituencies , and , as has been pointed out , there is seldom a clear-cut distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another
interest group is the commission of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations
commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it
their conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody , and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view
, there have been two Presidential Commissions on higher education since World War 2
Commission on Higher Education tended to take a liberal , expansionist position , while President Eisenhower's Committee on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative
consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people , who attempted to act in the public interest
of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the Commission on the Financing of Higher Education sponsored by the Association of American Universities and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation
recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships
be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias , but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by Byron S. Hollingshead entitled Who Should Go To College
a federal government scholarship program
the Commission set up the Council for Financial Aid to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education
the Commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education
are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations , who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs , experiments , and demonstrations
are practically always upper- or upper-middle-class persons , who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society
are the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the National Association of Parents and Teachers , and the Citizens Committee on Public Schools
an upper-middle-class leadership and a middle-class membership , with rare exceptions , where working-class parents are active in local P.-T.A. matters
other policy-making groups , these are middle class in their educational attitudes , and they attempt to act in the general public interest , as they see it
, it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole
predominantly middle- and upper-class people , and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes
be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account
is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education
of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society
influence social structure through education Educational policy in the United States has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity
far as this goal is achieved , the society becomes more fluid , artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced , and people at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society
other hand , there is a counterbalancing purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children
to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification in the schools
these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions
and cultural opportunity The broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting fluidity within the social structure
ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an example of this movement
past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities , state colleges , and community colleges
of American faith in the comprehensive high school , as expressed in the Conant study , is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity
federal government's student-loan program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to lower-status youth
probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade , because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records ( who were usually middle-class ) , and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges
the private colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds
in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions
however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues
fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service
disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs
the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma
types of fully distributed cost analysis 1
type Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice
explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses
means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution
, or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission
Section distinguishes between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter
costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run out-of-pocket costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist's `` long-run marginal costs ''
a residue of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis
because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has apportioned this residue , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , among the units of carload traffic on a basis ( partly ton , partly ton-mile ) which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination
years , this burden ( which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic
amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet
book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates , it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs
to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable
any event , full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ; and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination

type We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment : the single-step type
be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases
attempt is made , first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' residues of total costs
all of the total costs are treated as variable costs , although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables
whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission parlance `` variable cost '' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output , in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost '' has been used more broadly , so as to cover costs which , while a function of some one variable ( such as output of energy , or number of customers ) , are not necessarily a linear function
noted in an earlier paragraph , the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc.
grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes
power service , for example , would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension distribution lines
major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all , or nearly all , classes of customers ; ; and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates
basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis
turning to this example , we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis , both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type
first subtype , the analyst ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service
an apportionment , say , of $5,000,000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers
the second subtype , which I take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are apportioned directly among the various classes of service
sure , the capital investments in ( or , alternatively , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services
resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a `` return '' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service
during any given year ( A ) if the revenues from the residential service are $7,000,000 , ( B ) if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to $5,000,000 , and ( C ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to $30,000,000 , the cost analyst will report that residential service , in the aggregate , has yielded a return of $2,000,000 or 6-2/3 per cent
will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher
obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably , the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return ''
practice is likely to be misleading , since it may seem to support a conclusion that , as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment , however low , the rates of charge for this service are compensatory
say , any such inference would be quite unwarranted
reason just suggested , I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example
to say , an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment
of the costs of an electric utility business In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant
also assume the existence of only one class or type of service , all of which is supplied at the same voltage , phase , etc. to residential , commercial , and industrial customers
assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions
company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service , we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple ; ; indeed , that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business , followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption
, however , the problem is not so simple
statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output ( or consumption ) of energy
of multiple cost functions is therefore required
division , and the one most frequently used ( with subdivisions ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` volumetric costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs
threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service
, the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge , a $5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours of energy at per kilowatt-hour , and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt -- a total bill of $8 for that month
present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service , and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs
therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes ; ; costs actually vary in much more complex ways

costs These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption
a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer
costs may come to $1 per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial users , who require more costly connections and metering devices
on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates , in the form of a mere `` service charge '' , they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment
really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( low-voltage ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity
of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist
numbers in mathematics , the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth
is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models
not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science
become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models , is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation
to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word `` mass '' to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied
Rapoport , 1959 : : Ch. 11
I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent
pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned
the small group notion involves the implicit claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic or subatomic proportions , the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such entities are valid
exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation
Brodbeck , 1959 : : Ch. 12
parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically formed
supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories
a sifting of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement
sociology may have great practical use in the study of different cultures , yet it is perfectly clear , as Nagel ( 1957 : : 247 - 83 ) and Hempel ( 1959 : : 271 - 307 ) indicate , that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models , in which the notions of teleology , i.e. , metaphysical purpose , are central
Chapter 9
as a sociological credo is , therefore , not a direct consequence of observations , but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment
of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social science
absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology , since the former is a logical , rational discipline , where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical
position entails the negation of philosophy in its Platonic form as something soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences
to Whitehead , philosophy is not a synonym for Plato
of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism
when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences , to dictate the conditions of empirical research , it becomes formal metaphysics ; ; shaping the contours of life to fit the needs of legends
of philosophy as Queen Bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political ideology , but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social sciences
Wetter , 1952 : : Pt. 2 , Ch. 5 ; ; Horowitz 1957b
is no longer a direct grappling with nature as it was in antiquity
surrendered any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness , as in Heidegger's system ( 1929 )
mocked for wishing to know nothing of Nothing , in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of men
not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality by distinguishing between description and prescription
simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century
traditional `` four fields '' of philosophy : logic , ethics , epistemology and esthetics
a commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological criteria , they move away from philosophy as such
left to traditional systems of philosophy is , in effect , only the history of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by the canons of scientific method
situation , philosophy has survived by separating itself from metaphysics , by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions
by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sorts
new situation , philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences , a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value
, philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry , but within its potential domain of relevance
connection , it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were exploited
Kant formulated the nebular hypothesis , according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas , nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by Laplace in his Systeme Du Monde
not mean that philosophy resolves the problems it generates , any more so than Riemann's geometry settled the physical status of the space-time continuum
forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a monumental task
raised on Marcel's Homo Viator and Heidegger's das Nichtige , this may seem a modest role for philosophy
modesty and triviality are different qualities
of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve
effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a more durable sort of drama
fundamental premises in the social sciences , and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands of each new scientific discipline , philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding
prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed
of scientific theory , the examination of a theory from the vantage-points of language , epistemology , and ethics , is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge , no less so because of its removal from empirical research
of science , whatever the degree of precision in formulations , covers the range of prediction and explanation
Hempel and Oppenheim , 1948 : : 135 - 75
philosophy is conceived to be , its rationalist , logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science
forms of philosophy , this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter
Leroy announce that `` the secret is the center of a philosophy '' and thereafter a hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity
simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous
Merleau-Ponty indicated ( 1953 ) , it is not the secret which is important , but the removal of secrecy
, philosophy and science share a common goal
of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument ; ; for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science
of metaphysical systems does not imply the demise of philosophy , only the close of a philosophic age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical
with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science , religion and ideology
McGlynn : 1958
systems , and this includes even the relation of mechanist to relativist physics , are built upon , refined and corrected
, by the very nature of their completeness , are overthrown by rival systems
to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics , they differ in that science is essentially descriptive , while philosophy in its inherited forms , tends to be goal-oriented , teleological and prescriptive
notion that belief , unlike behaviour , is not subject to objective analysis , has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge , since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable than social behaviour
with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge , or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas , one has to become necessarily selective
we have touched upon : philosophy as a logical , deductive system from which a social science methodology can be built up ; ; philosophic analysis of the assumptions and presumptions of the social sciences ; ; and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigations
will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted , namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in the social sciences
it will be asked whether the `` real '' questions people ask are not the `` ultimate '' questions that social science finds itself impotent in the face of
is the status of such questions as : is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual goal
develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals
really exist as an entity over and above the agglomeration of men
it must be said that , contrary to metaphysical insistence , these are questions so framed as to defy either empirical exploration or rational solutions
( 1908 ) and Dilthey ( 1922 ) indicated , questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions , but assertions of faith made to appear as legitimate questions
assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals
has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions , than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the wave-particle controversy
not that such questions are not asked
rather that introducing them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty
approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty , since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or reshapes
the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds , answers to ultimate questions having an irrational rather than scientific basis , is in a real sense to undermine the objection itself
concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational , i.e. , for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and irrational
which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence in the shortcomings of men , an impatience with partial , tentative solutions
always lived in a tentative world , and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary
itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world
uncertainty we are left with a set of dogmas and myths
interplay of philosophy and science should , as a minimum , guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making
of indefiniteness is a salutary condition for the growth of science
was the statement empirical , for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard
they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value
a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically , and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery
that the theory could be saved in one way only
could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest
the course the positivists took
value judgments by explaining them away
do not think their view will do
discussing it , I should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case
been said of John Stuart Mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out
has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply
claims to show by analysis that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking
argue that we do mean to do just that
work through an example , and the simpler and commoner the better
perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad
take a set of circumstances in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement
upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use
signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger , pain , and fear , it has all but eaten off its own leg
failed : the animal is now dead
think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` It was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so ''
tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion
, on the contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain itself , namely , that it was bad -- bad when and as it occurred
follows from the positivist view
view , nothing good or bad happened in the case until I came on the scene and made my remark
I express in my remark is something going on in me at the time , and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene
of the rabbit was not itself bad ; ; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured ; ; badness , in the only sense in which it is involved at all , waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt
this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows
put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered
prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did

we should say , on the contrary , that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal's pain , that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not
, then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only
saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it
argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference
our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds it should be
argument applies the method in the reverse way
removes the past event , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds it should not
suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing
positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second
only sense in which badness is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there
question is , is such an implication consistent with what we meant
is not
asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken
that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering , seems to me merely frivolous
did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred
theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about
theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition
as I can see , there is only one way out for the positivist
that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval
is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself
in itself was neutral ; ; but unfortunately the rabbit , on no grounds at all , took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time , and in the only intelligible sense , bad
of escape is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not , so far as I know , been urged by positivists , it is perhaps best not to spend time over it
now to a third argument , which again is very simple
come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing , we presumably make it with some feeling ; ; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling
that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again
that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded
evidence is no longer before us ; ; and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is , as we say , quite dead
circumstances , since what was expressed by the remark when first made is , on the theory before us , simply absent , the remark now expresses nothing
as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it
seems to me untrue
repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing , the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer Yes
say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time , but that it was the same point we were making
we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero , it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express
now to a fourth consideration
believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not ; ; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense
Ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics , and I suspect they are right
is not exactly my point
is this : whether there is such fitness or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do
illustrate
novel The House Of The Dead , Dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison camp
unhappy inmates of such camps are like today , Dostoevsky's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined
have heard stories '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions , of the most monstrous murders , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter ''
us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting
were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong , and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting
the subjectivist view , this answer is ruled out
someone takes up an attitude toward death , suffering , or their infliction , they have no moral quality at all
therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting
in themselves neutral , and , so far as they get a moral quality , they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker
that is true , why is any attitude more fitting than any other
, for example , be fitting if , apart from the applause , there were nothing good to applaud
be fitting if , independently of the condemnation , there were nothing bad to condemn
a case , any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point
we are forced to go much farther
and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line
is nothing evil in these things , if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them , why shouldn't they be greeted with a cheer
them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; ; it would needlessly bring badness into the world ; ; and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright
other hand , to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good ; ; it would bring goodness into the world
German veteran was a former miner , twenty-four years old , who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head
in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also
event , the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch remained essentially intact
is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images , a condition in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence
in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that , when the patient closed his eyes , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness whatsoever
inference , as the authors themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( ( 1 ) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch , as such
not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself
) Spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations ; ; that is , there is , in the true sense , only a visual space ''
assumption , of course , is that only sight and touch enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way , to locate objects in space beyond us , the other senses being decidedly inferior , if not totally inadequate , in this regard
an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel
if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled , the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary
of the authors' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered
) What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed
) What evidence is there that he was psychically blind
) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury
consider these in the inverse order of their presentation
a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative , if the argument is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion , any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion
the authors give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance
as follows : `` The usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness ( pressure , pain , temperature ) , as well as the kinesthetic sensations ( muscular feelings , feelings in the tendons and joints ) , were , as such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in comparison with normal reactions , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body
tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member , as well as the direction and scope of a movement , passively executed ( with one of his members ) , proved to have been , on the contrary , very considerably affected ''
insist , however , that these abnormalities in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight
all , what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged
) When an object was placed in the patient's hand , he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; ; and he could tell , simply by the feel of it , whether it was made of wood , iron , cloth , rubber , and so on
could recognize , by touch alone , articles which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; ; that is , he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was
) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade
his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight , the patient had to train himself for a new line of work , that of a portfolio-maker , an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour
clear , when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question , the one concerning the psychical blindness of the patient ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision
the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more than the foregoing facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; ; or , to put the same thing in physiological terms , that the performance-capacity of the tactual apparatus , from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain , -- that is , from one end to the other -- was unimpaired ''
argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point , it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective visual condition
we can do this , we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 ; ; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand
ways , then , did the patient's psychical blindness manifest itself
not see objects as unified , self-contained , and organized figures , as a person does with normal vision
of this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects ; ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again
he constantly became lost in parts and components of them , confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects , and so on , unless he allowed time to `` trace '' the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours
his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more or less indefinite size ; ; at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether
the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; ; could piece , as it were , the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned out to be
however , the figure to be discerned were complicated , composed of several interlocking subfigures , and so on , even the tracing process failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts
, concretely , that the patient could not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or body , became easily confused by `` hasher marks '' inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters , and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it
himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all ; ; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him
conversation with another man , he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like
he call up memory-pictures of close friends or relatives
, both his own declarations and his figural blindness , when he looked at objects , seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all
oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape , already learned and held in visual memory , as persons of normal vision do
not recognize it ; ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all
his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object ; ; and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure
might finally recognize it , apparently by combining the visual blot , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements
mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience , the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery
would surmise , the procedure , however , could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape , which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference
trees , automobiles , houses , and so on -- objects continually confronted in everyday life -- had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable , at the very beginning of tracing , by an inference as to what each was
for example , he inferred from black dots on a white surface
could not actually see the corners of these objects , but their size and the dots gave them away
authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it
seems even to have been able to guess correctly , without the tracing motions , solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared in his visual experience
very important question -- What is , then , exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things
now been raised in the reader's mind and in the following form
patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations , at least in regard to two dimensions , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors
then , do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this
set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned away from the object concerned )
, they make the investigation , first , by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to
patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all , the following striking results occurred
, indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality ( see Plate 6a , 9b ) ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century
of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment
least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line
, again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life
an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure
of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds
work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself
vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the Geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek world
century was in its artistic work `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future '' , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated
in 800 B.C. Geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it deserves , partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at Argos , are only now coming to light
a cursory inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the Aegean world down to 800 B.C.
intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree
was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800
process the Minoan-Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800
scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct ; ; but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium
of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of the Greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the Geometric style of pottery
vases usually turn up , especially outside Greece proper , together with as many or more examples of local stamp , these `` non-Greek '' patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century
place came local variations within the common style -- tentative , as it were , in Protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed
though important , was not the only teacher of this age
take a vase of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge of its place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable
of the Aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland , and in Greece itself Argive , Corinthian , Attic , Boeotian , and other Geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks
variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half
conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages
B.C. the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture
pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the Iliad
the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; ; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors
cannot go , for the Dark ages deserve their name
of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure
poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men -- all these had to await the progress of following decades
have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search
the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces
, indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period
can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding
Dark ages , it is clear , the Greek world had been developing slowly but consistently
could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the Aegean stood on firm ground
the early eighth century the landscape of Greek history broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century B.C. , the age of Homer's `` rosy-fingered Dawn ''
slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world ; ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change
period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death
simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in Greece ; ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous
was practiced in the Aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful
is not easy to apply the evidence of the Iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750
Geometric pottery of Athens and the Iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek civilization ; ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending
was swirling toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth
was well under way before 700 B.C. , and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century
, however , is Janus-faced
tokens point forward , the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the Dark ages
pottery of the century was Geometric ; ; political organization revolved about the basileis ; ; trade was just beginning to expand ; ; the gods who protected the Greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress
student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century
men of the period would have accepted this emphasis
clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized
is not possible to sunder old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization
principle of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; ; for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself
contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750
not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early Greece ; ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models
of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past
the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe Geometric
yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance
which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style
aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines
centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos
had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses
, in particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing , elaborate motifs , and the curving lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe
vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization , at first hesitantly in Protogeometric work , and then more confidently in the initial stages of the Geometric style
social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple plane ; ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments
potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited
respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress
ancestral lore , however , new materials were added
less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; ; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep
, feather-like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized rows , animals in solemn frieze bands ( see Plates 11 - 12 ) -- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze
of animals and birds , in particular , suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes , transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek
spread of this type of decoration in the Aegean has not yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century
material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident
illustrates four examples , which are Ripe or Late Geometric work of common spirit but of different schools
discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and , when he could not show the hide , arrested him
evidence insufficient to get a conviction , he later released him
suffering the trip to his home , Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he would kill the Indian
later , following his recovery , armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney , Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez
daybreak , they found Julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender
he whirled and ran to his house for a gun , forcing them to kill him , Cook reported
and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the killing , but the company officers felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion
Pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished
17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased
with Julian M. Beall , Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house for a while , rode away
nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and began riding down the stream
traveled only a short distance when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them
ambush , the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill
two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in Catskill , the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business
with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock Saturday morning passed the old Garnett Lee ranch
mile below at the mouth of Salyer's Canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from A. J. Armstrong , occupied by a Mexican , his wife , and an old trapper
three houses in Salyer's Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff , the road winding along the top , entering above , and then passing down in front of the houses , thence to the Vermejo
west of this road was another low bluff , forty or fifty feet high , covered with scrub oak and other brush
were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs , a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers
bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush , but one hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm , passing on through his body
first reports , Russell's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook , followed by a hail of bullets , raced towards the arroyo of Salyer's Canyon immediately in front of him , just reaching it as his horse fell
Winchester from its sheath , Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank
so thick , throwing sand in his face , that he found it difficult to return the fire
horse in front of the long log building , he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight , so he began working his way down the ditch to join him
very shallow place , two Mexicans rushed into the open for a shot
one knee , Cook felled one , and the other struggled off with his comrade , sending no further fire in his direction
leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed , he did hear shots down at the house
reached the house as Cook surmised , dismounted , but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him , he fell into the trapper's arms -- dead
fired by one of the Mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head , tearing a hole two-inches square on the outgoing side
dead , Cook caught Russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins
Sunday morning , a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of Catskill followed the trail to the house of Francisco Chaves , where 100 to 150 Mexicans had gathered
approached the fortified adobe house and demanded entrance
inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid
demanded the names of the injured men ; ; the Mexicans not only refused to give them , but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it
strength of the Mexicans had been underrated , too small a posse had been collected , and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants , MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw
retreat encouraged the Mexicans to be overbearing and impudent
following week , six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned ; ; some buildings , farm tools , two horses , plows , and hay owned by Bonito Lavato , a friendly interpreter for the company , and Pedro Chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed ; ; and a store was broken into and robbed
M. W. Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms -- he just didn't catch anyone
on his life finally convinced Cook that he should leave New Mexico
advised that it would be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense , perpetuating the troubles
summer , he wrote from Laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad way financially , so Pels sent him a draft for $100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return
sent a check for $100 to Russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave
and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing position
reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot
law virtually ignored the situation
became ill just as the Colfax District Court convened , no substitute was brought in , no criminal cases heard , only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried , and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks
: `` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business ; ; public money spent ; ; justice delayed ; ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolute farce ''
the company that the man behind these depredations was Manuel Gonzales , a man with many followers , including a number who were kept in line through fear of him
by the sheriff for killing an old man named Asher Jones , the warrant for his arrest had never been served
19 , a deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left Maxwell City and rode thirty-five miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan Jose Martinez
A.M. they reached his house and found it vacant
were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby , they smashed down the door , broke the window , and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room
was no Gonzales and the family would say nothing
yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square
around these buildings , two of the posse recognized the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside
promised that no harm would befall him if he would come out , but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door
then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive
refused
earnest , the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside , only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor
became obvious that he could stay inside no longer , taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside , square against the muzzle of a Winchester
the heart , he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away , three bullets following him
pushed open the door he fell on his face , one of his comrades pulling him inside
the seriousness of the wound , the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him
answer , they set the fire
house was about half consumed , his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands , declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel
true that he was not inside , the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket
fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand
or eight times the body was draped with Russell's pistol , belt , and cartridges
no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who , though numbering in the fifties , had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack
next morning , a Mexican telephoned Pels that Celso Chavez , one of the posse members , was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father's home on the upper Vermejo
and District Attorney Mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed , according to signed statements by Chavez and Dr. I. P. George , and ordered Deputy Barney Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman
night , Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock May 22
heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills , disappearing at the posse's approach
justice of the peace had issue a writ against Chavez for taking part in the `` murder '' of Manuel Gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger
helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along with three other families desiring to leave
or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large , and Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe houses , defending themselves through loopholes , it would be most difficult to capture them
wired J. P. Lower and Sons of Denver : `` Have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot
, how long to order and what is the price ''
decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup , particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard
then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean out the Vermejo by force immediately
was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant
Depot Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality , and assessments were made for its maintenance
given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the Battenkill
No. 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment
on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street
homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of School Street are served by it
Connell is the present treasurer and manager
town meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center , Depot , and Way's Lane
submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report
of the sewer lines was designed by Henry W. Taylor , who was the engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant
were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town
town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities
step was a vote for a $230,000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by the 1959 town meeting , later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town meeting June 21 , 1960
matter stands with the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams
telegraph Manchester's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the Rev. J. D. Wickham , headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary , was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor , Samuel F. B. Morse
rate , Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington
Matthew B. Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont ''
telegrapher for the `` American Telegraph Company '' and the `` Troy and Canada Junction Telegraph Company ''
capital stock at $15 each in the latter company were payable at the Bank of Manchester or at various other Vermont banks
of less than fifteen words to Bennington cost twenty-five cents
L. C. Orvis , manager of the `` Western Union Telegraph Company '' , expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village drugstore
needed to hire an assistant , Clark J. Wait
Journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business
fall of 1878 , the `` Popular Telegraph Line '' was established between Manchester and Factory Point by the owners , Paul W. Orvis , Henry Gray , J. N. Hard , and Clark J. Wait
soon lived up to its name , as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock
the same Clark Wait , with H. H. Holley of South Dorset , formed the `` American Telegraph Line '' , extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and South Dorset to Dorset
most convenient , the line `` soon proved a good investment for the owners ''
the Depot at this time were Aaron C. Burr and Mark Manley of `` Burr and Manley '' , dealers in lumber and dry goods
was very flimsy ; ; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles , making communications impossible
continued to spring up
the `` Battenkill Telegraph Company '' was in existence and Alvin Pettibone was its president
1887 was the `` Valley Telegraph Line '' , officers of which were E. C. Orvis , president ; ; H. K. Fowler , vice-president and secretary ; ; J. N. Hard , treasurer ; ; F. H. Walker , superintendent ; ; H. S. Walker , assistant superintendent
now had headquarters with Clark J. Wait , who by then had his own drugstore at Factory Point -- the `` Northern Union Telegraph Company '' and the `` Western Union ''
Arthur Koop and Norman Taylor
on a `` Northern Union '' telegraph form is a typical peremptory message from Peru grocer J. J. Hapgood to Burton and Graves' store in Manchester -- `` Get and send by stage four pounds best Porterhouse or serloin stake , for Mrs. Hapgood send six sweet oranges ''
J. E. McNaughton of Barnumville and E. G. Bacon became proprietors of the `` Green Mountain Telegraph Company '' , connecting all offices on the Western Union line and extending over the mountain from Barnumville to Peru , Londonderry , South Londonderry , Lowell Lake , Windham , North Windham , Grafton , Cambridgeport , Saxton's River , and Bellows Falls
until 1910 John H. Whipple was manager of Western Union at the Center in the drugstore he purchased from Clark Wait
office of Western Union with George Towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in Hard's drugstore until 1905
summers , Towsley often needed the assistance of a company operator
the years when people flocked to Manchester not only to play golf , which had come into vogue , but also to witness the Ekwanok Country Club tournaments
were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers
local telegraph business and Manchester basked in all the free advertising
when the town was chosen for the U. S. Amateur Golf tournament , a representative hurried here from the Boston manager's office
wake came the District Traffic Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of Boston's best , chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf
tournament alone , some 250,000 words winged their way out of Manchester
Morse system was replaced locally by the Simplex modern automatic method in 1929 , when Ellamae Heckman ( Wilcox ) was manager of the Western Union office
, business was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox had two assistants and a messenger
succeeded by Clarence Goyette
time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town clerk's office and drugstore at the Village
located for some years in the Village at the Equinox Pharmacy under the supervision of Mrs. Harry Mercier , it is presently located in the Hill and Dale Shop , Manchester Center
known telephone line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and Manley's store at Manchester Depot and the Kent and Root Marble Company in South Dorset
extended the following year to include the railroad station agent's office and Thayer's Hotel at Factory Point
1887 a line connecting several dwelling houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester Depot
from Louis Dufresne's house in East Manchester to the Dufresne lumber job near Bourn Pond were up about 1895
Taylor of Manchester Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East Dorset and Barnumville in his diary for 1906
have been for local calls strictly , as in May 1900 the `` only long distance telephone '' in town was transferred from C. B. Carleton's to Young's shoe store
single switchboard was installed in the Village over Woodcock's hardware store ( later E. H. Hemenway's )
was manager and troubleshooter ; ; Elizabeth Way was the first operator ; ; and a night operator was also employed
enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the Manchester Journal
the New England Telephone Company began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of U. S. Rte. 7 and what is now Memorial Avenue at Manchester Center
through Barnumville and to Bennington County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the `` Gleason Telephone Company '' in 1925 , but major supervision of telephone lines in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company , which eventually gained all control
and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business
Mrs. F. H. Briggs , agent and chief operator , who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years' service , led agency offices in sales for the year with $2,490
, who retired in 1938 , was a veteran of thirty-four years' local service
telephone operator was Edith Fleming Blackmer , who had been in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960
Dorset received its own exchange , which made business easier for the Manchester office , but it was not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester and Dorset
toll calls between the two towns
month , calls were up seventy per cent
electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use
has to go back only some sixty years
mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben Colvin's and Houghton's gristmill on the West Branch in Factory Point
are available as to the date or extent of installation , but it may have been in 1896
14 , 1900 the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for Edward S. Isham at `` Ormsby Hill ''
working by the end of August and giving satisfactory service
1900 surveying was done under John Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant
of it , perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage
step was construction by the Manchester Light and Power Company of a plant on the west bank of the Battenkill south of Union Street bridge
nearly completed May 23 , 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10 , but the first light did not go on until September 28
at the end of the sidewalk in front of the Dellwood Cemetery cottage
directors of the Manchester Light and Power Company were John Marsden , M. L. Manley , William F. Orvis , George Smith , and John Blackmer
were John Marsden , president ; ; John C. Blackmer , vice-president ; ; George Smith , treasurer ; ; and William F. Orvis , secretary
manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company , the Colonial Light and Power Company , for one year
the time the Marsden enterprise was getting under way , the Vail Light and Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery , intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity
had two competing power companies until 1904 , when the Manchester Light and Power Company purchased the transmission system of the Vail Company
fortunate , as the Vail plant burned in 1905
Light and Power Company was succeeded by the Vermont Hydro-Electric Corporation , which in turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation
now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at Manchester Depot which was put into operation February 19 , 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger transformers
time following the abandonment of the local plant , electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the Vermont Marble Company system to the north
have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention ''
to this view , two points are worth making
it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay ''
the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay ''
overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn
that a man could be both serious and gay
writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of
to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself
it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent
return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr
still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity
he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom
not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus's philological study of the New Testament
exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century
writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works
on the margins of modernity for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia
evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so
other contemporary of More's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work -- Niccolo Machiavelli and The Prince
discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response
in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern
was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St. Thomas More , the martyr
whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian Humanism , the Renaissance elements are of primary concern
we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; ; we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ; we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia
new about it
question the answer is simple ; ; it can be made in two words , Utopian communism
is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials
is nothing new about communism
it in Plato's Republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book
it in that `` common way of life pleasing to Christ and still in use among the truest societies of Christians '' , that is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity
it in the later Stoic conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions
was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle Ages ; ; and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it
the idea of communism is very old even in More's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as such that we are concerned with
concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; ; we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it
way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory
achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not
Republic communism is -- to speak anachronistically -- a communism of Janissaries
is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite
it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; ; and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns
Utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass
applies to all Utopians
the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central
of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; ; and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering
Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes
community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself
monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors , their spiritual athleticism
the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time , although it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the Middle Ages
tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man
not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned
function of patristic communism was adequately set forth by St. Gregory almost a millenium before More wrote Utopia
soil is common to all men
give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs
think of it more as an act of justice than compassion ''
not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his
of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian
a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping
to this Stoic-patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve
brace conscience with legal sanctions
properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still
the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role
one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced
not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks
like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing
not merely a new thing ; ; it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; ; most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism
say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; ; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine's encounter with man
indeed , is Luther's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at
communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice
features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; ; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; ; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; ; even houses changed once a decade ; ; six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; ; no private property , no money ; ; no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term
merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist
not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details
spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late Antiquity
Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration of Independence
Brown trial , however , the state's most powerful Democratic newspaper , the Providence Daily Post , stated that Brown was a murderer , a man of blood , and that he and his associates , with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists , had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments
Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that `` He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states ''
major newspapers in Providence continued , throughout the crisis , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history
Daily Post continued to accuse Republicans and the Daily Journal continued to accuse Democrats , the Woonsocket Patriot complained that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn Brown and his men
stated , `` Of their guilt there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial , and a fair trial ''
Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings
Daily Journal stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident , the South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace
31 , 1859 , John Brown was found guilty of treason against the state of Virginia , inciting slave rebellion , and murder
crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday , December 2 , 1859
the news , Northern writers , editors , and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states , particularly Virginia
Islanders were preparing for the state elections , they watched John Brown's trial with extreme interest
morning , November 2 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown justly deserved the extreme penalty , no man , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty without a fair trial
main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted
of the Providence Daily Post , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old Brown '' had a fair trial
sentence the editor asked , `` What else can Virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws , organized treason , and butchered her citizens ''
eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction to Brown's trial and sentence were basically identical
Smith , editor of the Warren Telegraph stated that `` the ends of justice must be satisfied , a solitary example must be set , in order that all those misnamed philantropists , who , actuated by a blind zeal , dare to instigate riot , treason , and murder , may heed it and shape their future course accordingly ''
of the Newport Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital punishment
contrast to the other Rhode Island editors , Samuel S. Foss of the Woonsocket Patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair
sentence , Foss wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy shall override vengeance and that John Brown's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment , it would be well -- well for the country and for Virginia ''
excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown , Rhode Islanders turned their attention to the state elections
had elected Republican candidates in the past two years
no doubt as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the state
failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by majorities , the failure was due to a lingering remnant of the Know-Nothing party , which called itself the American Republican party
Republicans and the Republicans both nominated Lieutenant-Governor Turner for governor
Potter was the Democratic candidate
of the election of 1859 found Republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two Congressional offices from the eastern and western sections of the state
month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers
7 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal reprinted a letter sent to John Brown from `` E. B. '' , a Quaker lady in Newport
to Brown's raid she wrote , `` though we are non-resistants and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons , we know thee was anemated by the most generous and philanthropic motives ''
B. '' compared John Brown to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression
to `` E. B. '' , most Rhode Islanders hardly thought of John Brown as being another Moses
to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in Rhode Island
evening , November 23 , 1859 , in Warren , Rev. Mark Trafton of New Bedford , gave a `` Mission of Sympathy '' lecture in which he favorably viewed the Harper's Ferry insurrection
Telegraph stated that many of Rev. Trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism
account of the Trafton lecture , the Providence Daily Post said that the remarks of Rev. Trafton made the people indignant
or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy
Daily Journal , however , stated that Brown's courage , bravery , and heroism `` in a good cause would make a man a martyr ; ; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one ''
Patriot admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. Wise or James Buchanan ''
Mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him
letter to John Brown , `` E. B. '' , the Quakeress from Newport , had suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington
latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution , it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in `` E. B.'s '' suggestion
22 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal stated that although Brown's `` pluck '' and honest fanaticism must be admired , any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions
later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution
of the Daily Journal warned , `` that if such a demonstration be made , it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence ''
Daily Post's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence
called upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace
2 , 1859 , John Brown was hanged at Charles Town , Virginia
were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold
Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled
not the case in Rhode Island
public demonstration in honor of John Brown was held at Pratt's Hall in Providence , on the day of his execution
opposition of the city newspapers , the Pratt Hall meeting `` brought together a very respectable audience , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery , of many of our colored citizens , and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering ''
the platform were Amos C. Barstow , ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer ; ; Thomas Davis , an uncompromising Garrisonian ; ; the Reverend Augustus Woodbury , a Unitarian minister ; ; the Reverend George T. Day , a Free-Will Baptist ; ; Daniel W. Vaughan , and William H. H. Clements
two were appointed secretaries
speaker was Amos C. Barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting
of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John Brown of Harper's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island's colonial period
that as Rhode Island's John Brown became a canonized hero , if not a saint , so would it be with John Brown of Harper's Ferry
speaker was George T. Day
Brown's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; ; his deed was not below , but above the law ''
was Woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of Brown's attempt at servile insurrection , his admiration of Brown's character , and his opposition to slavery
were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing
and last speaker was Thomas Davis
time large numbers of the audience had left the hall
his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city
that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments
remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they `` are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned ''
that in Rhode Island a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man ( Thomas W. Dorr ) proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty
close of Davis' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president , and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously : Whereas , John Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper : Therefore , Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects , yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom , we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor
his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice
the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action
that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible
morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the Providence Daily Journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes , it could have been avoided completely
being deceived , the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture
and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny , the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances
, and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography , Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint ; ; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas
other pictures , however , Braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing
, by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ; that is , by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface
of such devices , however , soon had the effect of telescoping , even while separating , surface and depth
of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion
for this reason , and no other that I can see , that in September 1912 , Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper , instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint
that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas
true that his first collage looks more Analytical than Braque's , which would confirm the date he assigns it
is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography ; ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910
examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each
makes no real difference that Braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal , while Picasso's is on canvas and eked out in oil
its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done
again , the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim
illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives way in turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither
the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign
now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before
isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it , and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture
surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns out -- suddenly and paradoxically -- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of , upon , the surface
very first collages , Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth , so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real , bas-relief space -- or to be about to do so -- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface
surface is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast
upper center of Braque's first collage , Fruit Dish ( in Douglas Cooper's collection ) , a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane
illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses , but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it
violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper , and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering , manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not `` jump ''
same time , the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them , and by their placing in relation to the block capitals ; ; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing , and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining
part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane ; ; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface
same thing , more or less , can be said of the contents of Picasso's first collage
collages of both masters , a variety of extraneous materials are used , sometimes in the same work , and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of
adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a painted-in form -- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth
as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space , and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially
expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it
now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself -- at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a pictorial illusion
Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind , but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind -- and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness ; ; rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness , re-creates it
this re-created literalness , the Cubist subject reemerged
had turned out , by a further paradox of Cubism , that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging
Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it ; ; they had also had to generalize it -- to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself
to be saved , plasticity had had to be isolated ; ; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable
in its 1911-1912 phase ( which the French , with justice , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge of abstract art
then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with a unique dilemma : they had to choose between illusion and representation
opted for illusion , it could only be illusion per se -- an illusion of depth , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects
on the other hand , they opted for representation , it had to be representation per se -- representation as image pure and simple , without connotations ( at least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed
the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive alternatives
end , Picasso and Braque plumped for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately
provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about `` reality ''
the inner , formal logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision
smaller facet-planes of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage , they had to coalesce -- become `` synthesized '' -- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane
their previous atom-like smallness , they would have cut away too abruptly into depth ; ; and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane
juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes ; ; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject )
because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913
came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; ; nor did Synthetic Cubism fully begin there
the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities
began with Picasso alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; ; this was the point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from Braque , never again to relinquish it
before that , Picasso had glimpsed and entered , for a moment , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him
as though , in that instant , he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back -- or forward -- to literal three-dimensionality
did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage ( and of Cubism in general ) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane
in 1912 , Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar ; ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings , thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane
elements of collage were extruded , as it were , and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief
in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper
without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices
the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever
interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York
hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls `` the highest and best use '' of centrally located urban land
affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services
land values without taking away land ; ; freeways boost valuation less ( because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed
Angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking lot and garage -- one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics has already come to pass
with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary
do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might
freeway plans may be more successful -- especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised , allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the ramp
the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance
greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in `` industrial parks '' removed from the city's political jurisdiction
of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor
industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency engineers usually believe in them , and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers
of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe
merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities
factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities -- the rubber factories in Akron , Chrysler's Detroit plants , U.S. Steel's Pittsburgh works -- often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport ( river ) , storage ( piers ) and power ( river )
leapfrog '' was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet blighted
and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site
combustion became cheap , he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes
siding is still important -- it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking
who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad
are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory
, General Electric's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse , the Pentagon , Boeing in Seattle , Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere -- none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit
all suburban plants , relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers
the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry
along Massachusetts' Route 128 , the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston , may be a vision of the future
could be worse
along Route 128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks and trees
even be rather grand , like Edward Land's monument to the astonishing success of Polaroid
deny the values of the city -- the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the `` melting pot '' which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities
segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities
interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts' Route 128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly
factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the city's periphery
the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities
loss of hotel business to the outskirt's motel has been relatively painless ; ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every year
most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public transit is feeble
, of course , always spreads with the population -- grocery stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress shops , candy stores and the like
a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago -- a new bedroom set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior -- the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest
congregated in the `` one hundred per cent location '' , where all the transit lines converged
are still there , but the volume of the `` downtown store '' has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban `` branch '' sells more and more dry goods
retailer and hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank
discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated
shopping-center branch -- not even Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit -- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store
distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax
branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened
which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are
cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store
the competition -- always a great motivating force in the American economy -- makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new branches
seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches
the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover
has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of American retailing
the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store , though both are the same distance from home
there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown
reports that residents of East St. Louis have been driving across the Mississippi , through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town
extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus , Ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door
distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program
the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with `` nice people '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store , the central location may be in serious trouble
according to land economist Homer Hoyt , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's Central Business Districts put together
store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind
may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children's clothing ( taking the kid downtown is too much of a production ) , household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items
were built on dry goods , especially ladies' fashions , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown
analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's cost accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather than major factors
America the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered
ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm ''
question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree
usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown
radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference -- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us

Negroes In their book , American Skyline , Christopher Tunnard and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility -- a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote
superhighways -- New York's Henry Hudson and Chicago's Lake Shore , San Francisco's Bay Bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the Pennsylvania Turnpike -- were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression
same time , Roosevelt's Federal Housing Administration , coupled with Henry Morgenthau's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes
had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U. S. government ; ; householders who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent , under government aegis
itself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington
generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution , and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find
is a great conception
ceiling , with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky : the closed frieze , formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls , belong in their large ordering to the line of Correggio and his Baroque followers
may be remote , but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the United States
designed the decorative scheme as a whole , in collaboration with the architect Charles U. Walter , at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure
years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco , and slightly less than half the frieze , beginning with the Liberty group opposite the East door , and ending with William Penn , all but one leg , when a tragic accident ended his career
at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle
carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini , who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania and noting in pencil , in Italian , that he `` began at this point ''
had used up all the sketches thirty-six feet of empty frieze were left over
undecorated void , plastered in roughcast , disfigured the wall of the Rotunda until 1951
advised by the Architect of the Capitol , the Joint Committee for the Library , traditionally responsible for the works of art in the building , ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco , to show `` the Peace after the Civil War '' , `` the Spanish-American War '' , and `` the Birth of Aviation '' , to match as nearly as feasible Brumidi's technique and composition
cleaning and restoration were ordered , first of the older part of the frieze , finally of the canopy
is therefore a description of three separate undertakings , the new frescoing of the gap , and the successive essays in conservation , with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each
use of students and future restorers , a full , day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings , complete technical reports on what we found and what we did
be consulted in the office of the Architect of the Capitol , or the Library of Congress
preliminary was inspecting the unfinished length of frieze , a jumble of roughcast and finish coats , all in bad condition
decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks , and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists' preparation , with a mortar , one part slaked lime , three parts sand , to be put on in two layers
drawn full size , after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities
some difficulty here
to manage the given subjects , three diverse recent events , so as to make them part of a classical frieze , -- that is , a pattern of large figures filling the space , with not much else , against a blank background
all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length Brumidi allowed for each one of his
was all arranged to fit , and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze , the cartoons were tried in place
, a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above , was strong and safe , but obscured visibility
be seen from the floor , but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses ; ; and we were able to decide on some amplification of scale
sure of matching color as well as form , pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast , and large samples painted in fresco , then left two months to dry out to their final key
was gratifying to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came
was the length of the space to be painted
of Brumidi and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order , though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust
they came out surprisingly clear and bright
be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster , one half inch , and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described by Cennino Cennini in the 14th Century , and current in Italy to this day
, they used opaque color throughout , getting solid highlights with active lime white
a secco '' is much in evidence
hatching reinforces and broadens shadows , and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat
is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint
own practice , to have the last `` intonaco '' plaster coat thick enough to match , and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying , we found that it had to be put on in two layers , letting the first set awhile before applying the second
was three parts sand to two of lime
the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us ; ; but to make it stiffer , of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking , we added a little hydrated lime -- hard on the hands , but we could see no other disadvantage
told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting
was , it took the pigment well for six hours , enough for our purpose , and held it firmly in setting
obvious that to match Brumidi , white must be mixed with all but the darkest tones
, hard and brilliant , has a tendency to `` jump '' away from the other colors in drying , and also by its capacity to set , to preclude the use of ready-made gradations , so useful in decorative work
Italian practice , lime , dried and reground `` bianco sangiovanni '' , entered into such prepared shades
we chose a stronger pigment , unknown to the early Italians or to Brumidi , titanium oxide , reserving the active lime white for highest lights , put on at the end of the day's stint
were mostly raw umber , some burnt umber , and a little yellow ochre
was probably not in Brumidi's palette , but was needed to take the chill , bluish look off the new work next to the old , where softening effects of time were seen , even after thorough cleaning
of `` secco '' we tried to restrict to covering joints
, however , that it is very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven
and Costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem
forced , as they were , to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark areas
it by Doerner's recipe , five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty ; ; ground together they made a strong adhesive , which became waterproof in drying
was taken in 1953
part is finished
right is the Brumidi Liberty group , as it looked after cleaning operations , which had not yet come around to the other end ; ; where , of Costaggini , only some foliage has been washed , at the point where his work stopped
led to speculate as to why the empty space was there , left for our century to finish
it was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle
later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and mutilated his father's designs , ambitiously coveting a bit he could claim for his very own
might be settled by comparing the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions noted , presumably in Brumidi's hand , above the various sections of his long preparatory drawing , which has been kept
, it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his `` histories '' and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of California gold
a fresco , the handling of wet mortar compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right , not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering
very first , then , Brumidi was required , by the classically pyramidal shape of his central group , to fill in the triangular space above the seated girl on Liberty's right , before starting on the allegorical figures themselves
put a small man , whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful , until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning , this was to be the closing figure of the party of `` forty-niners '' , and was to hold a basket
Costaggini's rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away
, Figure 1 of the completed frieze , shows how , having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years , he has now been given a hand , and by juxtaposition ( and the permission of the Committee ) , given a new job , to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903
bright effect of the first washings led the Committee to order the rest of the Brumidi-Costaggini cycle cleaned and restored to go with them
wooden scaffold was removed , and , so as to reach all the frieze , one of pipe , on wheels , built up from the floor
days , in the early morning , as the work progressed , twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the Rotunda pavement , supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting
giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor , after a first dusting , we began to wash
useful tool for wetting the surface without running down was made from a greenhouse `` mist spray '' nozzle welded to a hose connection , to be used at low water pressure
in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower
sprayed , with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting
assistant mopped with two sponges
a repeated sponging was needed , but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original brightness
or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions
`` a fresco '' stood up superbly ; ; a little of the `` secco '' came off
was put on at once
found the craftsmanship first rate , especially Brumidi's
greatly helped by there being no traces of former restoring
more than dusting had ever been done , and not much of that
was sound , the intonaco firmly attached all over , and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places
source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings above , soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime , very conspicuous even after cleaning , particularly in the `` Landing of Columbus '' , `` Oglethorpe and the Indians '' , and `` Yorktown ''
Architect , referring to the use of the Capitol as a public building , not a museum , requested some repainting to maintain decorative effect , rather than leaving blank , unsightly patches
have had no care for eighty years
gas jets below and leaky windows above , enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium , they have survived , in a building long unheated in winter , hot and damp under the iron dome in summer
I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me
well be that , when Rudy Pozzatti and I visited your country last spring , you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked
artists , it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as possible
might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful
we did not see many of your faces , it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard , from those whom we had the fortune to encounter , that we had been in your midst
very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R.
well understand your curiosity
ourselves , are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live
my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists
be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter
I endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes
of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert on anything I saw
damage is done by `` experts '' who have spent even less time , if any at all , in the U.S.S.R.
consider it reasonable , because of my commitment as an artist , to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific geo-political interests
attitude is seriously questioned in the Soviet Union , it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view
a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority , such as artists , in any social order
many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union about my reactions to that experience
I found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction
if I were talking about something quite unreal
is not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively , or at least dispassionately , to individual impressions of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments
tend to blunt the ear and , in turn , the voice as well
be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue
equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder , shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long ; ; the aggressive disbelief of those who are romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word `` Revolution '' ; ; the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical horizons
it may have been at times , Pozzatti and I saw enough , talked to enough artists , historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear
poets are the raw nerve-ends of humanity ; ; they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in everyday life
they may not be able to save the life on this planet , but without them there would be very little left worth saving
be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one
cold , but bright , April day we were guests of your government in the reviewing stand of Red Square to witness the poeple's celebration for Yuri Gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces of the Kremlin
thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement , our last day , to us at least , was equally impressive and very moving , even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence
under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of Moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor
, about half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church , rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green , the sounds of birds , the silence of other graves and the casual paths through small forests
we had met and talked with a living writer , a contemporary of the dead poet , who is known for his ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously
we were aware of only two men
taken a flight into uncharted space , in the service of science , to return as a living hero
had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit
on his grave attested to the fact that he as well was somebody's hero
recollections form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which , to me at least , symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and humanism
that is being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest
opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity
environment , it was stated , had cross-fertilized these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit
speculated on one such occasion that the new growth , like other mutations , might be unable to propagate , I was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice
not bring myself to answer that `` some of my best friends are non-propagating mules ''
of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to
while we were perhaps less surprised , but still puzzled , when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and illogical comparisons
remark about Lenin's sealed train brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to George Washington's cherry tree
the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern of gaseous masses
that Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence , namely , Cultural Exchange
such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union of Soviet Artists
looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of Moscow's artists
we became involved in a series of friendly , but overly formal , welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind
of friendship , understanding , cooperation , etc. , tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use
only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion
female functionary , of massive proportions and forbidding appearance , initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing the arts
only after we had responded , with what I fear were similar cliches , that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and Laos
by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there
returned later , just as I had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange Program would be the re-emergence of Abstract Art in Russia , with Social Realism regaining dominance in the U.S.
her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture her on Abstraction
not go so far as to say , as was done on other occasions , that Abstraction as well as Impressionism were a Russian invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the U.S.S.R.
I could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in Moscow than elsewhere
to discover , in fact , that quite a number of people share with us the impression that , in contrast to other Soviet regions , Moscow's atmosphere is depressingly subdued and official
one's intentions deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste of time
Moscow experience , I had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally
do not talk to each other in that fashion ; ; and , furthermore , I could not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a group
time , some clarification seemed necessary
is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in Leningrad : `` We have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your ways
here should also be considered further , sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer , peaceful ties among all people
quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between individuals
of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you , we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit
acutely aware that yours is a society which , in spite of several wars and many privations , has developed itself into one of the foremost nations of the world
history is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect
history is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements
come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours
, as American artists , believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity , we would be less than honest with you , or ourselves , if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole
this position , we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect
matter of fact , we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other American artists
, all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for similarities between you and us , but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding
, we have pride and love for our country
of us , this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignified freedom
we feel the same obligation , as do other individuals , in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation
Society is an ambitious work
is as broad as the question : What does it mean to live in modern society
so broad , even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision , must necessarily `` fail ''
hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots , errors of fact and argument , important exclusions , areas of ignorance and prejudice , undue emphases on trivia , examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence , and the like
are easy prey for critics
the critic be captious
and orderly man , who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility , might easily be put off by such a book
a simple matter , for one so disposed , to take a work like The Sane Society and shred it into odds and ends
can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large and vigorous family -- a motley jumble of discarded objects , some outworn and some that were never useful , some once whole and bright but now chipped and tarnished , some odd pieces whose history no one remembers , here and there a gem , everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human condition -- the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users
be easily done , but there is little reason in it
come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush , and that , after all , is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset
these features of the book because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must be mentioned
be superfluous to build a critique around them
more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account of capitalist civilization
worthwhile to recall that Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects
have already discussed his moral position , that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages , which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment
first indicate a couple of weaknesses in Fromm's analysis , then argue that , granted these weaknesses , he still has much left that is valuable , and , finally , raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation
empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation
rather long intellectual history , alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory
has received much attention in philosophy , in literature , and in a few works of general social criticism , such as The Sane Society
missing is work that would answer , presumably by the use of survey methods and Guttman-type attitude scales , such questions as these : What are the components of the feeling-state described as alienation
is alienation
its incidence among the various classes and subgroups of the population
as a dependent variable , with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated
an independent variable , how does it affect behavior in various sectors of life
work is done , there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual , who , rejected by and in turn rejecting the larger society , projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen
not suggesting that Fromm ought to do this kind of work
I think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual
saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence comes in , any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations
evidence appears , we must make do with the evidence we have
perhaps , Fromm is vulnerable , for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available , and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather special ways
follow
of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the bureaucratization of the corporation , the separation of ownership from control , and the broad ( and thus from the point of view of corporate control , ineffective ) dispersion of stock ownership
these points he relies exclusively on Berle and Means's study of 1932 , The Modern Corporation And Private Property
conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed , but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support , has suggested important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference , and has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area
unaware of these developments
is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topics : he cites such survey-type findings just three times
the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible
, he cites the following data from two studies on job satisfaction : in the first study , 85 per cent of professionals and executives , 64 per cent of white collar people , and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs ; ; in the second study , the percentages were 86 for professionals , 74 for managerial persons , 42 for commercial employees , 56 for skilled workers , and 48 for semi-skilled workers
that these data show a `` remarkably high '' percentage of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers
other value premises than Fromm's , some analysts might conclude that the percentages really tell us very little at all , while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low
, for example , once said that America was a paradise -- the only one in the history of the world -- for workingmen and small children
is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible , it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied
cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in 1945 , in which 49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work , while 41 per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount
these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread
one way to read the findings , but again there are other ways
use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory , an interpretation which would run counter to Fromm's theory of alienation
he might remind Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low : after all , the medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount ; ; and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view
of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of survey-type findings on public opinion , and considering the criticisms which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical anthropology , such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously
people happy , are they as satisfied , unconsciously , as they believe themselves to be
nature of man , and the conditions for happiness , this can hardly be so ''
suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought
to use the term alienation in two different ways
uses it as a subjective , descriptive term , and sometimes as an objective , diagnostic one
, sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery , and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent
to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader
permits Fromm to do some dubious things with empirical findings
is used as an objective and diagnostic category , for example , it becomes clear that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward conquering it
, in effect , does say this in his discussion of the pseudo-happiness of the automaton conformist
from this , and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society , it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread , stated worker satisfaction , rather than widespread , stated worker dissatisfaction
is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious motivations , and which rests on certain ethical absolutes , empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment
in the example cited above Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being deprived unconsciously , unknowingly , of fulfillment , and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious , experienced frustrations
his cake and eats it too : if the workers say they are dissatisfied , this shows conscious alienation ; ; if they say they are satisfied , this shows unconscious alienation
of manipulation is especially troublesome in Fromm's work because , although his system is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions , he asserts that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own consulting room
`` empirical psychoanalytic '' label which Fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy , it does increase the marketability of his product
example of the failure to use available evidence , though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered , comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same themes
brief chapter dealing with `` Various Other Diagnoses '' , he quotes isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to corroborate his own , and finds it `` most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth
finds it equally `` remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the twentieth century ''
nothing remarkable about this at all
largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes
a difference between evidence and illustration , and Fromm's citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category
the list : Burckhardt , Tolstoy , Proudhon , Thoreau , London , Marx , Tawney , Mayo , Durkheim , Tannenbaum , Mumford , A. R. Heron , Huxley , Schweitzer , and Einstein
a delightfully motley collection
make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear
of selection Fromm uses achieves exactly that
the list is interesting for its omissions
, for example , practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English social critics , nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious , and all those who are with more or less accuracy called Existentialists
, the list also excludes all writers who are fairly `` optimistic '' about the modern situation ; ; these , almost by definition , are spokesmen for an alienated ideology
not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion
these problems of the use of evidence , one meets another type of difficulty in Fromm's analysis , which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms
instance has already been presented : his use of alienation
other one I shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism
, capitalism is the enemy , the root of all evil
of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one's social criticism , for it makes diagnosis and prescription much easier than they might otherwise be
characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov , it is the consistency with which every person on the stage -- including the chorus -- comes alive in the music
this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections
he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera ; ; such composers as Monteverdi , Lully and Purcell , with the same goal in mind , had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages
experimentation in his songs , Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself
of his musical continuity to the orchestra , he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence , but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words
of sung melody , in the usual sense , come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing , as in folk songs and liturgical chants
reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion -- Boris' first monologue , for example
, the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance
Boris himself , one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture
who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities , defined with economical precision
four monks who figure prominently in the action : Pimen , Varlaam , Missail and the Jesuit Rangoni
circumstances could we mistake one for the other ; ; each musical setting has an individual touch
an old man , weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full forte -- but firm and clear of mind
offers contrast to Grigori's youthful excitement
but sturdy theme , somewhat folklike in character , appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life : This theme comes to represent the outer world , the realm of battles and banquets -- seen from a distance , quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery
and develops according to the text ; ; it introduces Pimen when he comes before Boris in the last act
has been identified , however , a new melody is used to accompany his narrative , a bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient effect : An imaginative storyteller , Pimen takes on the character he describes , as if he were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure
composer uses a favorite device of his , the intensification of the mood through key relationships
D minor seems to symbolize blindness , inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it
child addresses the shepherd in a dream , light -- in the form of the major mode -- begins to appear , and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining D major
Missail always appear together and often sing together , in a straightforward , rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated Pimen
song might easily be a folk melody : The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene
origin is humble , their approach to life direct and unsophisticated
they may have had in their order doesn't disturb them now
the straight man , not very talkative , mild-mannered when he does speak
loud , rowdy , uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same
ostinato figure , heard first in the introduction to the inn scene , characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action : The Song Of Kazan , in which this figure becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment , fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits
is irregular , and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness
can imagine how they startled audiences of the 1870's
music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine , but he pulls himself together when the need arises
respond to the guard's challenge with a few phrases of their begging song ; ; a clever naturalistic touch is Varlaam's labored reading of the warrant
knack gradually comes back to him , his rhythm becomes steadier , with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader
only time in the opera , words are not set according to their natural inflection ; ; to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene
dramatically , Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as Varlaam
shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with Dappertutto in Offenbach's Hoffman
shows none of the native accent of the Russian characters ; ; in spite of the Italian name , he sounds French
appears more striking by contrast with Marina , who is -- perhaps purposely -- rather superficially characterized
entrance is a musical shock , a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it
is as if he had materialized out of nowhere
quietly , concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility , just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them
Marina with great deference , calling her `` Princess '' at first ; ; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name , placing himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father
this scene is a close parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time , the scene between Amonasro and Aida
Amonasro have the same purpose -- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country's cause -- and their tactics are much the same
by describing the sad state of the Church ; ; this brings a reaction of distress from Marina
becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood : it is she , he tells her , who can bring the truth to Russia and convert the heretics
in a trance , she repeats his words -- then realizes , with a shock , her own audacity
no assignment for a frivolous girl , she assures him
comes to the point , and we hear , for the first time , a long , downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power
a phrase as arresting as a magician's gesture , with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness
, sinuously chromatic , appears as he directs her to gain power over Grigori by any means , even at the cost of her honor
a priest , the music sounds as odd as the advice : Marina rebels at this suggestion
is as much at stake as her virtue ; ; she is the unattainable beauty , the princess who turns away suitors by the dozen
denounces Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her
the Jesuit pulls out all the stops
of a menacing darkness , he describes the powers of Satan gaining control of the girl , poisoning her soul with pride and destroying her beauty
threat of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her , and she falls terrified at his feet
sudden change of mood , he is again calm and protective , exhorting her to trust and obey him as God's spokesman -- and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction
source of Rangoni's power , Marina is his captive now ; ; we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene , when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love duet , again throwing a chill over the atmosphere
unusual feature of Boris , however , is the use of the greatest character of all , the chorus
the real protagonist of the drama ; ; the conflict is not Boris versus Grigori or Shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child , but Boris versus the Russian people
this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action
entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the Coronation Scene , with its dazzling confusion of tonalities
a brief glimpse of the Tsar's public personality , the `` official Boris '' , but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd -- a significant contrast with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene , its bitter resentment and fury in the final act
for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression
speaks as a unit
its most conventional appearance , the guests' song of praise to Marina , there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness
passages -- for example , the council of boyars -- each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion
arise between tenors and basses , who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea
scene shows this method at its most individual
a telling picture of the common people , those who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without understanding the causes
held in control by force , but barely
kneel and plead for Boris' leadership in a strangely intense song , its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath , but when the police with their cudgels move away , they mock and grumble and fight among themselves
a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone
, Mityukh '' , asks one group , `` what are we shouting about ''
, apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd , replies that he has no notion
and arguments grow louder until the police return ; ; then the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before , ending it with a wail of despair
uses liturgical music with considerable dramatic force
cell the soft prayers of the monks , heard from offstage , not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young Grigori's thoughts and his situation
especially striking between Pimen's quiet exit and Grigori's vehement outburst against Boris
as Boris feels himself nearing death , a procession files into the hall singing a hymn , its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere : The words are hardly calculated to put the Tsar's mind at ease
the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who `` trembles and begs for mercy -- and there is no mercy ''
as well as the dead now accuse him ; ; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal one
the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the St. Basil's scene , usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score
, it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy
, it is an important link in the plot , giving us a revealing glimpse of the people's attitude toward Boris and the false Dimitri
in the forest of Kromy is a natural sequel
Basil's scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the square , the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny
orchestra we hear first a hushed , hesitant pizzicato figure , then the insistent `` police '' motif as it appeared in the opening scene
is over , and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman Mityukh in the lead
the news that the Pretender has been excommunicated ; ; this is met with scorn by the hearers , who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk
cleverly contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment , solemn chords or mocking staccatos
is still more news , Mityukh announces : they have prayed for the soul of the Tsarevich
these remarks , like most criticisms of Hardy , have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece , one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development
, Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period , but simply of Hardy , as of a poetic monolith
odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet : `` Domicilium '' is dated `` between 1857 and 1860 '' ; ; `` Seeing The Moon Rise '' is dated August , 1927
expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years , some changes in style and method would have occurred , some development taken place
not , however , the case , and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy only in a very limited sense
time when poetic style , and poetic belief as well , seem in a state of continual flux , Hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency
struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ; the `` sober opinion '' of his letter to Noyes , written when Hardy was eighty years old , is essentially that of his first `` philosophical '' notebook entry , made when he was twenty-five : `` The world does not despise us : it only neglects us '' ( Early Life , p. 63 )
in his later years he revised his poems many times , the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty ; ; so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one
only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his
only one Hardy style , but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident , and when it is not , the style is the style of another poet , or of the fashion of the time
later poems , however , the personal tone predominates
early poems are bad Shakespeare or bad Swinburne ; ; the bad late poems are bad Hardy
two ways of getting at a poet's development : through his dated poems , and through the revisions which he made in later editions of his work
quarter of Hardy's poems carry an appended date line , usually the year of completion , but sometimes inclusive years ( `` 1908 - 1910 '' ) or two separate dates when Hardy worked on the poem ( `` 1905 and 1926 '' ) or an approximate date ( `` During the War '' )
are virtually the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems , since the separate volumes are neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other
exception of Satires Of Circumstance , each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades ( Winter Words spans sixty-one years ) ; ; the internal organization rarely has any chronological order , except in obvious groups like the `` Poems of Pilgrimage '' , the `` Poems of 1912 - 13 '' , and the war poems
dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry , always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative
poems suggest that while Hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant , his production was not
two productive periods , one in the late 1860's , the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 ( half of the dated poems are from the latter period , and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy's poems )
one sterile period : only one poem is dated between 1872 and 1882 and , except for the poems written on the trip to Italy in 1887 , very few from 1882 to 1890
poems also give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past productions for his various volumes , and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time
The Past And The Present and Time's Laughing Stocks , both published while Hardy was at work on The Dynasts , draw heavily on poems written before 1900
Circumstance and Moments Of Vision , coming during his most productive decade , are relatively self-contained ; ; the former contains no poem dated before 1909 - 10 -- that is , no poem from a period covered by a previous volume -- and the latter has only a few such
three volumes are again more dependent on the past , as Hardy's creative powers declined in his old age
about Hardy's productivity tally with the details of his life as we know them
productive period came when he was considering poetry as a vocation , before he had decided to write fiction for a living ( in his note for Who's Who he wrote that he `` wrote verses 1865 - 1868 ; ; gave up verse for prose , 1868 - 70 ; ; but resumed it later '' )
poetically sterile years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was , in addition , burdened with bad health ( he spent six months in bed in 1881 , too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at A Laodicean )
in The Early Life support the assumption that during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry
records that `` at the end of November ( 1881 ) he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible '' ( Early Life , p. 188 ) ; ; and on Christmas Day , 1890 , Hardy wrote : `` While thinking of resuming ' the viewless Wings Of Poesy before dawn this morning , new horizons seemed to open , and worrying pettinesses to disappear '' ( Early Life , p. 302 )
more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's -- Hardy had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume of his fiction -- but none in 1891 , the year of Tess , and only one in 1895 , the year of Jude
the number increases , and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated poem -- 1903 , when Hardy was at work on The Dynasts
productive period , the decade from 1910 to 1920 , can be related to three events : the completion of The Dynasts in 1909 , which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years ; ; the death of Emma Hardy in 1912 , which had a profound emotional effect on Hardy for which he found release in poetry ; ; and the First World War
seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in his seventies , but we have it on Hardy's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen , a youth till he was five-and-twenty , and a young man till he was nearly fifty '' ( Early Life , p. 42 )
carry this sequence one step further and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers , wanting only the impetus of two tragedies , one personal , the other national , to loose those powers in poetry
productive decades were separated by forty years , yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself -- it was a narrowing , not an expanding process
wise gardener , Hardy pruned away the Shakespearian sonnets and songs , and the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style was not suited , and let the main stock of his talent flourish
of the later poetry is considerably narrower , but the number of successful poems is far greater
see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities : `` Revulsion '' ( 1866 ) and `` Neutral Tones '' ( 1867 )
not much to be said for `` Revulsion ''
half of the 1860 - 70 poems , it is a sonnet on a conventional theme -- the unhappiness of love
could have written it ; ; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form , but it is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike Hardy
is the conventional language of the form ; ; there is no phrase or image that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality to the poem
smoother than Hardy usually is , but with the smoothness of anonymity
obviously a young man's poem , written out of books and not out of experience ; ; it asserts emotion without evoking it -- that is to say , it is sentimental
many such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems
Tones '' we immediately recognize as a fine poem in Hardy's most characteristic style : the plain but not quite colloquial language , the hard , particular , colorless images , the slightly odd stanza-form , the dramatic handling of the occasion , the refusal to resolve the issue -- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems
does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic sources of diction , yet it is obviously not ordinary speech -- only Hardy would say `` a grin of bitterness swept thereby ; ; like an ominous bird a-wing '' , or `` wrings with wrong '' , or would describe a winter sun as `` God-curst ''
of the setting of `` Neutral Tones '' are not , strictly speaking , metaphorical , but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love , and in this way love and weather , the emotions and the elements , symbolize each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's best poems ( `` Weathers '' , `` The Darkling Thrush '' , and `` During Wind and Rain '' , for example ) and to some moving passages in the novels as well ( Far From The Madding Crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way )
Tones '' is an excellent example of Hardy's mature style , drawn from his earliest productive period ; ; I cite it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older ( as Yeats did ) , but that he simply learned to use better what he already had
poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world ; ; if it is somber , it is also precise , and the precision lends authority to the vision
Revulsion '' , on the other hand , the pessimism is a case not proven ; ; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's right to speak as he does
1860 - 70 decade there are many poems like `` Revulsion '' , but there is only one `` Neutral Tones ''
not Hardy very often
Poems of 1912 - 13 '' offer a good example of Hardy's style as it was manifested in the later productive decade
the poems Hardy wrote after the death of his first wife ; ; they compose a painful elegy to what might have been , to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness , and ended in long years of suffering and hatred
felt that these poems were peculiarly personal and private ; ; he sometimes called them `` an expiation '' , and he would not allow them to be published in periodicals
the only poems that he rearranged as a group between their first appearance ( in Satires Of Circumstance ) and the publication of the Collected Poems
tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice , and it is not surprising that the 1912 - 13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his
is always toward the past ; ; but the mood is not quite nostalgic -- Hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable pastness of the past , and the eternal deadness of the dead
are , the epigraph tells us , the `` traces of an ancient flame '' ; ; the fire of love is dead , and Hardy stands , as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence , over the burnt circle of charred sticks , and thinks of past happiness and present grief , honest and uncomforted
, modern revolt , like X-rays and radioactivity , is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels , where it is called delinquency
'' , by the way , is the term used by the critic and poet , Lawrence Lipton , who has written several articles on this subject , the first of which , in The Nation , quoted as Epigraph : `` We disaffiliate
John L. Lewis
pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas
word deliberate means anything , both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves
them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves , because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art
them were my friends
San Francisco I saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue
the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration
time I saw Bird , at Jimbo's Bob City , he was so gone -- so blind to the world -- that he literally sat down on me before he realized I was there
happened , man ''
, referring to the pretentious `` Jazz Concert ''
, man , evil '' , he said , and that's all he said for the rest of the night
he got up to blow
crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it
time I saw Dylan , his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality
assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter
him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones
Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end
, they were very similar
both very fluent
fluent , enchanting utterance had , compared with important artists of the past , relatively little content
them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity
theme of Thomas's poetry was the ambivalence of birth and death -- the pain of blood-stained creation
of course , is not so explicit an art , but anybody who knew Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift
them did communicate one central theme : Against the ruin of the world , there is only one defense -- the creative act
of course , is the theme of much art -- perhaps most poetry
the theme of Horace , who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to Parker or Thomas
is that Horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken assurance
and Bird it was an agony and terror
not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity
rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value
of imperishable verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome
have been for him the most enduring , orderly , and noble activity of man
other activities of his life partook of these values
not actively negate them
verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews
able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas ovens
world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven , I believe his art became meaningless to him
all this could apply to Parker just as well , although , because of the nature of music , it is not demonstrable -- at least not conclusively
Parker have more in common than theme , attitude , life pattern
practice of their art , there is an obvious technical resemblance
popular belief , they were not great technical innovators
are only superficially startling
a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire
the innovations of bop , and of Parker particularly , have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music , especially by that ignoramus , the intellectual jitterbug , the jazz aficionado
novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries
is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz , no matter how progressive , and Dixieland , than there is between two movements of many conventional symphonies
and his contemporaries -- Gillespie , Davis , Monk , Roach ( Tristano is an anomaly ) , etc. -- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation of the older jazz into the basic structure , of which it then became an integral part , and with which it then developed
true of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- Benny Carter , Johnny Hodges
true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously , or at least is continuously sprung , so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe
exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music
the difference between Bach and Mozart
not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry
syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith Sitwell -- actually ornaments -- become the main concern
conceits , which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still dominant in backwater American colleges , were embroideries
and ambiguities are ends in themselves
theme , if it exists , is incidental , and his main theme -- the terror of birth -- is simply reiterated
one difference between Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out
contrary to popular belief , there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either musically or emotionally
melody is a sort of naive transcendence of all experience
does not resemble Berlioz or Wagner ; ; it resembles Mozart
true also of a painter like Jackson Pollock
have been eccentric in his behavior , but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles
difference is due to the nature of verbal communication
talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry
much more a personal difference
wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world
Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world
and simple , rendition , is not of major importance , but it is interesting that Parker , following Lester Young , was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution
jazz , the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional embouchure
Thomas's verse was extremely conventional , as was , incidentally , the verse of that other tragic enrage , Hart Crane
to make clear what I consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts
confabulation in the interstices of structure
by Dylan Thomas , a saxophone solo by Charles Parker , a painting by Jackson Pollock -- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves
come to determine structure
should be distinguished from its exact opposite -- the sterile , extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals , or present blight of poetic professors
Hart Crane had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers -- like Allen Tate , for instance , to whom Valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities of an Apollinaire , let alone a Paul Eluard were nonsense -- so Dylan Thomas's influence has been slight indeed
, his only disciple -- the only person to imitate his style -- was W. S. Graham , who seems to have imitated him without much understanding , and who has since moved on to other methods
influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now extinct British romantic school of the New Apocalypse -- Henry Treece , J. F. Hendry , and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets
had much more of an influence
time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in America to blow like Bird
his death this influence had begun to ebb
, the whole generation of the founding fathers of bop -- Gillespie , Monk , Davis , Blakey , and the rest -- are just now at a considerable discount
line of development today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them
is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant , idiosyncratic
no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to Eluard , or for that matter , from Hawthorne through Henry James to Gertrude Stein
generation before World War 1 , , and , on a lower level , the surrealists of the period between the wars , both assumed an accepted universe of discourse , in which , to quote Andre Breton , it was possible to make definite advances , exactly as in the sciences
if anyone holds such ideas today
, but like the neo-swing music developed from Lester Young , it is a continuity sustained by popular demand
plastic arts , a very similar situation exists
Hans Arp and Max Ernst might talk of creation by hazard -- of composing pictures by walking on them with painted soles , or by tossing bits of paper up in the air
is obvious that they were self-deluded
anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or Arp
less like their work than the happenings of random occasion
the post-World War 2 , abstract expressionists , apostles of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard , look alike , and do look like accidents
appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist , but it is a very impoverished appeal
what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals , the accidents of painting
curious that at its best , the work of this school of painting -- Mark Rothko , Jackson Pollock , Clyfford Still , Robert Motherwell , Willem De-Kooning , and the rest -- resembles nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters : the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a Henry McFee , itself a formula derived from Renoir ; ; the splashes of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of Hals and Sargent
of this sort is presented as calligraphy -- the pure utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values
only to compare such painting with the work of , say , Sesshu , to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly
best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo decorative surface
shows up immediately when compared with Tiepolo , where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity and power
painting , however confabulated , is a universe of tensions in vast depths
is an object of art -- bijouterie -- disguised only by its great size
, once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall , it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper
is nothing wrong with complicated wallpaper
just more to Tiepolo
Ashikaga brush painters painted wallpapers , too -- at least portable ones , screens
of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long
in the last couple of years , abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures
Greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age
bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg ( lines 1068 - 1159 ) , and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund ( lines 871 - 892 ) ; ; Alcinous' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of Ares and Aphrodite ( Odyssey 8 266-366 ) , and takes up a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on ( Odyssey 8 499-520 )
all this is autobiographical : unlike the poets of Deor and Widsith , the poet of Beowulf is not concerned with his own identity ; ; the poet of The Odyssey , reputed blind , reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel Demodocus
of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter , there is prima-facie evidence that Beowulf and the Homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition
a tradition lies behind The Iliad and The Odyssey , at least , is hard to deny
rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric poems are largely formulaic , and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived ; ; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas
Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata , Francis P. Magoun , Jr. , argues that Beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations , and the thesis is striking and compelling
fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment : Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent
endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very skilful oral poet , but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty , even in a language of many terminal inflections
nearly as severe a curb , although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings
alliterative line and the Homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint ; ; the verse of Beowulf or of The Iliad and The Odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents perforce in earning a livelihood
aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause
in a written tradition who generally never blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame
oral poet cannot pause ; ; he must improvise continuously with no apparent effort
the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition
poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of alliteration ; ; the Homeric poet had epithets , which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter
could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines , because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns
could of course serve the same function , and for the sake of ease I shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest possible sense , and name , for example , Gar-Dene a kenning for the Danes
adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction , but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents , and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language
a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon as in the other Germanic dialects , we cannot say how frequently the kennings in Beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same soil
can say that since a writing poet , with leisure before him , would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution , the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition
the greatest Homerists of our time , Frederick M. Combellack , argues that when it is assumed The Iliad and The Odyssey are oral poems , the postulated single redactor called Homer cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of phrasing
of grand or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow-craftsmen
of the historical Homer is likely never to have further success ; ; no individual word in The Iliad or The Odyssey can be credited to any one man ; ; no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before Christ
is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well
extent that a tale is twice told , its final author must be suspect , although plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi
further , and here he makes his main point , that once The Iliad and The Odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry , Homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they previously found arable
few important and a few more unimportant exceptions , no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context , because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow
phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers , sometimes accurate and sometimes not
too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry
extent that a language is formulaic , its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches
Bryan suggests that certain kennings in Beowulf were selected sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness , but such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language of Beowulf is formulaic
master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional , he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements
significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity , they are not to be defended for their semantic properties in isolated contexts
false to be certain of having discovered in the language of Beowulf such effects as intentional irony
if the argument is turned awry , there may be found a great deal in Bryan's view , after all
element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection
though the periphrastic expressions are , they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous
evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things , and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate
we do not know how they were regarded in their day , but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases
adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce ; ; in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus , and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation
therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem ; ; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam
at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift ship in Greek
defenseless of weapons the Danes would be Gar-Dene ( as their king is Hrothgar ) and Priam would be EUMMELIHS
like Siegfried in The Nibelungenlied , is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly be called swift-footed even when he stands idle
the agnomen of Marcius is used deliberately and pointedly , but the Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the hearer `` a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent ''
language was not entirely the servant of the poet ; ; it was partly his master
intentions are difficult to discern and , except to biographers , unimportant ; ; the language , however , is a proper object of scrutiny , and the effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable
the Homeric poems appear oral compositions
are written ; ; at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed
Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were dictated to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his guild , and Magoun argues that the Beowulf poet and Cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion
is attractive , but is vitiated at least in part by the observation that Cynewulf , though he used kennings in the traditional manner , was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes into his works
was literate , the Beowulf poet may have been also , and so may the final redactor of The Iliad and The Odyssey
of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard , one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry recited , and became intimately familiar with the established aids to poetizing , and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past
of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory : Beowulf may contain a design for terror , and The Iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in pottery
of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests partly , however , upon the degree to which they were formulaic
Schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated exactly in the two Homeric poems , and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted 2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times
line in five from The Iliad and The Odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems
is thoroughly remarkable , because the lines are so long -- half again as long as those of Beowulf
appears to have no comparable amount of repetition ; ; there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric colleague
the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle , however , to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety , for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs
scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric epithets ; ; if any words or phrases are formulaic , they will be
has two words for the shield , ASPIS and SAKOS
of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M. D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor ''
Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective
analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative
seeks to make that exploration
not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers
instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response
hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands
Expectations the hands become almost an obsession
habitually bites his forefinger , a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates , half terrifies all who have dealings with him
withered hands , heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them , move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick
signature '' is the perpetually extended glad hand
his self-satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hands together
Pocket's frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless , social-climbing wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair '' and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it '' , whereas Joe Gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs. Joe by apologetically drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose ''
would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of Dickens' novels , hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them
only reveals character through gesture , he makes hands a crucial element of the plot , a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters , and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt , pursuit , crime , greed , education , materialism , enslavement ( by both people and institutions ) , friendship , romantic love , forgiveness , and redemption
only to think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer in Thomas Burke's famous story , `` The Hands Of Mr. Ottermole '' , to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment
is with Great Expectations , whether the hands be Orlick's as he strikes down Mrs. Gargery or Pip's as he steals a pie from her pantry
suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of Dickens' novel , but , on a deeper plane , they relate to the themes of sin , guilt , and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics
opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard `` as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people , stretching up cautiously out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in ''
Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a bogy man who may `` softly creep his way to him and tear him open '' , `` imbruing his hands '' in him
agonizes over the theft that his own hands have committed , his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost , transforming it into `` a phantom devoting me to the Hulks ''
down in the graveyard , Pip clings in terror `` with both hands '' to his convict ; ; later he flees in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to Gargery's forge for mending
details Dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between Pip and Magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter both their lives
commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds , hands naturally represent action , and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it , the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at
for excellent psychological reasons , never fully reveals Magwitch's felonious past , but Pip , at the convict's climactic reappearance in London , shrinks from clasping a hand which he fears `` might be stained with blood ''
about the forge `` like Cain '' with `` his hands in his pockets '' , and when he shouts abuse at Mrs. Joe for objecting to his holiday , she claps her hands in a tantrum , beats them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees '' , and clenches them in her husband's hair
`` rampage '' is only the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head , `` dealt by some unknown hand '' whose identity is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action -- the tracing of Orlick's hammer upon a slate
is to feel the terror of Orlick's `` murderous hand '' in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marshes
great emphasis on the hands in this scene
his hand at Pip , bangs the table with his fist , draws his unclenched hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth watered '' for his victim , lets his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides '' , and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers ''
almost be Magwitch's bogy man come alive , a figure of nemesis from Pip's phantasy of guilt
, disfigured wrists of Mr. Jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister past , for her master , coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests , makes a point of the `` force of grip there is in these hands ''
control over her ( `` she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , hesitatingly , as if she dreaded his calling her back ) '' ) rests on his having once got her acquitted of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails
the similarity between Estella's hands and Molly's ( `` The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting '' ) that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of Satis House
Magwitch's pursuit of Compeyson , his archenemy and betrayer , begins by his holding him in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates in his `` laying his hand on his cloak to identify him '' , thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which Compeyson drowns
here ironically becomes the agent of justice
in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , revenge , and retribution
so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens , is here central , and hands are often associated in some way with the false values -- acquisitiveness , snobbery , self-interest , hypocrisy , toadyism , irresponsibility , injustice -- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth
the economic evils of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers `` who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle '' , who seemed to have `` all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets , and had never taken them out in this state of existence ''
expectations , his progress through illusion and disillusionment , turn , somewhat as they do for the naive hero of Dreiser's American Tragedy , upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income -- what Wemmick calls `` portable property '' and what Jaggers reproaches Pip for letting `` slip through ( his ) fingers ''
gentleman must , if possible , avoid sullying them by work , his hands , as importantly as his accent , become the index of social status
first step in the corruption of Pip's values is the unworthy shame he feels when Estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands : `` They had never troubled me before , but they troubled me now , as vulgar appendages ''
how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands , roughened by work in the smithy , and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work , artificiality and naturalness , gentility and commonness , coldness and affection -- in fact , between Satis House and the forge
snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your blackened hand ''
leave-taking of Miss Havisham , during which he kneels to kiss her hand , signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour ; ; when , on the journey to London that immediately follows , he pauses nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village , the wooden pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity
one cannot miss the significance of this gesture , for Dickens reintroduces it associatively in Pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis -- his painful recognition , in a talk with Herbert Pocket , that his hopeless attachment to Estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic
cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms
of hand movements helps dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond the forge
attendance of the Pocket family upon Miss Havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of Miss Camilla Pocket , who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of grief-stricken choking , then lays it `` upon her heaving bosom '' with `` an unnatural fortitude of manner '' , and finally kisses it to Miss Havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward Estella
throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement
see him shaking Mrs. Joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for Pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping Pip's hands `` for the hundredth time at least '' ( `` May I -- may I -- ''
effusive congratulation to Pip on his expectations
leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip's loss of fortune , extending his hand `` with a magnificently forgiving air '' and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers '' , one of which he identifies with `` the finger of Providence '' and shakes at Pip in a canting imputation of the latter's `` ingratitoode '' and his own generosity as Pip's `` earliest benefactor ''
learns `` the stupendous power of money '' from the sycophantic tailor , Mr. Trabb , whose brutality to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource of each new customer , and whose fawning hands touch `` the outside of each elbow '' and `` rub '' Pip out of the shop
which money confers implies a different etiquette , and , upon taking up the life of a London gentleman , Pip must learn from Herbert Pocket that `` the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under ''

or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an EQU statement , e.g. , When the index words or electronic switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements described above , the position or order of the statements within the program is not important ; ; any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass
assignment pass of Phase 3 , , index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment
and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways
two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches ; ; the third applies only to index words

assignment pass , each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch
a reference is found , an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment

one- or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an XRESERVE or SRESERVE statement ( see page 99 ) , the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved

statement has been assigned an address in the index word area by means of an actual label or by means of an origin statement which refers to an actual address , the corresponding index word will be reserved
should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each LITORIGIN statement
symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words
method does not apply to electronic switches
preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized or multi-phase program , particularly when used in conjunction with the LITORIGIN statement
should be used , however , to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address
symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an XRELEASE or SRELEASE statement ( see page 101 ) , the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available , regardless of the method by which it was reserved
not , however , be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time
at any time during the assignment pass , the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment , the warning message `` No More Index Words Available '' will be placed in the object program listing , the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through 96 are available , and the assignment will continue as before
compiler finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment , the warning message `` No More Electronic Switches Available '' will be placed in the object program listing , the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available , and assignment will continue as before
conflicting usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used , e.g. , through the proper use of the EQU , XRELEASE , or SRELEASE statements
in Appendix C , index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment to symbolic names by the compiler ; ; also , index words 93 through 96 may have been made unavailable for assignment

Midwest , oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas
cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume
Fayette , Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg/l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb
indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations , the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds
by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer
showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr. / hp.
Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes
that a 4-day retention , aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent BOD reduction
Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months
from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume
Subdivision With the development of the Red Bridge Subdivision south of Kansas City , Missouri , the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal
system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years
the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 Aj
initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1
pond has a surface area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 Aj
is currently serving 1,230 persons or 260 persons per acre
summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors
possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae
conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate
same time further expansion in the Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities
land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer
proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development
The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage
plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom , 4 ft below the surface , with a volume of 121,000 Aj
slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion
lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area
contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed
lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period
the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period
would permit evaluation of the pilot plant , with a slowly increasing load , over a reasonable period of time
plant was equipped with a 3-hp. turbine aerator ( Figure 2 )
had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds
flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24-hr. charts
sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents
was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River through a surface drainage ditch
samples were collected at weekly intervals
retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent
would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples
samples were normally collected over a 6-hr. period , but an occasional 24-hr. composite was made
the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6-hr. composite samples with 24-hr. operations
indicated that the organic load during the 6-hr. composites was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr. organic load
were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions
made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-hr. composite sample
24-hr. composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical
operations The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mg/l with an average of 350 Aj
equivalent to 240 mg/lBOD on a 24-hr. basis
of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision
in the effluent averaged 58 mg/l , a 76-per-cent reduction over the 24-hr. period
the data in Table 1 , shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent Aj
of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted
the aerator to overload , straining the drive belts
of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage
loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of BOD/day or about 2 lb BOD/day/1,000 cu ft aeration capacity
say , the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis , but was 270 lb BOD/day/acre on a surface loading basis
that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system
rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1
spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers
progresses , the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced
period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days , averaging 6.4 days
amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem
were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface
device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids
volatile suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mg/l while MLSS averaged 170 mg/l volatile suspended solids
sludge age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be 14.5 days
uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 mg/l/hr during the first four months of this study
aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand
in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2 to 2.6 mg/l/hr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds
that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active microbial solids with the heavier , less active solids settling out
solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the Aj
the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mg/l Aj
in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 Aj
BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study
Routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by McKinney and Gram for the various types of protozoa
found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation pond
time were algae found in the mixed liquor
formed typical activated sludge floc
particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out
the flagellated protozoa predominated , but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa
temperature decreased , the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased
protozoa activity existed below 40-degrees-F
temperature reached 32-degrees-F all protozoan activity ceased ; ; but as the temperature rose , the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly
were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor
of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population
One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator
were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates
given in Table 2 , show the routine operation of the aerator
oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961
cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water
resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity
approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected , but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen
of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate
the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover
of oxygen transfer at 1.0-mg. / l. dissolved oxygen concentration and 10-degrees-C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3
rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 mg/l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lb/day at a maximum rate of 9.3 Aj
power requirements indicated 2 lb. oxygen transfer / hr. / hp.
cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface
During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted
this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium nitrate
of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer
concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mg/l of BOD with an average of 230 Aj
data are given in Table 4
24-hr. composite sample had a BOD of 260 mg/l , indicating a typical domestic sewage
sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147,000 gpd , giving a retention period of 42 days
loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb. BOD / day / acre
BOD averaged 34 mg/l , a little lower than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of 60 lb. Aj
of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg. / l.
of the effluent showed that minimum BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather
algae began to build up again , the effluent BOD rose
two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent BOD's in the effluent were 18 and 16 Aj
the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping , defense of naval forces , and area defense
category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases
these operations , five elements exist ( 1 ) surface , ( 2 ) air , ( 3 ) mines , ( 4 ) submarine , and ( 5 ) fixed installations
have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations , air to furnish area surveillance , and mines for protection of limited areas
shore installations are new elements
now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas
offer possibilities for area detection
is being reoriented against submarine targets
element , not always considered , is intelligence
operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment
presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies ; ; intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augmented program in oceanography
postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting
an over-all concept Thinking on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut
single elements tend to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified , and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents has assumed the greatest importance
air , surface , and submarine elements overshadow the mine , fixed installations , and intelligence
sought more and more of what they have
to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others
despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting
the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed
stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense , one which would provide positions of relative importance to ASW elements based on projected potentialities
enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective
concept would have other advantages
allow presentation to the public of a unified approach
problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily
element is announcing progress , another is delineating its problems
can only be confusion in the public mind
concept can serve as a guide to budgeting and , if public support is gained , will command Congressional support
criticism of the Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how
, industry picks its own areas
, coupled with the salesmanship for which American industry is famous , is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas
concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest dividends
a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for co-ordination of the Navy's efforts , for a logical presentation to the public , for industry's guidance , and as a basis for a program to the Congress
in an over-all concept That which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare
the preponderance of submarines in the world , divided between her various fleets
also in Albania and others are on loan to Egypt
which may willingly or unwillingly become Communist can furnish bases
areas can be assumed , but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with Soviet intentions
come from almost any direction against many locations
then , the first principle of the plan must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area
often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building , at bases , in transit , and on station
the enemy's building and base complex , however , requires attacks on enemy territory , which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities
or on station , it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act
are adept at utilizing hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage
second principle of the plan must be that , while providing for all-out hostilities , its effectiveness is not dependent on general war
does not involve clashes between large opposing forces , with the decision a result of a single battle
a war of attrition , of single actions , of an exchange of losses
must result in our ending up with some effective units
having fewer units of some elements -- especially submarines -- than the opponent , our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs , so that the exchange will be in our favor
the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types , unless at an assured favorable exchange rate
has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since World War 2
has increased , it operates at increasingly greater depths , its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited , and it will become even more silent
developments will probably be in weaponry
can gradually be expected to replace the torpedo
ranges increase , weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges
the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent
can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense
support the others , but all have limitations
of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another
in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements
the plan's fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of all elements in combination
submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces
be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution
aircraft procurement , and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything
any measures taken in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur
the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements
is constantly changing ; ; what was new yesterday is obsolescent today
principle of the plan is self-evident ; ; it must be flexible enough to allow for technological breakthroughs , scientific progress , and changes in world conditions
in asw operations To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated , the mission has been stated , broad principles delineating its content laid down , and the supporting elements listed
these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated
coverage will accomplish all other tasks
because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required , the plan should provide for expanding area coverage
must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically
the system giving area coverage ( if such coverage is less than world wide ) must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile
area coverage appears fairly remote , the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements : air , surface , sub-surface , fixed installations , mines , and intelligence
arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result
as used herein , will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations
be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence
defense these must have maximum stress
intelligence can ensure sound planning , greatly reduce force requirements , and increase tactical effectiveness
is just as important
presently co-operates with the target
of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side , resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics , a decrease in enemy capabilities , and the development of methods of capitalizing on the environment
improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and , as it supports all other elements , rates a top priority
is important , but of equal importance is its translation into usable form
is needed to translate the results of oceanographic research into tactical and operating instructions
problem on a statistical basis is invalid , because the opponent has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions , but under the conditions most advantageous to him
the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions , in the area , at the time of encounter
must be used to maximum advantage then
wind , oxygen content , depth , bottom character , and animal life are the chief environmental variables
be others
sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature , because more of the variables would be encompassed
must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically
predicting water conditions is encouraging , but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information
effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot
has in the past been directed against surface targets
nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater counter-efforts
being increasingly oriented against submarine targets
still considered to be for use in restricted waters , however , and targets must come within a few yards of them
to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment , extended to deep water , and have their effective area per unit increased
be used to deny access to great areas ; ; they are difficult to counter , cost little to maintain until required , and can be put into place quickly
attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package
will reduce force requirements
, effective mine barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the Yucatan Channel from Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense , inshore patrol , convoy escort , shipping control , and mine defense for the entire Gulf of Mexico
systems , covering all passage into the Caribbean , would free the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico from the previously listed requirements
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the United States are not impossible
defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase in the probability of success
inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any of the other elements
are increasingly advocated as the problem of area defense emerges
are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts
detect submarines over wide areas are attractive , although they can be only `` burglar alarms ''
are required to localize and attack detected targets , since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target
are expensive and are oriented geographically
over-all ASW concept , dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with proven capabilities
installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined
, proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile system
will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems
has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system
in its target's environment , and any advantage gained therefrom by the target is shared by the attacker
submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed
( 1 , and 2 ) ) of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from Aj
carbons of PABA are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 ( ( as shown with both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled Af )
the 36 carbon atoms arise from Aj
carbons of metabolite 1 ( ( a product of mild acid hydrolysis of 2 ) arise from Aj
, isolated from the medium , however , showed a lower specific activity , which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite
hydrolysis of metabolite 1 , destroyed the biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines
has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt and free base
tentatively indicates that the molecule ( metabolite 1 ) ) is cleaved at a secondary amide bond
H. Sloane ; ; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation of K.G. Untch
on esterases -- Research on esterases in mammalian sera was continued
the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to rare earth ions
of the enzyme by very low concentrations of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect of rare earth salts
ions have been found to protect plasma arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine
can be related to the structure of this enzyme
of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established
the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian sera , and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin ( or a factor attached to it ) in addition to arylesterase
can distinguish the two activities
the acceleration of human plasma cholinesterase were carried further
G. Erdos , L. E. Boggs , C. D. Mackey ) biophysical studies on modified fibrous proteins -- Electron-microscopical and physical-chemical methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured collagen and ribonucleic acid
V. Rice ) A method was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen ( EWC )
observed that EWC macromolecules are the same diameter ( 15 a. ) but much longer ( up to several microns ) than vertebrate tropocollagen
collagen also was shown to undergo a reversible thermal phase transformation
V. Rice , M. D. Maser ) studies on peptides and peptidases -- This investigation involved several aspects
, an active urinary peptide , was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated column chromatography ; ; high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography were used in preliminary structural studies ; ; pharmacological effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in vivo on blood pressure were assayed ; ; special equipment required for registering respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles under various conditions was developed by the Instruments Section ( Victor Jackman , W. C. Barnes , J. F. Reiss ) ; ; and enzymes which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps Substance Z were studied
in progress to develop ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions
G. Erdos , C. D. Mackey , A. G. Renfrew , W. B. Severs , E. M. Sloane ) seed proteins -- In a physiochemical study of seed proteins , the globulins of the Brazil nut have been investigated
to the known principal globulin , excelsin , three other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed
protein of quite low molecular weight ( ca. 10,000 ) has also been found in this system and partly characterized
F. Casassa , H. J. Notarius ) continuum mechanics and viscoelasticity theory of non-newtonian fluids -- On the basis of a differentiability assumption in function space , it is possible to prove that , for materials having the property that the stress is given by a functional of the history of the deformation gradients , the classical theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation has been infinitesimal for all times in the past
the differentiability assumption , it has been possible to derive second and higher order theories of viscoelasticity
second-order theory , one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the first-order stress relaxation function
D. Coleman with Walter Noll , Department of Mathematics , Carnegie Institute of Technology ) viscoelastic measurements -- An extensive series of measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation , free vibration , and creep measurements over the temperature range of Af to 80-degrees-C
as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally
time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous systems did not hold here
possible , however , to decompose the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two viscoelastic mechanisms , each compatible with the Boltzmann superposition principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence factors
Markovitz , D.J. Plazek , Haruo Nakayasu ) geochemistry trace elements in tektites , meteorites , and related materials -- The results of microanalysis of tektites ( natural glasses of unknown origin ) for gallium and germanium have shown that these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial ( or less likely from lunar ) matter by impact of a celestial body
/ germanium ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous , metamorphic , or sedimentary matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components of the tektite
is less volatile than silica ( the main constituent of tektites ) and germanium oxide is more volatile
tektites from Australia ) give the appearance of a second melting
with this conclusion a higher trace gallium content was found in the portion ( flange ) that has undergone a second melting
fractions of stony meteorites show gallium / germanium ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone melting at some point in their histories
silica-glass , another natural glass , is composed of nearly pure silica and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area
content , however , has been enhanced five-fold
is probably formed from Libyan Desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite impact
with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large terrestrial explosion craters may nevertheless melt only small quantities of material
the impact energy is spent in crushing and fragmentation
quenching follows melting , impact glasses may result
contain metallic inclusions
not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been produced by stony meteorites or comets
have ever been recovered from paleoexplosion craters , and recent craters containing impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception of Aouelloul crater , Adrar , Western Sahara Desert
contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic material has been recovered
J. Cohen , John Anania ) inorganic chemistry Preparation of a coordination compound is often accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol
this general principle , a great number of complex compounds of osmium , ruthenium , iridium , and rhenium , with triphenylphosphine , triphenylarsine , and triphenylstibine have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years
Vaska , E. M. Sloane , J. W. DiLuzio ) In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary , decomposition of solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were not considered , following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in preparative coordination chemistry
with radiocarbon and deuterated alcohols as solvents , however , has given evidence that metal-hydrido and carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction with alcohol in some of these systems
the previously reported compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and carbonyl compounds discovered , the more representative examples being Af , Af , Af , Af and Af ( Af )
complexes formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and arsines are being investigated ( R. G. Hayter )
is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes
past year , these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes of nickel ( 2 ) and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged complexes of palladium ( 2 ) ( see figure ) , as well as new compounds of the well-known type Af
, properties , and reactions of these compounds are being studied
study chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species , prepared homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis , are being characterized and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed under varying preparative conditions
A. Laswick , N. L. Heatwole ) structure and properties of macromolecules elasticity of macromolecular networks -- The theory of elasticity of Gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the equations of state relating variables of pressure , volume , temperature , stress and strain have been precisely formulated
has been treated in detail
stress-temperature coefficients for constancy of volume and strain , constancy of pressure and strain , and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated
accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy of compressibility have been related to the elongation
of these theoretical studies , a more precise elucidation of the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought
J. Flory , C. A. J. Hoeve ) chain conformations of polymeric chains -- Recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions of polymeric chains by Volkenstein and Lifson has been extended to include more general types of chains
end-to-end distance of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with values deduced from viscosity data
are being extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the hindrances to rotation around chain bonds
A. J. Hoeve , A. A. Blumberg ) crystallization in polymers and copolymers -- The crystallization of copolymers comprising Af units interspersed with a minor percentage of Af is limited by the inability of the crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky side group of the latter
sequences of the former are eligible for formation of crystallites
the lengths of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short crystallites which can be formed , and this is reflected in a broadening of the melting range
Chiang , J. B. Jackson , P. J. Flory ) Carefully executed melting studies on this system ( M. J. Richardson ) permit quantitative estimation of the instability engendered by reduced crystallite length
morphology of polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor
the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations in the latter field
muscle -- Glycerinated muscle , in the presence of the physiological agent ( ATP ) responsible for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins of muscle , has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of alcohols and water
out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees Centigrade and to a concentration range of only several per cent
therefore partakes of the character of a phase transition
appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction , its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction
A. J. Hoeve , P. J. Flory ) anionic Polymerization -- One of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight distribution
process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed
of such products is not new , but the systems heretofore employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high purity
new process impurities present in the solvent ( benzene ) , the monomer , and in the reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers , are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of initiator , a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium , at a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth
of the purging step , additional initiator appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added , and the system is then warmed to the polymerization temperature , at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion
of the molecular weights was found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared , with Af ratios less than 1.1
observations with ethers , no apparent change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable periods of time in benzene as solvent

classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing
objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter , to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects , and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption
years , the preservation of food was essentially related to survival
more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations , food-preservation techniques have sought also to bring variety , peak freshness , and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer
development of nuclear technology , isotopic materials , and machine radiation sources in recent years , the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout the world
hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled
, however , in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing , or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations
for the spoilage of foods The chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are ( 1 ) microorganisms such as bacteria , molds , and yeasts , ( 2 ) enzymes , ( 3 ) insects , ( 4 ) sprouting , and ( 5 ) chemical reactions
often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods
concern is the growth of bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum which generate poisonous products
in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability
chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment , as in corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity
a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes , onions , carrots , beets , and similar root vegetables
is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain
of parasitic organisms such as Trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which must be dealt with in food processing
the storage of food for long periods of time , a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic action
`` sterilization '' applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms
in this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration
of `` pasteurization '' involves milder and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction of most , but not all , of the microorganisms
thermal treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes
of ionizing radiation Ionizing radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or , at lower doses , can inhibit their action
a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic organisms present in meats
enzymes is also possible , although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 Mrad or more
undesirable flavors , odors , colors , and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude , the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching
not retard the chemical spoilage of food
, however , inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables
doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following ranges : 1
, to destroy all organisms for long-term preservation -- about 4.5 Mrad for nonacid foods of low salt content

, to partially destroy microorganisms ; ; results vary with types of food , storage conditions , and objectives of treatment -- commonly of the order of 0.2 Mrads but up to about 0.8 Aj

of insects -- about 25,000 Aj

the sprouting of root vegetables -- 4,000 to 10,000 Aj
with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects , particularly at the higher radiation dosages
respect , the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has , to date , been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods
of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and palatability , however , at dosages substantially less than sterilization levels
the nutritive value of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little , if any , change , although some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization doses
For irradiation of food , the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation , and X-ray , gamma , and high-energy electron radiation are suitable
availability and economic considerations , each has certain practical advantages ; ; for example , gamma rays give deeper penetration but cannot be focused or collimated , whereas unidirectional electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiated
a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate , load factor , throughput , convenience , safety , and most important , costs
potentially useful sources of ionizing radiations , gamma sources , cobalt-60 , cesium-137 , fission products , or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems
various particle accelerators , the Van De Graff machines , resonant transformers , and linear accelerators are the principal ones available for commercial use
the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation processes
costs of radiation energy from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per Aj
for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per kwhr for process steam
therefore , is at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization or radiosterilization
the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the future
been estimated that for applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for gamma radiation generated in a reactor core
reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen
, however , appear highly speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond those foreseen for food-preservation facilities
activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered geographically , and because of the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location , the use of large central processing stations , where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt range might be utilized , is inherently impracticable
of irradiation preservation of foods The objective of complete sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time
in radiosterilization resides in the military services
, providing appetizing food under battle or emergency conditions is a paramount consideration
completely sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration , preferably items already cooked and ready to eat
value , variety , palatability , and appetizing appearance are important for reasons of morale
rear stations , which require cooking , but no refrigeration , are also of interest
interest are meats
which produces fewer adverse sensory changes in food products , has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items
food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability
is chiefly in this type of treatment , as is military interest under peacetime conditions
status of food preservation by ionizing radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs
radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation
, the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is pork
interest to the military services is the demonstration that roast pork , after radiosterilization , is superior in palatability to available canned pork products
beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development of off-flavors
objective of the Army Quartermaster Corps program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means of overcoming it , since it is a major and desirable dietary item
low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes before radiosterilization , treated fresh meats have the appearance of boiled or canned meat
a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats , but problems of commercial acceptability remain
doses of from 100,000 to 200,000 rads can extend the shelf life ( at 35 F ) of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks
the problem of consumer acceptability remains
blanching process discolors the treated beef and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts
irradiated in the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color
and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses , the meat becomes dehydrated , the fat becomes chalky , and , again , unnatural changes in color occur
such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration , and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities
a major problem here is one of scale of processing ; ; ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local level , whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities
of color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid cuts
items containing meat portions , as in `` frozen dinners '' might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization
potential advantage would be that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen
item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type
for preserving meats are by canning and freezing
canning meat are in the range of 0.8 to 5 cents per pound ; ; costs of freezing are in the area of 2 to 3.5 cents per pound
on page 10 shows costs of canning and freezing meat , and estimated costs for irradiation under certain assumed conditions
conditions of comparison , it will be noted that : ( 1 ) Radiosterilization ( at 3 Mrad ) is more expensive than canning , particularly for the cesium-137 source
) Radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137 source is in the range of freezing costs
) Irradiation using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator
of irradiation tests with poultry have been quite successful
doses , good palatability results , with a minimum of changes in appearance , taste , and odor
also been successful , and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared with about 10 days for the untreated product
and odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken
radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed , however , for two reasons : ( 1 ) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation and distributing practices , and ( 2 ) treatment by antibiotics , a measure already approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration , serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.5 cents per pound
seafood products are extremely perishable
has served to extend the storage life of these products , substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately
it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible
is shown in Fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard , sharp , tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating
required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal
removal force is a function of coating thickness , a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness
too , is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut
of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals , glass , wood , and plastic surfaces
of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out
have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests
method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time
wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle , a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating
thicknesses a cutting ( or shearing ) phenomenon is often encountered
coating becomes thicker , the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure
coating becomes still thicker , a peeling type failure finally can occur
appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 , which are single frame enlargements of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process
be seen from Fig. 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating
forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface
of Figs. 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at , or close to , the interface between coating and substrate
force required to remove the coatings is plotted against film thickness , a graph as illustrated schematically in Fig. 5 may characteristically result
H is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and T is the film thickness
be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal
it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response , while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature
be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness
interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case
, are the factors that contribute to these phenomena
the `` practical adhesion '' of a coating as assessed by a knife method change , initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness
of cohesive failure The cutting ( or shearing ) removal process has been previously described
found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure
of the removal process are shown schematically in Fig. 6
forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane , which makes an angle **yf with the substrate
and reaction forces are R and Af , respectively , and are equal and opposite in direction
other force vectors are derived from these
the force required to cut a coating of thickness T from the substrate
the shear force along the shear plane ; ; Af and Af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife , respectively ; ; Af is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane ; ; Af is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces , and P is the normal force acting on the face of the knife
the rake angle of the knife ; ; **yf is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate ; ; **yt is the friction angle ; ; and **yb is the angle the resultants make with the plane of the substrate
of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle **yc and the friction angle **yt determine the vector direction Af of the force resultants R and Af
both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process
difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of R directly
practice , the values most readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force Af and the shear angle Aj
values and the rake angle **yc are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships
defined by the geometry of the knife ; ; **yf can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate ; ; Af is instrumentally determined
6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is Af where **yl is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material , W is the width of the removed coating and T is its thickness
cutting force , Af , is plotted against film thickness , a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope Af
in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn. ( 1 )
One of these is the fact that the knife employed , no matter how well sharpened , will have a slightly rounded cutting edge
that **yc , the rake angle , is no longer a constant to zero film thickness
of this bluntness is , in the case of the Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer , determined by the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mil.
vector concept of Fig. 6 can readily be applied to this condition also
rake angle Af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller ( or even negative ) when compared to the value of **yc for the major portion of the knife , a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result
to the relationship : Af , where Af is the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn. ( 1 ) , Af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife tip , Af is a straight line first approximation of this roundness , and the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn. ( 1 )
be seen that Af is a constant , and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife
the knife , the higher is the value of Af
of a hard , abrasion-resistant knife material like the Carboloy employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes apparent
would blunt very rapidly , making the value of Af inexact
cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a measurement
A second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate
not a constant value like Af , but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the resultants R and Af of Fig. 6
conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust Af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of Af
friction force , Af is thus directly proportional to Af and consequently also to film thickness
of Af can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings
line relationship is usually observed in a plot of Af against load L , having slope k , and Af
load L , under actual cutting conditions is caused by Af , it can be seen that Af
force , H , in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating , Af , that due to the bluntness of the knife , Af , and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate , Af , or Af
two forces are directly interrelated and depend upon film thickness , whereas Af is independent of these two and is a constant for a given knife/coating combination
relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig. 7 and their sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig. 5 for the cutting mechanism
of cohesive failure Although a large number of coatings systems , particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism , frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place
a chipping , dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle coatings resins or very highly pigmented films
shown in the photomicrograph of Fig. 8
difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture , rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane
mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied extensively by Merchant for metal cutting , and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings
high speed movies made of this type of failure , the sequence of relationships as schematically illustrated in Fig. 9 could be observed
first picture ( 9a ) the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation
next , the shear plane angle is high , and extends to the inclined work surface
advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases
rupture occurs along the shear plane ( 9e ) , and the cycle repeats itself
found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used
if the shear angle **yf is replaced by the rupture angle Af , the relationships as described in eqns. ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) will directly apply
mechanism Under equilibrium cutting conditions , the chip exerts a force Af against the coating and an equal opposite force Af against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig. 6
rake angle **yc of the knife is high enough and the friction angle **yt between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for Af , the resultant vector R will lie above the plane of the substrate
a few years , foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral , and important , phase of the plastics industry -- and the end is still not yet in sight
, as only one example , was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955
year's volume probably topped 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb. by 1964
the other foamed plastics , particularly the styrenes , show similar growth potential
are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated
issue goes to press , for example , one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength ; ; another reports that a cellular polypropylene , primarily for use in wire coating applications , is being investigated
following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing
be well to point out , however , some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved
foams , for example , there has been a definite trend toward the polyether-type materials ( which are now available in two-component rigid foam systems ) and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding
also seem to be concentrating on formulating fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets
as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention
outstanding example , Whirlpool Corp. found that by switching to urethane foam insulation , they could increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models
has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams , including spraying , frothing , and molding ( see article , p. 391 for details )
meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment interlining , new adhesives and new methods of laminating foam to a substrate have been developed
for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost that particular material into a number of new consumer applications , including picnic chests , beverage coolers , flower pots , and flotation-type swimming toys
end-use areas which contributed to expandable styrene's growth during the year were packaging ( molded inserts replacing complicated cardboard units ) and foamed-core building panels
styrene film or sheet -- claimed to be competitive price-wise with paper -- also showed much potential , particularly for packaging
for building utility shelters that consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused interest in the construction field
foam , the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material ( for details , see P. 395 )
hand '' , a more luxurious feel , and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result
also saw possibilities in using the technique for extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent
in additional information on foams are referred to the Foamed Plastics Chart appearing in the Technical Data section and to the list of references which appears below
Since the mid 1950s , when urethane foam first made its appearance in the American market , growth has been little short of fantastic
are that production topped the 100-million-lb. mark in 1960 ( 85 to 90 million lb. for flexible , 10 or 11 million lb. for rigid ) ; ; by 1965 , production may range from 200 to 350 million lb. for flexible and from 115 to 150 million lb. for rigid
that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations
, as just one example , can easily take millions of pounds ; ; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer ; ; and use of the foam for garment interlining is only now getting off the ground , with volume potential in the offing
Urethane foams are , basically , reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates ( usually tolylene diisocyanate )
be either one of two types -- carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon
important factor in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production
the main types used were various compositions of polyesters
still in wide use today , particularly in semi-rigid formulations , for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural panels , foamed-in-place insulation , automotive safety padding , arm rests , etc.
, polyethers -- again in varied compositions , molecular weights , and branching -- have come into use at first for the flexible foams , just lately for the rigids
glycols are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired in cushioning
first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method , today , thanks to new catalysts , they can be produced by a one-shot technique
possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours and with superior properties to latex foam
urethane foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters ; ; the polyether group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol or polypropylene glycol modified with a triol
vs. prepolymer In the prepolymer system , the isocyanate and resin are mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs
can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of catalyst in solution
, the isocyanate , polyester or polyether resin , catalyst , and other additives are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately
this means that simpler processing equipment ( the mixture has good flowing characteristics ) and less external heat ( the foaming reaction is exothermic and develops internal heat ) are required in one-shot foaming , although , at the same time , the problems of controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are critical ones
commercial uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lb. / cu. ft. for rigid foams , between 1 and 3 lb. / cu. ft. for flexible foams
figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average of 5.5 lb. / cu. ft. in commercial grades
: Graph in Fig. 1 , p. 392 , indicates how the ratio of compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased
curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example
the formula , this curve may be moved forward or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression strength / density ratio
and temperature resistance : In flexible urethane foams , we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials' primary performance remains functionally useful
resistance , this quality is usually related to specific properties , e.g. , flexural , tensile strengths , etc.
is directly traceable to the material's porous , air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which form its composition
or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers
factor , a term used to denote the rate of heat transmission through a material ( B.t.u./sq. ft. of material/hr./*0F./in. of thickness ) ranges from 0.24 to 0.28 for flexible urethane foams and from 0.12 to 0.16 for rigid urethane foams , depending upon the formulation , density , cell size , and nature of blowing agents used
, , p. 394 , shows a comparison of K factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials in common use , including two different types of rigid urethane foam
: This term refers to the ability of a material to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by bending
urethane semi-rigid foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance , i.e. , the 12 lb. / cu. ft. foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 3 lb. / cu. ft. density
flexural strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density , nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another
strength is an important factor , be sure that your urethane foam processor is aware of it
: This property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart
compression strength of urethane foams , it has a direct relationship to formulation
tensile strength is another of urethane foam's strong features
, above , shows the aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change in tensile strength during exposure to ultra-violet light
There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product
can be made into slab stock and cut to shape , it can be molded , it can be poured-in-place , it can be applied by spray guns , etc.
is still one of the most important forms of urethane end-product in use today
the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units , a variable mixer , a nozzle carriage assembly , and , in many cases , a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidifies into foam
are fed from tanks through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate
head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle
takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure , the material can be cut into lengths as desired
been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate the slab stock into finished products
machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce sine , triangle , trapezoid , and other profiles in variable heights , dimensions , etc.
sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically
is a slitter which `` peels '' the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd. in length , down to 1/16 in. thick
cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes , dimensions , and contours that can be tailor-made to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case liners , materials handling containers , packaging and cushioning devices , and such novelties as soap dishes , toys , head rests , arch supports , and gas pedal covers
slab stock appeared first , it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with irregular shapes , crowned contours , or rounded edges , the cutting of slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process
resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market
molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material ( molding in open molds was more feasible )
for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether foams were never fully achieved
generally resulted in parts weighing more ( because of higher density ) than parts fabricated from free-blown foams
the gain from having no scrap loss
, there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface , trouble with lack of gel strength in the rising foam , and problems of splits
of one-shot polyether foam systems , aided by the development of new catalysts , helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding
are still many bugs to be ironed out , the technique is fast developing
Simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured , pumped , etc. , into a void where they foam up to fill the void
typical application -- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels -- an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a jig
the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C )
rolls are loaded with 40 lbs.
loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate
box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe ( thus returning suds to soap box ) and the machine is started
bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen
continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls
conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-F ( 32*0C. ) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub
requires from 10 to 12 minutes
rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins
point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge
of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs
is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line
procedure rinsing progresses in two stages , first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water , since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste from the suds box drains
of rinsing appears to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition
and classification Evaluation may be made on either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired
instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning , whereas Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal

photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability
such situations are ( aerial ) night reconnaissance , the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues , special radiography in medical or industrial applications , track recording of high energy particles , etc.
image intensification may be achieved by several methods ; ; some of these are listed below : ( A ) Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems , ( B ) Channel-type , secondary emission image intensifier , ( C ) Image intensifier based upon the `` multipactor '' principle , ( D ) Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E ) Cascading of single stages , enclosed in one common envelope
stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely
intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values ; ; they suffer , however , from an inherently low resolution
based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned
the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain
have been constructed showing high gain and resolution
electrostatic focus , important for many applications , has not been realized for these devices
with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic aberrations
the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be tolerated
stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution
may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members
optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one
may be smaller , equal , or larger than unity
system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen ( or interstage coupler ) is utilized , while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the solenoid , which is heavy and bulky
will be discussed later , peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber couplers
be noted , however , that the paraxial resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems
felt that fiber-coupled double- ( and multi- ) stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance in the future
we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes
efficiency and resolution of single stages , fiber couplers , and finally of the composite tube will be computed
be shown theoretically that the high image intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits the utilization of extremely low incident light levels
of device and quantum noise , associated with such low input levels , will be described
theoretical considerations , constructional details of a fiber-coupled , double-stage X-ray image intensifier will be discussed
characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed
shall be reached that fiber-coupled , double-stage tubes represent a sensible and practical approach to high-gain image intensification
of a fiber-coupled , double-stage image intensifier The tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now
optical system ( see fig. 14-1 ) is based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode and anode surfaces
( anode ) sphere is pierced , elongated into a cup , and terminated by the phosphor screen
emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres , pass through the ( negative ) lens formed by the anode aperture , and impinge upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen
focusing electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential
potential codetermines the gain , G , and magnification , M , of the stage
photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved concave as seen from the anode aperture
property of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or coupling member
same reason , the output fiber plate is planoconcave , its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent record is desired
will be shown later , the field-flattening properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design
photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates
sensitivities S , phosphor efficiencies P , and anode potentials V of the individual stages shall be distinguished by means of subscripts 1 , and 2 , in the text , where required
are assumed to have unity magnification
of flux gain flux gain of a single stage The luminous gain of a single stage with Af ( flux gain ) is , to a first approximation , given by the product of the photocathode sensitivity S ( amp / lumen ) , the anode potential V ( volts ) , and the phosphor conversion efficiency P ( lumen/watt )
, P is a function of V and the current density , but it shall here be assumed as a constant
efficiency Af of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant sensitivity Af and on the spectral distribution of the incident light Af by the relation : Af where Af is normalized radiant photocathode sensitivity
standard visibility function
flux gain of a single stage is given by : Af
input light distribution falls beyond the visible range , Af as expected , since Af
are not considered here
fiber couplers The efficiency of fiber optics plates depends on four factors : ( A ) numerical aperture ( N.A. ) ; ; ( B ) end ( Fresnel reflection ) losses ( R ) ; ; ( C ) internal losses ( I.L. ) ; ; ( D ) packing efficiency ( F.R. )
aperture of the fibers is given by : Af where Af
Af is measured in the medium of index Af
, as generally used in image intensifiers , have low optical contact with the substrate surface , hence Af shall be assumed
aperture should be in general close to unity
can be satisfied , e.g. , with Af and Af or equivalent glass combinations
good approximation for determining the end reflection losses R can be obtained from the angle independent Fresnel formula : Af
to fiber and fiber to air surfaces , and assuming Af , we obtain Af percent
may be reduced to 4.6 percent by means of a ( very thin ) glass layer of index 1.5
the Af factor for the output fiber coupler is Af
index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the SbCs-type lies around 2 , the Fresnel losses at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the Af factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95
be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further
losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the prescribed , cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections of the core-jacket interface
depend on fiber diameter and length , absorption coefficient , the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last , but not least , on the angular distribution of the incident light
( integral averages ) are given in the literature
data for some of the variables , we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent internal losses for 1/4-inch long , small ( 5 - 10 M ) diameter fibers
high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal reflections
are considering here relatively small diameter ( 1 - 1.5 inches ) fiber plates , their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent ( per plate )
efficiency , F.R. , of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature , probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used , until rather recently
fibers in a closely packed hexagonal array , the packing efficiency is given by : Af where Af , and 0.906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribed hexagon
small diameter fibers now technically feasible and required for about 100 Af resolution , Af
thickness is about 0.5 M , hence , Af and Af
the efficiency **yt couplers is given by -- Af or approximately 50 percent each
be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a ( mica ) membrane , in addition to an optical output lens system
Af of an Af lens at the magnification Af is : Af
, the end losses of the coupling membrane and the output window Af would be 6 percent and 8 percent
the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates ( with a combined efficiency of 0.25 ) is 0.043 or about six times less than that of the two fiber plates
fiber coupled image intensifiers Including the brightness gain Af due to the Af area demagnification , the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is : Af
obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which maximizes Af for a given input E ( in the case of the second stage , for the first phosphor screen emission ) is very important
consideration should govern the choice of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate sensor ( e.g. , photographic emulsion )
evaluated the `` matching integrals '' for two types of photocathodes ( S-11 and S-20 ) and three types of light input
light distributions considered are P-11 and P-20 phosphor emission and the so-called `` night light '' ( N.L. ) as given by H.W. Babcock and J. J. Johnson
( in units ) are listed in table 14-1 , below
of paraxial device resolution resolution limitations in a single stage The resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen
capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations
been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity magnification
the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high voltage
, a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution
gain of the discussed tube was calculated from Eq. ( 6 ) for the 16 possible combinations of S-11 and S-20 photocathodes and P-11 and P-20 phosphor screens , for night light and P-20 light input
P-20 input is of interest because it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray fluorescent screens )
efficiencies obtained from JEDEC and RCA specifications were used : Af
table ( 14-2 ) lists the ( luminous ) gain values computed according to Eq. ( 6 ) with Af
of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has been pointed out
obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels
influences will also decrease at increased voltages
of the pseudo-symmetric type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography
of 70 - 80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible
resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness ( with increasing anode voltage ) , decreases with decreasing porosity ( thus the advantage of cathodophoretic phosphor deposition ) and might be impaired by the normally used aluminum mirror
in general , elementary light optical effects , light scatter , and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit
be noted that photoluminescence , due to `` Bremsstrahlung '' generated within the viewing screen by electron impact , appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess of 30 KV are utilized
been stated that settled cathodoluminescent phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 Af at high voltage values of approximately 20 Aj
further discussion , we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 Af and phosphor screen resolution of 60 Af
of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy
policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product
thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired
chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream
second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter
function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4
characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman
that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process
by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal Af-stage policy for the remaining stages , we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all R stages
this way , from one to two and from two to three stages , we may gradually build up the policy for any number
step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied
how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ; then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Af ( where a is some number not unreasonably large )
from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for interpolation ; ; this number will be of the order of Af
however , we are seeking the optimal R-stage policy for a given feed state , only one search for a maximum is required at the final step
number of operations of the order of Af are required
the operating variables were varied simultaneously , Af operations would be required to do the same job , and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program
more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages
, the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages
problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states , Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search
is vastly larger than R
is more baseless than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the crudest of methods in searching out a result
Af , and that the average operation requires only Af sec.
dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia
of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process
1957 ) has annunciated in the following terms : `` An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are , the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision ''
the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation
in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer
same time , every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value , and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end
discrete deterministic process Consider the process illustrated in Fig. 2.1 , consisting of R distinct stages
be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream , so that stage R is the T stage from the end
state of the stream leaving stage R be denoted by a vector Af and the operating variables of stage R by Af
denotes the state of the feed to the R-stage process , and Af the state of the product from the last stage
transforms the state Af of its feed to the state Af in a way that depends on the operating variables Af
this Af
is uniquely determined by Af and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic
situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions , and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set S
of vectors Af constitutes the operating policy or , more briefly , the policy , and a policy is admissible if all the Af belong to S
policy has been chosen , the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation ( 1 ) ; ; thus Af
function , which is to be maximized , is some function , usually piecewise continuous , of the product state
be denoted by Af
policy is an admissible policy Af which maximizes the objective function P
may not be unique but the maximum value of P certainly is , and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as a function of the feed state Af
where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af
is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af
choice of admissible policy Af in the first stage , the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by Af
the feed state of the subsequent Af stages which , according to the principle of optimality , must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to this state
result in a value Af of the objective function , and when Af is chosen correctly this will give Af , the maximum of the objective function
where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af , and Af is related to Af by ( 5 )
of equations ( 6 ) can be solved for Af when Af is known , and clearly Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af
of equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and the starting equation ( 7 ) is of a recursive type well suited to programming on the digital computer
the optimal R-stage policy from that of Af stages , only the function Af is needed
has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of Af and the whole calculation repeated
see how the results may be presented , although if n , the number of state variables , is large any tabulation will become cumbersome
or set of tables may be set out as in Table 2.1
the optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af , we enter section R of this table at the state Af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function
third column is given the optimal policy for stage R , and in the fourth , the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used
the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to Af , we may enter section Af of the table at this state Af and read off the optimal policy for stage Af and the resulting state Af
this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and , if it is desired , we can check on Af by evaluating Af at the last stage
be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af , as when the cost of the operating policy is considered
reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case
of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af
represents the value of the stream in state P and Q the cost of operating the stage with conditions Q
is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation , that is , the net profit
denotes the net profit from stage R and Af , then the principle of optimality gives Af
of equations may be started with the remark that with no process Af there is no profit , i.e. , Af
discrete stochastic process The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only statistically is also of interest , although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process
case the stage R operating with conditions Af transforms the state of the stream from Af to Af , but only the probability distribution of Af is known
specified by a distribution function Af such that the probability that Af lies in some region D of the stage space is Af
now speak of maximizing the value of the objective function , since this function is now known only in a probabilistic sense
, however , maximize its expected value
single stage we may define Af where the maximization is by choice of Af
have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given Af
consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next , then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first
, the maximization being over all admissible Af and the integration over the whole of stage space
of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here , except that now the fourth column is redundant
column gives the optimal policy , but we must wait to see the outcome of stage R and enter the preceding section of the table at this state
of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter
continuous deterministic process In many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages , since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process
r , the number of the stage from the end of the process , by t , a continuous variable which measures the `` distance '' of the point considered from the end of the process
distance is used here in a rather general sense ; ; it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process
is the total `` length '' of the process , its feed state may be denoted by a vector p(T) and the product state by p(Q)
the state at any point T and Q the vector of operating variables there
platform system , using restrained gyros , is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination
gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion , neglecting transient effects , as follows : Af where U is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro
angle **yf is the angle about which the gyro is controlling
normally termed the gyro input axis , 90-degrees away from the gyro output or **yj axis
angular momentum is defined by H
the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj
assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes
system shown in Fig. 7-1 , the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer
causes the entire system to rotate about the **yf axis , since the response to Af
polarities are correct , the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero
accelerometer output is decreasing , the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and , therefore , the rate decreases
when the accelerometer output is zero , the entire system remains stationary , and the platform is , by definition , leveled
block diagram for the leveling system is shown in Fig. 7-2
is initially off level by the angle Aj
generated by the platform servo **yf multiplied by G is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer
the scale factor of the accelerometer ( Af )
Af is amplified by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af
the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by Af
as indicated in Fig. 7-2 is fundamental and simple because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have been neglected
factors included , an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations
type of system , a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time
frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered , their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain
required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain
, the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain ; ; i.e. , high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations
usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time
be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration
relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af
, the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe
system is arranged for automatic leveling , the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers
many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts , engine noise , turbulence around the vehicle , etc.
the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise
to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters
causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt
lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time , a practical compromise must be reached
the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a non-linear amplifier for Af
is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level
level , the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value , in order to provide adequate noise filtering
is that the platform returns from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level , at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process
system is on automatic leveling , the gyro drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system ( amplifier Af )
actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer output , when amplified by Af , will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift
of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system

considerations
leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros
requires some switching of flight equipment circuits
the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform
system will hold the platform on-level , automatically , as long as the system is actuated
by-product of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level
process can be accomplished manually , and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment
consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero
is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above
, the human replaces amplifier Af in Figs. 7-1 and 7-2
requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs
accuracy is required in preflight leveling , it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs ( this also minimizes the noise problem )
, the effect of a small acceleration ( or small platform tilt angle ) can be seen after a time
skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy
it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach
is inconvenient if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time
must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled
is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random


consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator
terms , it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction
inertial navigators , two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading : Use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading ; ; Use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading
of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements , field conditions , and the time available to accomplish the heading

of heading -- surveying technique
gyro-stabilized platform leveled , it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques
accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure
accelerometers are mounted on the platform , the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined
is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit

transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north
be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques
transit set up , a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned
procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light , which is darkened by crossed hairs , on the accelerometer mirror
platform is aligned , the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed hairs
can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy
is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers
technique is simple and satisfactory , one practical difficulty does exist : the direction of true north must be known for each launch point
this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work
installations , the inertial platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight
situation , it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment
platform is not too high off the ground , a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform
the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand

can be replaced by an autocollimator
provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading
signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the Z-gyro torquer
polarity is correct , the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero
also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the Z-axis gyro
Z gyro is drifting , a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift
drift error is systematic , it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required compensating current

possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff , which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform
the stator or reference portion of the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction , and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero


is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading
case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros , a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the X accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction at the base point , and the Y accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point
are mounted rigidly on the platform
if one accelerometer is properly aligned , the other is also
axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers
shows a platform system with the gyro vectors arranged as described above
is leveled and properly headed , so that the X-gyro input axis is parallel to the east-west direction and the Y-gyro input axis is parallel to the north-south direction
axis of the X gyro , when pointing in the east-west direction , is always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth
platform is not properly headed , the X-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation
of this rotation by the X gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading
7-4 , the input axis of the three-axis platform is shown at some point on the earth
is at a latitude **yl , and the platform is at an error in heading east
is spinning at an angular velocity **zq equal to one revolution per 24 hr.
platform is level , **ye is a rotation about the Z axis of the platform Af
earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space , an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating ( with respect to the earth )
did not go back to school
talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the University Hospital -- Mr. McKinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family -- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off , spend a lot of time in bed and , for the rest , do pretty much as he chose -- provided , of course , he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating
and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home , there was little danger of his losing a term
the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments
discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus
a smart hat and , because she had been warned recently about smoking , puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick
sat sprawled in his chair , angular , alert as a cricket , looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship
men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles -- came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel
polite , Scotty indifferent
the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and Scotty gazed without interest at his food , the teachers , the heroic baronial windows , and the bright ranks of college banners
tried to make the food a topic

seizure , Scotty had had little appetite ; ; yet his changed appearance , surprisingly , was one of plumpness
was fuller ; ; his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking
now with his mouth open , showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth ; ; he kept his eyes , with their puffed blurred lids , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing
neck seemed thicker and , therefore , shorter
, which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds , were now neither active nor really relaxed
on his lap , palms up , stiffly motionless , the tapered fingers a little thick at the joints
had , since the seizure , the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise
lazy , spoiled , a little querulous
little to say
her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness , offering nothing
, for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity , was completely alert to his son , eyes always on the still face , jumping to anticipate Scotty's desires
a strained , silent lunch
, `` I'd better get him to bed ''
had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger
McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth
not speak much
out at ugly gray slums and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids ''
a Negro section of peeling row houses , store-front churches and ragged children
to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat
, `` Nothing ''
: `` There are lots of kids around here ''
at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull
tired and full and calm
days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each day , almost the same
late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel
him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuits , cookies , candies -- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen
hover over him and , looking like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty's fork or spoon

observing , would say , `` He has to rediscover his own capacity

Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere
Scotty constantly , Rachel without seeming to , Virginia openly , her eyes filled with concern
neutral
not resent their supervision or Virginia's sometimes tiring sympathy
what he felt like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms of the house , when he was not in bed , with slow , dubious steps , like an elderly tourist in a cathedral
was gone
able , now , to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving
lay loosely , yet stiffly -- they were like wax hands : almost lifelike , not quite -- folded in his lap ; ; his mouth hung slightly open
was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable , he would answer ; ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder
not mentioned Kate
not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly , almost accidentally , encounter her
times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest , but it was an objective pain , in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind ; ; it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed ; ; it was merely another part of his weakness
calm , drugged , and lazy
not care
Kate
, `` I notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit ''
, `` That's all right
right ''
about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk to something else
sitting at the front window in his parents' room , he saw Kate come out of her house
with Elizabeth
far off and looked tiny
branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them
at the bottom of Kate's steps and moved off in the direction of the park
he saw -- it awakened and , for a moment , interested him -- that Elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash
disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed
time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing Kate
, since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him , came often and informally to the house
sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge of Scotty's bed , his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor
not mind the doctor's unsmiling teasing as he used to
young man '' , he said with mock distaste
imagine you're always battling in school ''
don't go to school any more ''
''
had to bend close to hear ; ; his delicate hand , as veined as a moth's wing , rested absently on Scotty's chest
the same words more loudly

unsmilingly to Rachel

the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed
, `` Okay ''
Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead
pleased
was a constant visitor
hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow voice ; ; it floated up the stairs
Scotty ''
or Virginia's reply : `` better
plenty of rest ''
his appetite improved ''
`` Does he get exercise ''
was almost invariable , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it
smiled
an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father
would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son
pause , during which he studied Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs
reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat

`` I walk around the house a lot ''

were new men and to be sure that they didn't get lost , Prevot had placed Warren and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out
now fixed on White's solid figure , Warren could hear behind him the tread of another
also hear the stream which he had seen from his position
going to follow it for part of their journey
safe '' , Prevot had said , `` and it provides cover for our noise ''
were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night
right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees
branch extended out too far , each man held it back for the next , and if they met a low overhang , each warned the other
stealthily they advanced upstream ; ; then they turned to the right , climbed the embankment , and walked into the valley again
no cover here , only grass sighing against pant-legs
each sigh , like a whip in the hand of an expert , the grass stripped something from Warren
whir of each footstep left him more naked than before , until he felt his unprotected flesh tremble , chilled by each new sound
of the men ahead of him lacked solidity , as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh
forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage , their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords
, broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes
brush that they passed were so many enchained demons straining in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones
all , Papa-san leered down at him , threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies
the distance a searchlight flashed on , its beam slashing the sky
ray was absorbed by a cloud , then reflected to the earth in a softer , diffused radiance
there another patrol had need of light
of all the men out that night who , like himself , had left their protective ridge and -- fear working at their guts -- picked their way into the area beyond
east to the west coast of the Korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night , sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound , or shouting amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts
went up and Warren raised his own
was stopping
up ``
spot over there '' , he whispered , pointing to a small clump of blackness
me your machine gun ammo ''
him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line
the grass behind the brush clump , Warren looked about
likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush
shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun crew
this short distance they were only vague shapes , setting up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol
his rifle's safety off and gently , slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an Aj
placed within quick reach
and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air
armored vest fitted the upper part of his body snugly , he felt no security
to crouch in the surrounding dark ; ; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched
menace was only imaginary , he yet stared in fascinated horror , his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon
aware of insistent inner beatings , as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body
the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds , diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light
figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees , standing like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene
, he could not ease the tension of his body ; ; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax
unseen presence of the other men in the patrol , he felt mutely united to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him
something precious in the perilous moment , something akin to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside , a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness
France he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger to their exultation
poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning -- enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there
that stone-gray mystery through which he traveled for thirty days , sleeping in the barns of farmers or alongside roads , had worked some subtle change in him , he knew , and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre
no hands ; ; they had been severed at the wrists
cups fitted in his handlebars , he steered his bicycle
Warren had traveled together for four days
the shipyards at Brest and Pierre had to sign the register , vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner
the pen in his stumps and began to write


guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside
the small room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book
formidable '' , they exclaimed
, oui
''
the questions came , eager , interested questions , and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity
it ever bother you '' , Warren had asked , `` to have people always asking you about your hands ''
, the French are a very curious people '' , Pierre had laughed
are also honest seekers after truth
English are painfully silent about my missing hands
to mention or to notice that they are not there
, like yourself , take the fact for granted , try to be helpful , but don't ask questions
to all three , but I think the French have the healthiest attitude ''
the day that Pierre had told Warren about the Abbey of Solesmes
are looking tired and there you can rest
be good for you
, too '' , he said , his dark eyes mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken ''
weeks Warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate
who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception : `` I speak English '' , the old man said , `` but I do not hear it very well ''
and stuck a large finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that might help
Warren's protestations , the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor
you please wait in here
over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue
Cafe was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent of beer , tobacco smoke , and Italian cooking

when it comes to war , the Colonel knows what it is and Jeff doesn't
knows that a soldier will get the Distinguished Service Medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian
a mean , unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit , and someone invented the name Trig for him
say , he was trigger happy
at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry
a wiry , inscrutable , silent country boy from the red clay of rural Alabama , and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally make fun of
in front of Trig
of some that tried it back in the States , and he'd knock them clear across the room
a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base
York kid , a refugee from one of the Harlem gangs , made fun of Trig's accent , and drew a knife
fight was over , the Harlem boy had a concussion and Trig was cut up badly
Trig stealing liquor from the officers' mess , and he got a couple of girls in trouble

was Mrs. Dalloway
how this dainty , fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of Westminster on a day in June , enjoying the flowers in the shops , the greetings from old friends , but never really drawing a deep , passionate breath , was so like himself

waiting for Bill Boxell
President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home
the matter was urgent
was uneasy about the visit
not like Boxell
something underhanded and furtive about him
not put his finger on it precisely , and this worried him
disliked or distrusted a man , you should have a reason
was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell
a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic , hoping that a clue to his dislike of the Vice President would appear
not
he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view
hour later the Vice President arrived
very carefully at every piece of furnishing , as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind
the Florentine vase in the hall , the Renoir painting in the library , as well as the long shelves of well-bound volumes ; ; the pattern of the Oriental rug , the delicate cut-glass chandelier
to the Secretary , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre
you find out about this ''
his arm around at the furnishings
not a discourteous question , Lawrence decided
man had so little time to learn he had to be curious ; ; he had to find out
did not tell him at what cost , at what loneliness , he learned these things
said , `` Any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home ''
President said , `` If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President's home , let me know
do business with that kind ''
Lawrence thought a little sadly , these were the fees of poverty and ambition
not have the chance to grow up graciously
to acquire everything he was going to get in four years
brandy in the library
at Lawrence with a searching glance , the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial

President said with a slight bluster , `` There isn't anyone who loves the President more than I do
is my ideal
same time , you have to face facts and realize that a man who's been in the Marine Corps all his life doesn't understand much about politics

with the practiced , deceptive calm of the lawyer , but his face was in the shadow
, we have to protect the old man for his own good
what I mean
full of politicians , and if you want to get along with them , you have to be politic
why I say we just can't go ahead and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses

looked at him coldly and said , `` Take it or leave it ''
there was nothing else to do
caught in a machine
was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let's go and see what it's like ''
about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham , near the Georgia border and on the Tallahoosa River , a small and dirty stream
was a center of manufacture , especially in textiles , and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings , a residence for many owners of the great industries in north Alabama
had , as was usual in southern cities of this sort , a Black Bottom , a low region near the river where the Negroes lived -- servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river , where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime
by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were
industries and factories
went down to Black Bottom
midst of this crowded region was the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church
an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair
was a landmark
been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it
just suffered a calamity , the final crisis in a long series of calamities
old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead , and the city mourned him
a loud-voiced man , once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability
stern and overbearing with his flock , but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites , especially the rich who partly supported the church
Board , headed by a black man named Carlson , had practically taken over as the pastor grew old , and had its way with the support of the Amen corner
thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious orgy
of old worshippers , chiefly women , listened weekly to a sermon
invariably in low tones , almost conversational , and then gradually worked up to high , shrill appeals to God and man
the Amen corner took hold , re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus , spreading down through the African forest , overseas to the West Indies , and then here in Alabama
and slow dance , with tears and song , with scream and contortion , the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering , wailing , shouting , possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force
to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed Negro religion
ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor
of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week
often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting
on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like disgust
preached a short sermon , trying to talk man-to-man to the audience , to tell them who he was , what he had done in Macon and Birmingham , and what he proposed to do here
with them on the loss of their old pastor
, at mention of that name , the Amen corner broke loose
no chance to say another word
very end , when the audience was silent and breathless , a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out
did not think much of the new pastor , and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say
next weeks he looked over the situation
all there was the parsonage , an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in , originally poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years , with no plumbing or sewage , with rat-holes and rot
arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church , a woman named Catt who , as Wilson afterward found , was briefly referred to as The Cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative
was a lonely , devoted soul , never married , conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church , but a perpetual dissenter and born critic
over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository
looked over the church and studied its condition
of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears
up his mind that he must receive at least $2,500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing
itself must be repaired
dirty and neglected
ought to be rebuilt , and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this
the city itself should be talked to
in the colored section were dirty
typhoid and malaria
had nowhere to go and no place to play , not even sidewalks
was small , dark and ill-equipped
was a pliant fool
two liquor saloons not very far from the church , one white , that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for Negroes ; ; the other exclusively Negro
there was a good deal of gambling in both
other side of the church was a quiet , well-kept house with shutters and recently painted
about it
called Kent House
of the church , Carlson , was its janitor
the leading members of the Amen corner was cook ; ; there were two or three colored maids employed there
told that it was a sort of hotel for white people , which seemed to him rather queer
a white hotel be set down in the center of Black Bottom
it looked respectable
glad to have it there
of Black Bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect , disrepair and careful upkeep
carefully repaired huts , and nicely painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl with little distinction
could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better
, front and back , were narrow ; ; some were trash dumps , some had flower gardens
privies , for there was no sewage system
about a bit , Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom , across the river and far removed from the white city , a considerable tract of land , and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot
about it to the Presiding Elder
Elder looked him over rather carefully
not sure what kind of a man he had in hand
was one thing that he had to stress , and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses , the dollar money , had been seriously falling behind in this church , and that must be looked after immediately
, he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had been sent here -- to make a larger contribution of dollar money
the fact that clear as this was , they must have a better church , a more business-like conduct of the church organization , and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization
to the Presiding Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river
Elder was sure that that would be impossible
told Wilson to `` go ahead and try ''
tried
seem impossible
which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears , and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in , and that none would be sold to colored folk
was proposed to rebuild the church , Wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high
sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed
this proposal was made to his Deacon Board , he met unanimous opposition
certainly would not be removed
proposition was sacrilege
been here fifty years
going to stay forever
hardly possible to get any argument on the subject
rebuilding , well , that might be looked into , but there was no hurry , no hurry at all
went downtown to a different banker , an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic , but he shook his head
'' , he said , `` I think you don't quite understand the situation here
see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church
stores , saloons , some gambling , I hope not too much
people are getting employment at Kent House and other places , and they are near their places of employment
city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them
if I were you I would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years
time , perhaps something better can be done ''
asked , `` What about this Kent House which you mention
understand why a white hotel should be down here ''
banker looked at him with a certain surprise , and then he said flatly : `` I'm afraid I can't tell you anything in particular about Kent House
to find out about it on your own
see you again ''
dismissed the colored pastor
next day that Sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand
, `` My dear , do you know what Kent House is ''
'' , said Wilson , `` I don't
just asking about it
it ''
a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as inmates
a good deal of local labor , including two members of our Trustee Board
some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen in town ''
at her
dear , you must be mistaken ''
to Mrs. Catt '' , she said
Wilson had talked to Mrs. Catt and to others , he was absolutely amazed
of course , was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities -- putting white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly
had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages
situation of Kent House was more subtle
involved were larger and more regular
were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction
from the white town was greater and there was little publicity
, patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes
Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go
him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the Methodist church , if not in all churches
in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold
a fog , which increased the darkness of the night
lamps were no more than a misleading glow
have been anywhere or nowhere
was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi
State Seward was a sick man
had come from Herold , who had once been a chemist's clerk
were always receiving medicines
would question such an errand
was filled up with flour
loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward's home , where Key had once been killed
would have another death
outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry
heavily up the stoop and rang the bell
bell at Mass , the doorbell was pitched too high
still Good Friday , after all
boy opened the door
not notice him
thinking chiefly of Cap
schedules were to synchronize , there was no point in wasting time
his way inside
moment the hall confused him
the largest house he had ever been in , almost the largest building , except for a hotel
no idea where Seward's room would be
half darkness the banisters gleamed , and the hall seemed enormous
somewhere were the bedrooms
be up there
his errand , but without bothering much to make it plausible , for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army
not really want to kill , but as in the sexual act , there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed , even while you watched yourself giving way to it
no longer worried
be all right
that in this mood he could not be stopped
the sensation always surprised him
a thrill he felt no part in
only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick , appalling , and efficient things
by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs
carpeted , but made for pumps and congress gaiters , not the great clodhoppers he wore
of his footsteps was like a muffled drum
top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown
and whispered his errand
Seward held out his hand
little , Payne shook his head
had told him to deliver his package in person
said his father was sleeping , and then went through a pantomime at his father's door , to prove the statement
well '' , Payne said
will go ''
, but now that he knew where the elder Seward was , he did not intend to go
out his pistol and fired it
no sound
misfired
, he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's head , over and over again
the first blow that was always difficult
, violence was exultantly easy
caught up into it and became a different person
did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real
boy fled down the stairs , screaming , `` Murder ''
not murder at all
more methodical than that
merely clearing a way to what he had to do
for the sick room , found his pistol was broken , and threw it away
would do
he had known all about knives
the door from inside
it in and tumbled into darkness
only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled
for the bed , jumped on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly
like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams
pulled him off
anything
at their arms
a lady there , in a nightdress
not have wanted to hurt a lady
approached , this one fully dressed
knife went into his chest , he went down at once
mad '' , shouted Payne , as he ran out into the hall
mad '' , and only wished he had been
have made things so much easier
was not mad
only dreaming
down the stairs and out of the door
the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder
wakes up , even from one's own dreams
air revived him
he saw , had fled
one did not expect much of people like Herold
his horse , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on
boy was close behind him
nigger boy turned back and he was alone
on and on
no idea where he was
time he came to an open field
field was better than a building , that was for sure , so he dismounted , turned off the horse , and plunged through the grass
curiously sleepy , the world seemed far away ; ; he knew he should get to Cap , but he didn't know how
sure , for he had done as he was told , hadn't he
find him and take care of him
a good tree , he clambered up into it , found a comfortable notch , and curled up in it to sleep , like the tousled bear he was , with his hands across his chest , as though surfeited with honey
made him tired , but he was not frightened
, Edwin Booth was winding up a performance of A New Way To Pay Old Debts
a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more
him
stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual
Giles Overreach ( how often had he had to play that part , who did not believe a word of it ) , he raised his arm and declaimed : `` Where is my honour now ''
one of the high spots of the play
, as usual , loved it
delighted to see them so happy
had any worries , it was only the small ones , about Mother in New York , and his daughter Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour , with her Aunt Asia , in Philadelphia
ambivalent about his profession , if he has practised it long enough , but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up to you
the world seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not
Wilkes was quite right about one thing
had been in the green room
had brought her into the wings
could not act , one part suited her as well as any other , and so she was the first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water , holding it up to the box , high above her head , to Miss Harris , who had asked for it
been one of the first to collect her wits
not so much that the shot had stunned the audience , as that they had been stunned already
them had seen Our American Cousin before , and unless Miss Keene was on stage , there was not much to it
was hot and they were drugged with boredom
had been empty , except for Harry Hawk , doing his star monologue
was fond of Harry Hawk , he was a dear , in or out of character , but he was not particularly funny
end of the monologue the audience would applaud
looked at the scenery
, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out , you sockdologizing old mantrap ''
, otherwise Hawk
always a pause here , before the next line
when the gun went off
that explosion did not mean much
going off all over Washington City these days , because of the celebrations , and the theatre was not soundproof
audience saw a small , dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box
semper tyrannis '' , it said mildly
delivered his line
billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke
forward
not heard what had been said
been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily
leapt from the box , almost lost its balance , the flag draped there tore in the air , the figure landed on its left leg , fell on its hands , and pressed itself up
still had his arm raised towards the wings
faltered
not lower his arm
was so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one
for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon
looked like the slave dealer from that
also looked like a toad , hopping away from the light
something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them
disappeared into the wings
had not shifted position , but he at last lowered his arm
screamed
no mistaking that scream
what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do
scream had a different note in it
of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water
, one of the guests in the box , stood up and demanded water
was involuntary
unexpected happened , one always asked for water if one were a woman , brandy if one were a man
screamed again
Presidential box someone leaned over the balustrade and yelled : `` He has shot the President ''
everybody up
stage , Harry Hawk began to weep
brushed by him with the glass of water
began to move
City everyone lived in a bubble of plots , and one death might attract another
not exactly panic they gave way to , but they could not just sit there
voices , for no one could bear silence , drowned out the sound of Mrs. Lincoln's weeping
rear of the auditorium , upstairs , some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor
not give
Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box
audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob , on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water
the corridor door from the inside , and called for a doctor
Charles Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor
straight to the Presidential box

he was bleeding to death
look of him he wasn't that far gone

feel himself toppling
the ground coming up -- and the stranger's head
ferocity , he brought his fists together and struck
encountered silky hair and hard bone
uttered a weird cry , spun about , and collapsed in the sand
to her feet , Stevie agilely retaining his seat
reared , and now , wickedly , he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger
feel his own feet , iron-shod , striking repeatedly until the body was limp
, and his lips slavered
himself chortling
around and around to trample the figure into the sand
top of the head , with a spot bare and white as a clamshell , remained visible
shouting triumphantly
hooted
he chilled
pursuing him
frightened ; ; his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt
stumbled , and again he was falling , falling


was nudging him , but he was still falling

vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it

boom and a throbbing echo
bulged , the floor trembled , the windowpanes rattled
at the far morning , expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon

to the window and yanked at the sash

was old , the paint alligatored

breeze saluted him

his head out
the slate roof of the church ; ; ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green-scaled monster
which had struck presented an innocent face
kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards
a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high
loudest clock in the whole world ''

, and sped outdoors
Broome Street to Orange Square
leaned backward , while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long , shapeless coat
seemed to hold up the sky
, basking in the foothills , was the city of God
Reformed Church , with two steeples and its own school was on Main Street ; ; the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street ; ; the Catholic Saint Mary's Church , with an even taller steeple and a cross on top , stood on Ball Street
had the largest cemetery , near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south ; ; Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds
everywhere , in the belfry , in the steeple , in the clouds , in the trees , and in the mountains hulking on the horizon
beyond , where shadows lurked , must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached and the dreadful Lake of Fire
walking in awe , he became familiar with God , who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church with its high steeple and clock
no church like Drew Church , no preacher like Papa , who was intimate with Him , and could consign sinners to hellfire
God he must follow in Papa's footsteps
fortunate , and proud
, idling on their benches in the Square , beneath the soldiers' monument , got to their feet when Papa approached : `` Morning , Reverend ''
and His will -- Stevie could not divide God from his Papa -- illumined every parish face , turned the choir into a band of angels , and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven

went out to do God's work , Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare
journeyed westerly as far as Germantown , beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine shop , and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal , and northward to Brooklyn , below Point Peter , he could see the church spire wherever he looked back
went south and rolled past the tollhouse -- `` Afternoon , Reverend ''
crossed the suspension bridge to Matamoras ; ; that was Pennsylvania
Delaware River , three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush
Laurel Grove Cemetery , and below the junction of the Neversink and the Delaware , was the Tri-State Rock , from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania , as well as New York , simply by spinning around on his heel
excursions , Papa instructed him on man's chief end , which was his duty to God and his own salvation
a boy's lively eyes might rove
Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent swimming hole
a scornful finger at the splashing youth : `` Idle recreation ''
no idols ; ; it troubled him that he couldn't always see what Papa saw
torn between the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the Monticello Branch

with all his strength at the heavy , brass-bound door , and shuffled along the wainscoted wall
, mysterious presence of God was all around him
end of a shaft of light , the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon
, standing before a curtained window in the study room , was his father , hands tucked under his coattails , and staring into the dark church
was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence
shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles and gray hair

was thin-lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide
slender fingers removed the spectacles , there were red indentations on the bridge of the strong nose

give Him your affection and store up His love for you
heart to Him and pray , Stephen , pray
mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the Lake of Fire ''
heard these words many times , yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble
feared the Lake of Fire
to think of God and His eternal wrath ; ; he must pray to be spared
disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the Call
, Townley , or Ted , certainly not Ludie
at Hackettstown and Will at Albany Law School , where they surely could not hear it
would choose him
hear the Call and would run to tell Papa
face would relax , the black-clad arms would embrace him , `` My son ''
might he know the Call when it came
as in Scriptures , a still , small voice would whisper
summon him once ; ; if he missed it , never again
it came when he was playing , or was asleep and dreaming
not fail to hear it
Papa's chosen ; ; therefore , nothing but good could happen to him , even in God's wrathful storms
skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley , he was unafraid
fly into a closet , shut the door and bury her head in the clothes ; ; he dared to wait for the lightning

storm , the sky cleared blue and cool , and fragrant air swept the hills
sun came out , Stevie strode proudly into Orange Square , smiling like a landlord on industrious tenants
had brimmed over , the cannon were wet , the soldiers' monument glistened
the benches had dried , the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places
spire shone as if the lightning had polished it

Christophers' lawn , little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at a tea party
sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size

whether God had a dog in the sky
down Pike Street , past the First National Bank with its green window shades
the tracks to Delaware House , where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah

taller than Aggie
so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked

been pretty scared himself , wondering what the hell was coming off
soon saw which way the ball was bouncing
back to his senses
soon came back to my senses '' , he said , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report to some important superior
the first to get my squad on the ball , and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb
thum
redheader was the worst
sayin , not me , not me , I don't wanta wind up like em

by God
a good thing it happened
stop it now , once for all
place up
it now
the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow
the guys that done it
something troubling him though : as yet they hadn't Five days

of annoyance ran through him
blinked hard , snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him
began to whirl inside his head
his favorites : `` Guitar Boogie ''
came on , faithfully , just like a radio or juke box , whenever he started to worry too much about something , when the bad things tried to push their way into him
drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments , humming and jiving within , beating the rhythm within
with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them
bastards over to me -- to me and my boys -- no nigger ever got what would be comin to them -- reactionary bastards
never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began
a word he was proud of , a word that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure , almost as if it were an exclusive possession , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated , four cuts above any of the folks back home
cuts at least '' , he chuckled to himself , `` and I owe it all to them ''
also made him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so labeled
it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball
up again and again in the discussion sessions
bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months

hard lackeys of the Warmongering capitalists
, sent here
up the program
remember that
He heard himself haranguing them
himself before them delivering the speech
, suddenly , feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention
, Ching had told him ( smiling , patting him on the back ) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders , `` Keep it up , your squad is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep up the good work ''

really something , coming from Ching
something '' , he said , aloud
bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards
get them by God and let them bring them down here to me , just let them , God , I'll slice their balls right off
arm moved swiftly , violently , once , twice
intense satisfaction
tingling within
, mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay
as if it had been done
'' , he said aloud , spitting on them
, and looked around
cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him
came back , the one nagging at him these past four days
to stifle it
words were forming
he couldn't
himself
start thinkin
it , seeking to kill the last few words , but on they came out
trembling , a strange feeling upon him , fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot
didn't
took heart ; ; the final word came forth
heard it , fully ; ; `` bout takin his place '' He listened , waited , nothing happened
good
self
arrived , taking him its rhythm
, snaked all through him , the lyrics lifted him , took him from one magic isle to another , stopping briefly at each Brandon

the guy says he is trying
isn't with it , not at all with it
talked to Ching about it , he said , Everyone can learn , if he is not a Reactionary or lazy
is stupid
he said
know
plain as hell Johnson is no reactionary
not tryin , Johnson , you bastard you
over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of revulsion
loathed him
soft-spoken Johnson , Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad
the guy what always goofed at Question Time
they have dumped him off on someone else

the damn Reactionaries bump him off

particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind
surged up , but it failed to check it
the man to take His place
with most on the Ball

up
score With a supreme effort , he broke it off
to the window again
and gnashing within him
was tumbling down furiously now
hitting the ground , piling higher and higher
at it , amazed , alarmed

got to be somebody If I don't put my two cents in soon , somebody else will I know they're waitin only for one thing : for the bastards what done it to be nailed

Quick -- now ''
shrank before the hot fury , searching frantically for the answer
up
a hell of a noise this time of morning
out the window
sake
fucken sky's caved in
for the source of the noise that had awakened him
that prick Coughlin
hell was he up to now
he drop dead
they miss him when they got Slater

was asking himself the usual early morning questions : What the Hell am I doin here
a nut-house

dreamin
in the hut came Coughlin's voice

like Coughlin run it anyway , one way or another

over and tried to shut out the noise , now much louder
into the blanket

sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water
, wide as the Missouri , where it ran by his place
was spinning
was not

I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning
asked this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut )
the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him
make out what he was saying
it had to do with the log
he be concerned
so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books , too
the two men are riding into the country , where they are going to dinner , they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves , who strip them of everything , including most of their clothes
must be a very learned man '' , says Voltaire to one of the bandits
learned man ''
laughs in his face
perseveres
to the chief himself
what university did you study ''

to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution
have become so corrupt '' , he says , `` surely you must have studied many arts and sciences ''
, annoyed by these questions , knocks Voltaire down and shouts at him that he not only never went to any school , but never even learned how to read
the two bedraggled men reach their friend's home , Voltaire's fears are once again aroused
is such a distinguished place , with such fine works of art and such a big library , that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved by all this culture
surprise , however , their host gives them fresh clothes to put on , opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner
dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor
have pen and paper , please
in a hurry to write another essay against culture
the impromptu that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans Souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe , to be printed sometime later , but with the name of Timon of Athens , the famous misanthrope , substituted for that of Rousseau

the same time how understandable
the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the frauds , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life
for example , could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find himself when , soon after the furor of his first Discourse , he acquired still another title to fame
as a musician
composer
he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera
facility in this genre was not great
efforts to get a performance for his Gallant Muses invariably failed
good reasons
music had little merit
one day , while on a week's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss jeweler , Rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written , to which he attached no great importance
really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs
a few such songs together '' , they urged him
them onto some sort of little plot , and you'll have a delightful operetta ''
believe them
'' , he said
is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away ''
forbid ''
ladies , enchanted by his music
must make an opera out of this material ''
wouldn't leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised
the irony and the bitterness of it
all his years of effort to become a composer , he should now , now when he was still stoutly replying to the critics of his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences , be so close to a success in music and have to reject it
least appear to reject it
else could he do
on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time practice them , could you
yes , perhaps in literature , since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself
music too

be too much
fault , of course , was Rameau's
was Rameau's and that of the whole culture of this Parisian age
was Rameau's type of music that he had been trying to write , and that he couldn't write
songs , however , were sweet nothings from the heart , tender memories of his childhood , little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep

appear as a composer now
, craved for so long , was now forbidden to him
just for the ladies , and just for this once , for this one weekend in the country , he would make a little piece out of his melodies
were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded
went to work to learn the parts which he wrote
, after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited
aware that he must seem like a hypocrite , standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance
especially couldn't understand what troubled him

what was a contradiction in one's life
has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes , and saying yes when she meant no
to admit that though he couldn't agree to a public performance , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction , dearly love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices
simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think '' , he said
the historian , pointed out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible
of the Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound
satisfy the author's curiosity

recalled that Rameau had once had a private performance of his opera Armide , behind closed doors , just for himself alone
what was bothering Rousseau : that the writer of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta
certainly be paradoxical
thought he saw a way out
me do the submitting to the Royal Academy '' , he suggested
name will never appear
will even suspect that it is your work ''
Rousseau could agree
what crazy twists and turns of his emotions
one and the same time that his work might be turned down -- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author -- and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself
anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause
torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity , Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks
emotions were screwed up to new heights when , after acceptance and the first rehearsals , there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King's amusements , and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau
honor of it
was your answer ''
asked , striving to appear unimpressed
refused '' , Duclos said
else could I do
Cury was incensed , of course
said I would first have to get the author's permission
was certain he would refuse ''
all this was
not this success come to him before he had plunged into his Discourse , and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial
when everything was opening up to him -- even the court of Louis 15
had to play a role of self-effacement
forth Duclos had to go , between M. De Cury and Jean Jacques and between the Duke D'Aumont and Jean Jacques again , as his little operetta , The Village Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took on ever more importance
course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends
, naturally , kept his secret well , and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles
it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer , but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals
was such that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational
to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe , Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration , trembling lest his authorship become known , and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer
himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point of his life
was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave
contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days
in that condition , and about to enter the hall where the King , the Queen , the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present , Grimm and the Abbe Raynal and others tried to stop him
can't go in that way ''

not ''
asked
is going to stop me ''
haven't dressed for the occasion ''
out to him
dressed as I always am '' , Rousseau said
better nor worse ''
home , yes '' , they argued
here you are in the palace
King
De Pompadour ''
they are here , then surely I have the right to be here '' , Rousseau said
even more right
am the composer ''
in such a slovenly condition ''
is slovenly about me ''

it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face
would grow there whether I washed myself or not
years ago I would have worn a beard with pride
without beards would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion
have changed , and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face
fashion
is the real king here
15 , , since even he obeys
if you don't mind , I should like to hear my own piece performed ''
course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold at all
lest his piece should fail
in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society , his fear of making some inane or inappropriate remark
deeper than that : his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself
walk out in the midst of his piece
before the court
King
the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began
from Concord was as good as his word
spurring and whooping down the road , his horse kicking up clouds of dust , shouting : `` They're a-coming
, they're a-coming , they are ''
him before he ever showed , and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight
hadn't misjudged the strength of his lungs , not at all
you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance
observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man , and when a very small man is up on a saddle , he'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there
, and I appreciate the sentiment
this rider , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes , I can't say ; ; but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction
thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall , and this dashing rider made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation
down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us , and we crouched behind it
heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars , but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant
felt about the redcoats , we respected them in terms of their trade , which was killing ; ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun
to wipe my flint , but I didn't dare to , the state my hands were in , just as I didn't dare to do anything about the priming
would fire or not , just as chance willed
a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun , because the most important thing I had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it
, which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now , stopped for long enough to count to twenty ; ; and in that brief interval , a redcoat officer came tearing down the road , whipping his horse fit to kill
know whether he was after our rider , who had gone by a minute before , or whether he was simply scouting conditions ; ; but when he passed us by , a musket roared , and he reared his horse , swung it around , and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come
a fine and showy rider , but his skill was wasted on us
me and somewhere behind me , a rifle cracked
officer collapsed like a punctured bolster , and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle , except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup
by the weight dragging , the dust , and the heat , the horse leaped our wall , dashing out the rider's brains against it , and leaving him lying there among us -- while the horse crashed away through the brush
my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays ; ; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ; but this grinning , broken head , not ten feet away from me , was the sharp definition of what my reality had become
the redcoats were coming , and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us
state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; ; the passage and rhythm of time changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event is a separate and frozen incident
recollection , there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats , and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely
could not have been more than a matter of seconds , and then the front of the British army came into view
only hours since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed
very front rank , two men were wounded and staggered along , trailing blood behind them
here , no pipers , and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust
with bayonets fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and torment
rank of them came down the road , and the faces were all the same , and they walked in a sea of dust
, hold your fire
fire ''
called , and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant , only some of them glancing toward the stone wall , from behind which the voice came
of their column had already passed us , when another officer came riding down the side of the road , not five paces from where we were
Simmons carried a musket , but he had loaded it with bird shot , and as the officer came opposite him , he rose up behind the wall and fired
there was a man in the saddle ; ; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks , and during the next second or two , we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers
, the road was filled with disciplined troops , marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death ; ; the next , a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound , out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury
course of this , they had fired on us ; ; but I have no memory of that
squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; ; and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound , hurling more vile language than I ever thought I knew , sobbing and shouting , and aware that if I had passed water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet
have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there ; ; and then I came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons by far
was running
realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall
hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching
to a stop in Deacon Gordon's cow hole , a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle
cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment , with the crazy excitement of our first encounter , the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road , and the thirst of some of the men , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it
, one of the men from Lincoln , had taken a musket ball in his belly ; ; and though he had found the strength to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground , dying , the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow
appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac -- except the Reverend
that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself
drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road , and the fact that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next
I reloaded my gun , as the other men were doing
less than a quarter of a mile from the road , and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it
looked , you saw Committeemen running across the meadows , some away from the road , some toward it , some parallel to it ; ; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty Militia were making their way in our direction
and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column , but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road
offer any advice , but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out
that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning , and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass , what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts
was being discussed , we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road
the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle of the North Bridge , which entitled them to a sort of veteran status , and we felt that if they employed this tactic , it was likely enough the best one
said : `` It makes sense
cluster together , the redcoats can make an advantage out of it , but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us , and we can outrun them ''
it , and we broke into parties of two and three
Dover decided to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac Pitt until life passed away -- and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world
off with Cousin Simmons , who maintained that if he didn't see to me , he didn't know who would
heavens , Adam '' , he said , `` I thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place ''
learned that now '' , I said
east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road , panting from the effort and soaked with sweat
a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road , and the shouting and gunfire never slackened
trees , there was a dead redcoat , a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimples , who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes
were around him
stripped him of his musket and equipment , and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off
grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away
name , what are you to rob the dead with the fight going on ''
roared
to outface him , but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men , and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him
the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer
no longer permitted in the streets
and other places of prostitution were emptied
breeches had to go
no longer tolerated
, a chinless reprobate , Jake Camaret , marched down the aisle in St. Peter's one Sunday morning , followed by one of the women from the Bordel , whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame
down on the front bench , they turned to smirk at those around them
impulse was to denounce their blasphemy
thought occurred that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him
opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well
the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor God and man
morning , as the clock struck nine , he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town Hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be respected
have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur Favre said rudely
to the preaching of the Gospel ''
in anger
is the answer the ungodly will always make when the Church points its fingers at their sins
to you that the Church will ever decry evil ''
was like a declaration of war
sat down in his high-backed stall , lips compressed , eyes glinting
, a short man with a rotunda of stomach , rose
was on him as he began to speak
Master Calvin says is true
we have a good city unless we respect morality ''
, a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes , got to his feet
all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are brazenly living together
be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers ''
, the son of the famous patriot , disagreed
not listen to that Frenchman
throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win ''
quietly insistent
can be no compromise when souls are in jeopardy ''
later the sentence of the Council was carried out : Jake Camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a mocking populace
stalked the beadle , proclaiming as he went , `` Thus the Council deals with those who break its laws -- adulterers , thieves , murderers , and lewd persons
contemplate their ways , and let every man beware ''
raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister Mary
died two weeks before , in early November , without being reconciled to the Church
, in a body , had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the Church , but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith
taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet , so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned
of St. Eloi , Claude De Mommor , had been a good friend , but not even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground
his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's bedroom , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs
Virgin was still there , but no one knelt before her now
Varnessa ; ; she , too , prayed only to God
instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte , the touch of his mother's hand , the lilt of Charles's voice in the square raftered rooms , his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons , and the sight of the beloved bishop
had to follow the light
expected a man to believe the Holy Scriptures , why had He given them to him
trees stood like specters in the February night
the streets and covered the slanting rooftops , as John trudged toward St. Peter's
crunched by , its dim lights filtering through the gloom
wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes , his only ones , now patched with folded parchment
had recently given him a small salary , but it was not enough to supply even necessities
neared the square , a round figure muffled in a long , black cape whisked by
Ablard Corne and called out a greeting
he was to such men
several on the Council who tried to live like Christians
efforts , the problems seemed to grow graver all the time
steps , John entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells
big one , in the silent moonlight , lay a dead pigeon , and on the smaller bell , the Clemence , two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air
upon the stone balustrade
back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes
moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks ; ; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars
very still , his arms at his sides , staring up at the heavens , then down at the blinking lights below
long , my Lord

never asked for an easy task , but I am weary of the strife ''
difficult these days
him
were frequent
through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter Robert , Nerien , Nicholas Cop , Martin Bucer , and even the compromising Louis Du Tillet
traveler from Italy brought news of Peter Robert , who was now distributing his Bible among the Waldensian peasants
regularly from Nerien , Nicholas , and Martin
Anthony and William to confide in and consult
continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church
it difficult , but he held him in check
was busy most of the time courting this girl and that
good looks made him a favorite with the ladies
instead of becoming the City of God , as John had dreamed , had in the two years since he had been there , continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished
in , signing the Confession and rules in order to remain , and then disregarding them
, prostitutes plied their trade , thieves stole , murderers stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed
were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by
the heroism of the past and demanded : `` Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope , Master Calvin , to curtail our liberty
oh why , doesn't he stick to preaching the Gospel , instead of meddling in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social issues that are no concern of the Church ''
reply was always the same : `` Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church
have righteousness ''
behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight
confusion cleared , he would not be coming here much longer
threat would become a reality , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of `` that Frenchman ''
tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie
first , the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind


he doing here at this hour
down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher , who had been one of the early Gospelers in Paris

you
to warn you of a plot ''
above him , his face ashen

like a man grown old , he took Eli's hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned
''
tiredly
Favre just paid me a visit
to your rooms , and Anthony told me you were here
, Caroli and Benoit , are to challenge you and William to a debate before the Council
to be a trap
the law : if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge , you will be banished ''
will be the subject ''
are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal ''
fear fused in John
the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of Christ
refused to believe that He was the eternal Son of God were termed Arianists
had come to Geneva , saying that he had been a bishop of the Church of Rome and had been persecuted in Paris for his Reformed faith
to be appointed a preacher
Sept had unmasked him , revealing he had never been a bishop , but was an Anabaptist , afraid to state his faith , because he knew John Calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death
had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher , and now Caroli sought revenge

William agrees , we should insist on a public debate '' , he said at length
is more to the conspiracy
that the Lord's Supper be administered here as it used to be , with unleavened bread
Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council , preach only the word of God and stop meddling in politics ''
was always the spirit with Christ ; ; matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential
remain a sovereign state
not yield to the demands of Bern ''
played over Eli's flowing white locks and rugged features
Favre indicated that if I would co-operate , after you and William are banished , following the debate , I will be given a place of influence ''
was your reply to that ''
I would rather be banished with two such Christians than be made the Chief Syndic ''
morning , as John entered the Place Molard on his way to visit a sick refugee , he had a premonition of danger
a group of men and dogs circled him
to run , but he knew that if he did , he would be lost
very still , his heart thumping wildly
outskirts of the rabble the Camaret brothers and Gaspard Favre shook their fists
you going to comply with the demands of Bern ''
Jake called
''
with a big blob of a nose roared
''
his hand for silence
this : the ministers will not yield to the demands of Bern ''
shook a little
a stone
instant John was stunned
felt the side of his head , his fingers came away covered with blood
could duck , another stone struck him

him be now ''
, the gaming-card manufacturer said , his little pig eyes glaring
have taught him a lesson ''
moved back and John started dizzily down the hill
him as he staggered forward
slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow
a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him
more horrible than the rest , lunged , growling deep in his throat , his hair bristling
difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run , sweat pouring down his face
the shelter of the tent -- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped , no longer drumming -- Adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beer barrels
, of course , no real need to rearrange everything
inch this way or that for the hardbake , or the toffee , or the barley sugar , or the sardines , or the bitters , or the condensed milk , or the stationery , or the needles -- what could it mean
his own hands make the caressing , anxious movement that , when rain falls and nobody comes , and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the ankles , has been the ritual of stall vendors , forever
the gesture
its meaning
seen a dry , old , yellowing hand reach out , with that painful solicitude , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object worth a pfennig
Bavaria he had seen that gesture , and at that sight his heart had always died within him
occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand , whatever face it might be
face was his own
what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face
if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism
was no need , he remembered , for his hand to reach out , for his face to show concern or stoicism
nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came
was he assuming the role -- the gesture and the suffering
he expiating
he now taking the role -- the gesture and the suffering -- because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid , befogged loneliness of this land
Virginia
out of the tent at the company street
dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street
misty gray of the rain , he saw the stretching hutment , low diminutive log cabins , chinked with mud , with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through , with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes , or fence rails , with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud
of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out
heavy air , however , that device did not seem to help
from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle , creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof
door was a board with large , inept lettering : home sweet home
the hut of Simms Purdew , the hero
were huddled in those lairs
the names of some
the faces of all , hairy or shaven , old or young , fat or thin , suffering or hardened , sad or gay , good or bad
stood about his tent , chaffing each other , exchanging their obscenities , cursing command or weather , he had studied their faces
had the need to understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh , behind the oath , the banter , the sadness
looking at Simms Purdew , the only man in the world whom he hated , he had seen the heavy , slack , bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel , obscene banter , and had seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment , and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that vile creature
seeing , somehow , the face of a young boy , the boy Simms Purdew must once have been , a boy with sorrel hair , and blue eyes dancing with gaiety , and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles
moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die
suddenly opened to joy
that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms Purdew , something about his own life , and all life , would be clear and simple
Purdew would turn to him and say : `` Adam , you know when I was a boy , it was a funny thing happened
you now '' -- If only Simms Purdew could do that , whatever the thing he remembered and told
be a sign for the untellable , and he , Adam , would understand
Adam , in the gray light of afternoon , stared across at the hut opposite his tent , and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there in the gloom , snoring on his bunk , with the fumes of whisky choking the air
the sign above the door of the hut : home sweet home
the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street , with an armful of wood
Pullen James , the campmate of Simms Purdew
the wood , carried the water , did the cooking , cleaning and mending , and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his pains
the moisture flow from the poncho
the rubberized fabric a dull gleam , like metal
humbly lowered his head , pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut , and was gone from sight
at the door and remembered that Simms Purdew had been awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at Antietam
was again empty
was slacking off now , but the light was grayer
interest , Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him
emptiness of the street , and his spirit , moved a form
was swathed in an army blanket , much patched , fastened at the neck with a cord
the shapeless huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud
wore army shoes , in obvious disrepair
was wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been flung
face stared straight ahead in the drizzle
down the cheeks , gathered at the tip of the nose , and at the chin
was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there
stopped and one hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose
figure moved on
one of the Irish women who had built their own huts down near the river
washing
this one
her because she was the one who , in a winter twilight , on the edge of camp , had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly
o' mutton , bhoy ''
queried in her soft guttural
o' mutton ''
was Mollie
her Mollie the Mutton , and laughed
the street after her , Adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket
not make out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose
Mutton was scratching her nose
ran crazily in his head : Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain
words fell into a pattern : `` Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose , Scratching her nose in the rain
Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain ''
would not stop
again and again
trapped in that pattern , in the repetition
thought he might weep
the matter with me ''
out loud
wildly around , at the now empty street , at the mud , at the rain
, what's the matter with me ''

had stored his stock in the great oak chest , locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain , tied the fly of the tent , and picked up the cash box , he moved up the darkening street
consign the cash box into the hands of Jed Hawksworth , then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold
-- Then what
not know
closed on that prospect , as though fog had descended to blot out a valley
, in the dusk , he heard voices singing , muffled but strong
of the huts a group of men were huddled together , singing

to hear
the words : `` Rock of Ages , cleft for me , Let me hide myself in Thee
water and the blood From Thy riven side flow
thought : I am a Jew from Bavaria
standing there , he thought , in Virginia , in the thickening dusk , in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another Jew
Jew , a young man too , had left that greatcoat behind , in a rich house , and marched away
crossed the river which now , beyond the woods yonder , was sliding darkly under the mist
plunged into the dark woods beyond
died there
that man , that other young Jew , felt as he stood in the twilight and heard other men , far away , singing together
of the hutments , regiment after regiment , row after row , the thousands of huts , stretching away into the night
of the men , the nameless thousands , huddling in them
of Simms Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen James crouched by the hearth , skirmishing an undershirt for lice , and a wet log sizzled
of Simms Purdew , who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield , a maniacal scream on his lips , and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him
of Simms Purdew rising up , fearless in glory
the sweetness of pity flood through him , veining his very flesh
, lying in the huts , they did not know
not know who they were or know their own worth
pity for them his loneliness was gone
thought of Aaron Blaustein standing in his rich house saying : `` God is tired of taking the blame
going to let History take the blame for a while ''
of the old man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier
: Only in my heart can I make the world hang together
from the crouch necessary to enter the hut
Mose squatting by the hearth , breaking up hardtack into a pan
was boiling on the coals
give Ole Buckra all his money ''
softly

'' , Mose murmured , `` yeah
what he done give us ''
at the pot

'' , Mose said , and theatrically licked his lips

his lips again
`` yeah

the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boiling pot of lobscouse

stirring and looked over his shoulder
what Ole Buckra et tonight ''

what I had to fix fer Ole Him ''

'' , Mose said
a child too much a part of her environment , too eager to grow and learn and experience
they were at Easthampton for the summer ( again , Fritzie said , a good place , even though they were being robbed )
evening -- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts everything -- Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk
on the couch reading ; ; Laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away
, in white terry-cloth bathrobe , her face intense and purposeful , had essayed a few wobbly steps toward her father
wanna walk -- walk '' , he said
gently , he shoved her behind toward Laura
-- making it halfway across the cottage floor
not a second , picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura
took her gently and shoved her off again , toward Fritzie : Amy did not laugh -- this was work , concentration , achievement
few minutes she was making the ten-foot hike unaided ; ; soon she was parading around the house , flaunting her new skill
logic , a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the window ( a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill Fritzie had given her ) , consoled her for a moment
to be safe , had to come back to them -- if only to reap that share of life's experiences that were her due , if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her
swathings of terror , she jabbed deceit's sharp point -- Amy would be reborn , a new child , with new parents , living under new circumstances
was short-lived , yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion
her husband's drugged body , his chest rising and falling in mindless rhythms , she saw the grandeur of his fictional world , that lush garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs
him
him
darkness , she saw him stirring
to be muttering , his voice surprisingly clear
should have let me take that money out '' , Andrus said
minute I'd have been fine
have let me do it ''
his hand
, I know , Fritzie
have ''
heat intensified on Tuesday
gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell , drier , more enervating , more laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past
continue this way , hitting 106 and more in the Valley , Joe McFeeley knew , into October
Irvin Moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar
been up since 7:00 -- Irv on the early-morning watch , McFeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour relief
before , they had telephoned the Andrus maid , Selena Masters , and she had arrived early , bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley and confounded Moll
, thanking her for the coffee , had winked and muttered , `` Sure 'nuff , honey ''
the wrong woman for these crudities
hard eye , she informed Moll : `` Don't sure 'nuff me , officer
only to my husband , understand ''
understood
was very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform
was barren of southernisms ; ; she was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized minorities , adopting the rolling R's and constricted vowels of Los Angeles
her dark intelligent face , one would have gauged the voice as that of a Westwood Village matron , ten years out of Iowa
had served the detectives coffee and toast ( they politely declined eggs , uncomfortable about their tenancy ) , she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock market quotations
was thus engaged , McFeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day , any recollections she had of people hanging around , of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen , of strange cars cruising the neighborhood
him precisely , missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports
, Joe realized , was her own woman
the only kind of Negro Laura Andrus would want around : independent , unservile , probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework -- and doubly efficient
parents emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later , the maid greeted them quietly
awful sorry about what's happened '' , Selena said
today'll be a good-news day ''
off to the bedrooms
his coffee into the nursery
night , a phone company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones
have to remain in the office continually
the parents , then studied his notebook
to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file
well ''

not answer him
was bloated with drugging , redder than normal
had the glassy look of an invalid , as if she had not slept at all
-- we managed '' , she said
a little groggy
happen during the night ''
crank calls '' , McFeeley said
couple of tips we're running down -- nothing promising
expect more of the same
your number is in the directory ''
occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had it listed '' , Andrus muttered
on the sofa with his coffee , warming his hands on the cup , although the room was heavy with heat
had little to say to each other
night's horror -- the absolute failure , overcast with the intrusions of the press , had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness , of play-acting
coffee , discussing the weather , the day's shopping , Fritzie's commitments at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news show , even the front page of the Santa Luisa Register , resting on the kitchen bar
ransom ; ; Amy still missing
Andrus walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five-column lead of the article ( by Duane Bosch , staff correspondent -- age not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha national celebrities ''
the parents he would escort them to police headquarters in a half hour
, he wanted to talk to the neighbors
not want to bring the Andruses to the station house too early -- Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference , and he didn't want them subjected to the reporters again
think of nothing else to tell them : no assurances , no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day
detective left , Andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project
was talking to the maid , arranging for her to come in every day , instead of the four days she now worked
only a handful of reporters remained
of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference
to the caravan of the previous night , there were only four cars parked across the street
he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls
not see Sparling , or DeGroot , or Ringel , or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago
the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers
cleaner had not yet been around
the reporters called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant ''
ignored him , skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the Skopas house
was halfway to the door , the proprietor emerged -- a mountainous , dark man , his head thick with resiny black hair , his eyes like two of the black olives he imported in boatloads
himself
of the house , his nourished face unrevealing , consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective
as soon as Mr. Skopas had disclosed -- in a hoarse whisper -- the detective's errand , his family gathered in a huddle , forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of a baroque fireplace
marble urns and alabaster lamps , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait
amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast table ; ; a gross boy in his teens , shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands ; ; a girl in her twenties , fat and sullen , descending the marble staircase ; ; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor
him in monosyllables , nods , occasionally muttering in Greek to one another , awaiting the word from Papa , who restlessly cracked his knuckles , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway
they hadn't seen anyone around ; ; no , they didn't know the Andrus family ; ; yes , they had read about the case ; ; yes , they had let some reporters use their phone , but they would no longer
no opinions , volunteered nothing , betrayed no emotions
, McFeeley could not help make comparison with the Andrus couple
people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy
they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal
was simple : wealth brought them happiness , and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had , let no one in on the secrets
, Fritzie and Laura Andrus were quivering fledglings
no outer fortifications , no hard shells of confidence ; ; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day , let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them
no curiosity over the case , offered no expression of sympathy , made no move to escort McFeely to the door
remained impacted on the sofa until he had left
spoken to Mrs.
previous day
a family named Kahler , owners of a two-story Tudor-style house on the south side of the Andrus home
had not come up in any discussions with Laura , and he had no idea what they would be like
the immaculate lawn and gardens : each blade of grass cropped , bright and firm ; ; each shrub glazed with good health
was answered by a slender man in his sixties -- straight-backed , somewhat clerical in manner , wearing rimless glasses
identified himself , he nodded , unsmiling , and ushered him into a sedate living room
joined them
a dried-out quality -- a gray , lean woman , not unattractive
dressed rather formally
wore a vest and a tie , the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands of pearls
thing '' , Mr. Kahler said , when they were seated , `` when I heard you ringing , I figured it was that guy down the block , Hausman ''
puzzled
: `` I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he's sore , so I expected him to come barging in ''
went on to explain how Hausman's fox terrier had been `` making '' in his flower beds
refused to be scared off , so Kahler had purchased some small firecrackers
lay in wait in the garage , and when the terrier came scratching around , he'd let fly with a cherry bomb
the hell out of him '' , Kahler grinned
hit him in the ass once ''
at the detective
, all I needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life ''
dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room , and then they went across the hall to the kitchen
intimidated by the stove
the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for her
flamed up two inches high
the teakettle
water on to boil and then searched through the icebox
of a loaf of dark bread ; ; butter ; ; jam ; ; a tiny cake of ice
search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver , they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry
was settling the teacart , he went back across the hall to their bedroom , opened one of the suitcases , and took out powdered coffee and sugar
with the teacart and he opened the windows
you want to call Eugene ''
, but it was not really a question , and so he left the room , walked down the hall to the front of the apartment , hesitated , and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study
voice answered
petit dejeuner '' , Harold said , in an accent that did credit to Miss Sloan , his high-school French teacher
same time , his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here , and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody
breakfast-table conversation was impossible , it was at least something that they were able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it , and the plate of bread and butter , and that Eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first
a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water
he said : `` I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today ''
him that they did not expect or need to be entertained
a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water , and then , stirring , he sat back in his chair
creaked
he moved or said something , the chair creaked again
not entirely silent , or openly rude -- unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness
right on creaking under his own considerable weight , and all it needed , Harold thought , was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it
open window they heard sounds below in the street : cartwheels , a tired horse's plodding step , voices
the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in
him and he promptly forgot
the marmalade , the bread , the black-market butter , back and forth
said about hotels or train journeys
Harold his car , to use at any time he cared to , and when this offer was not accepted , the armchair creaked
three had another cup of coffee
in his pajamas and dressing gown , and on his large feet he wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned up at the toes
me '' , he said in Berlitz English , and got up and left them , to bathe and dress
shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall
that he had no idea where the telephone was
moment the bathroom door flew open and Eugene came out , with his face lathered for shaving , and strode down the hall , tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went
was in the study but the ringing came from the hall
telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord , and when the conversation came to an end , Eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment , to his bathroom , where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub
left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them
his head
called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said
wants you and Barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night ''
Harold a key to the front door , and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment
time had elapsed so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten , Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another
room next to theirs was a huge cradle , of mahogany , ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf
the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen
their bathroom , and then a bedroom that , judging by the photographs on the walls , must belong to Mme Cestre
woman who looked like Alix , with her two children
Eugene on their wedding day
in oval frames of Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man who must be Alix's grandfather
, considerably younger and very different

gray-haired man whose glance -- direct , lifelike , and mildly accusing -- was contradicted by the gilt and black frame
the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person
, could it be
metal shutters closed , the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there
the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas , which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet
were of the same material , and there were some big oil paintings -- portraits in the style of Lancret and Boucher
taken individually , the big rooms were , or seemed to be , square , the apartment as a whole formed a triangle
, the study where Eugene slept , was light and bright and airy and cheerful
looked out on the Place Redoute -- it was the only window of the apartment that did
slowly , he saw a marble fireplace , a desk , a low bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes in the doors
Eugene had slept in , made up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows
record player with a pile of classical records beside it
was the one on top
could not be Eugene's passion
the records were dusty
the doors of the bookcase

he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires : works on theology , astral physics , history , biology , political science


over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything
on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room
called out to them as they were passing through the foyer
were on the right as you walked into the building , and her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture -- a big , round , oak dining table and chairs , a buffet , with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame
had come while they were out , and had been put in their room , the concierge said
until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do ''
the Vouillemont , I guess ''
guess ''
sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing
to the Flea Market , expecting to find the treasures of Europe , and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in Tours
and junk of every sort , as far as the eye could see
, even so
everything
some cotton aprons , and Harold bought shoestrings
lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad , busy , unpicturesque streets , and coming home they got lost in the Metro ; ; it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed , in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute
the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole
opened the door , there stood Eugene , on his way out of the apartment
wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt , and in his hand he carried a little black bag
not explain where he was going , and they did not ask
they went on down the hall to their room
you think he could be having an affair ''
, as they heard the front door close
no '' , Harold said , shocked
, this is France , after all ''
know , but there must be some other explanation
spending the evening with friends ''
for that he needs a little bag ''
shopping in the neighborhood , and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given in Blois , and some cheese , and a dozen eggs , and a bag of oranges from a peddler in the Place Redoute -- the first oranges they had seen since they landed
Vermouth , sitting in front of a cafe
got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment , and thought how , under different circumstances , they might have stayed on here , in these old-fashioned , high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the Irelands' apartment in the East Eighties
have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days
down the hall to Eugene's bathroom , to turn on the hot-water heater , and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks
them
damp
out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub

around the room and then called out : `` Come here , quick ''
is it ''
, standing in the doorway
solved the mystery of the little bag
is and there is what was in it
do people go swimming in Paris
in the river , maybe ''
boat ''
a big boat anchored near the Place De La Concorde , with a swimming pool in it -- didn't you notice it
he has time to go swimming , he had time to be with us ''
at him in surprise
know '' , he said , reading her mind
don't know what I'm going to do with you ''
because we are in France '' , he said , `` and know so few people
like this matters more than it would at home
he was so nice when he was nice ''
because I didn't feel like dancing ''
don't think it was that , really ''
what was it ''
don't know
I did
coat , maybe
about Eugene is that he's very proud ''
thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be
-- what about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment they would ever have together , their one chance of knowing each other
the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields
any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything
with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes , of about a hundred pounds' weight
Jesus's body , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices ; ; that is how the Jews prepare a body for burial
present at the Descent were Mary , Mary's sister , Mary Magdalene , John , Joseph of Arimathea , Nicodemus
he might , he could find no place where the Bible spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus
scene was crowded with mourners , such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna , where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped Mary's last poignant moment
concept there could be no one else present
desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe
Mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap
the soldiers had laid him on the ground , while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate's asking for Christ's body , Nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes , and the others had gone home to mourn
saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses
feel what Mary was undergoing
be no halos , no angels
be two human beings , whom God had chosen
close to Mary , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey
was intensely alive , anguished ; ; her son was dead
he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment dead indeed , the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross
sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt for his mother ; ; only what Mary felt for her son
body would be passive , his eyes closed
have to carry the human communication
right to him
a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems
Christ was to be life size , how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly
would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion , yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child
only one way to accomplish this : by design , by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept
by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper
these approximated what he was feeling within himself
same time he started walking the streets , peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls , storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like , how they moved
he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns , with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads , remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper
draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds
as he went along , completing a life-size clay figure , then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper , wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento brought from the bank of the Tiber , to the consistency of thick mud
could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ's body , to intensify her inner turmoil
cloth dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments had to be made
that's sculpture '' , commented Argiento wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor for a week , `` making mud pies ''

, Argiento , if you control the way these folds are bunched , like this , or made to flow , you can enrich the body attitudes
have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone ''
into the Jewish quarter , wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how Christ might have looked
section was in Trastevere , near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa
had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews into Rome
for the most part , they were well treated , as a `` reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity '' ; ; many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican as physicians , musicians , bankers
did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose
told to ask for Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon
the rabbi in the room of study , a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes , robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head
reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his congregation
explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi replied gravely : `` The Bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images
why our creative people give their time to literature , not to painting or sculpture ''
, Rabbi Melzi , you don't object to others creating works of art ''
at all
has its own tenets ''
am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble
to make Jesus an authentic Jew
accomplish this if you will not help me ''
said thoughtfully , `` I would not want my people to get in trouble with the Church ''
am working for the Cardinal of San Dionigi
he would approve ''
kind of models would you prefer ''

mid-thirties
laborers , but sinewy men

''
smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes
me your address
send you the best the quarter has to offer ''
to Sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches , asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated Madonna
the drawings and improvised a trestle couch
some scrap lumber
and Argiento built the stand , covering it with blankets
model arrived at dusk
for a moment when Michelangelo asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins , led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes
draped him over the rough stand , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother's lap
quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; ; only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting
the end of the sitting , when Michelangelo showed him the quick , free drawings , with the mother roughed in , holding her son , the model grasped what Michelangelo was after , and promised to speak to his friends
for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi
quite a different problem
sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry
of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother
introduced him into several Roman homes
sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk , young girls not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year or two
Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men , he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy ; ; but he had sketched the women of Tuscany in their fields and homes
able to discern the body lines of the Roman women under their robes
concentrated weeks putting his two figures together : a Mary who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap ; ; and a Jesus who , though lean , was strong even in death a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito
toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory , without need to consult his sketches
was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay
would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms
wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity , he added or subtracted clay
turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence
each of these approach techniques , and kept them in character : his quill drawings had a scratchiness , suggesting skin texture ; ; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh , as in an abdomen , in a reclining torso ; ; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull
never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind ; ; they remained rough starting points
he was charged with spontaneous energy ; ; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model
surge had to be inside the marble itself
models were his thinking
action

with Argiento was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice
been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable to change his habits : up before dawn to scrub the floors , whether they were dirty or not ; ; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day , the pots scoured with river sand after each meal
, this is senseless '' , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors , particularly in cold weather
too clean
studio once a week
''
'' , said Argiento stolidly
day

taught ''
God help anyone who tries to unteach you ''
; ; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about , for Argiento made few demands on him
was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into Rome
he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses
thing he missed from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals ; ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing : `` Today I go see the horses ''
a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him
crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim , when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil
into the house , eyes burning like fire
him lie down on the bed , brought a pan of hot water , dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter
pain was considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned
he could blink the splinter out
would not come
left his side , keeping the water boiled , applying hot compresses throughout the night
second day Michelangelo began to worry ; ; and by the second night he was in a state of panic : he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye
Argiento went to Jacopo Galli
with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi
carried a cage of live pigeons
Argiento to take a bird out of the cage , cut a large vein under its wing , let the blood gush into Michelangelo's injured eye
came back at dusk , cut the vein of a second pigeon , again washed out the eye
very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps
legs twitched convulsively once , then Kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound
flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands
was gone
awoke , Kate was still rocking the dead child , still crooning in disbelief , `` No , no , oh , no
put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister
beside Kate's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him
told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously
the neighbors came , but Mrs. Tussle came , called by tragedy
always comes in threes '' , she sighed heavily
never comes but in threes ''
the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot
through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment
not accept the death of such a little child
called her to Him '' , the minister had said
not do that , Kate thought stubbornly
came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself
panic of grief she accepted Jonathan's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God
Jonathan's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed
nothing left but her duty to his land and his son
and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom
Mrs. Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried
returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty
herself daily to do what must be done
even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs in the nurse's room off the empty nursery , although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of the baby's death
about the place , wearing a haunted , brooding look , which Kate attributed to the baby's death , until the day a letter came for her addressed to `` Miss Juanita Fitzroy '' , bearing a Grafton postmark
slanting hand , Kate knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel
forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving to take all the mountains
to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended , at what involvement existed for Juanita
and Joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty , for more of the slaves , including Annie , had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp
like a field hand in the afternoons after school
been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry
she had deserted the boy in her own loss
him and missed his company
had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own
was Kate could not fathom
to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies , but Kate had not smelled brandy on him since Mrs. Lattimer's funeral
what he was about , however
gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning
this old fox '' , chuckled Uncle Randolph
knows I'm just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink
to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure ''
still , my foot '' , said Joel
back there riding with the guerrillas , the Moccasin Rangers ''
'' , said Uncle Randolph , smiling , `` or I'll give you another black eye ''
the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at the crossroads some days back
no idea what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night , had heard horsemen on the River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn
Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing `` Old Dan Tucker '' at the top of his voice
voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold sober
was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by General McClellan , threatening reprisals against Rebel guerrillas
taken up in worry for the reckless old man
more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work
taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom
walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident , had seen Joel's burning humiliation before Miss Snow's cold , bespectacled wrath
the hardest pains of growing before him now , as he approached twelve
be his hardest years , she knew , and he missed his father desperately
to find some way to draw him out , to help him
found time , she went blackberry picking with him , and they would come home together , mouths purple , arms and faces scratched , tired enough to forget grief for another day
the new colts Beau had sired
Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer's purple dusk
went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph
in their own world on the bluff , waiting for letters and the peddler , bringing the news
grimly of the destruction of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it ; ; of their first engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack's First Brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the B & O Railroad
were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson wished
came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in Wheeling , Which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors
gaudy trinkets before them , he told of the Rebel losses in the mountains , at Cheat and Rich mountains both , and the Federal march on Beverly
all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did
never git over inter loyal western Virginia , them traitors
is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too '' , he crowed
had gone , Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly , `` Would you take their oath ''
old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said , `` Hell , yes
I've taken it about fifty times already ''
Joel's look of shock
wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate's baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with the South `` And , dear Kate '' , she wrote , `` poor Dr. Breckenridge's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South , to his good father's sorrow
of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the U.S. Army
of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral , John Hunt Morgan is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen factory ''
a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley
garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg for the news
dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight '' , the old man told them
next few days they had cause to rejoice
been a big battle , and the Confederate forces had won
Ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing
Mrs. Tussle waited for letters anxiously
to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate
hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful
prayed now that the North would realize that peace must come , for Virginia had defended her land victoriously
after Manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest when she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window
already lost most of their corn , she thought
to be insulted again because of the South's great victory
McClellan's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs
landing she saw Juanita , her face flushed pink with excitement , run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door
just inside the open door , her hand to her mouth
came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed in the doorway , his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore
him gravely , uneasy with misgivings at his visit
brings you here again , Colonel Marsh ''
, taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun
stopped to say goodbye , Mrs. Lattimer , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby
our doctor could have saved her ''
was a terrible loss to me '' , said Kate quietly , feeling the pain twist again at the mention , knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at Grafton
will you go now that you're leaving Parkersburg ''
him , seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak
you know , General McClellan has been occupying Beverly
notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac
to go to Washington to serve with him ''
are you to leave ''
, watching them both now anxiously
betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly

permit Juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell , Mrs. Lattimer ''
here in the parlor where it's cool '' , she said , trying to be calm
be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and Mrs. Tussle not to see them
back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations
took iced lemonade to Marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden
called to his aide and the pair rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue , Juanita was shaken and trying not to cry
Kate out upstairs , her lips trembling
wants me to go with him tomorrow '' , she told Kate
do you want to do ''
, uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma
could go with him
me as your niece , which , of course , I am
am a slave
me
decision '' , said Juanita , holding her face very still , trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly
, the decision is yours
held your papers of manumission since I married Mr. Lattimer ''
glow from the cove had died out of the sky
in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years , and they needed to say no more
left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows
out the remaining candles with a long snuffer , and in the smell of scented candlewick , the comforting awareness of each other's bodies , the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered , their minds grew numb and then empty of images
-- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table
ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows
a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky
, old , slow , careful of foot , came down the great staircase , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk , her jeweled shoe buckles held forward
, I'm here at last '' , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls
don't hear the music
getting deaf , I must admit it ''
to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it
is everyone
, where is everyone
you lummox , you've forgot to order the musicians ''
there , a large old woman , smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning , this big foolish baby of a son
times now , like this , when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations
a birthday ball
had reached his majority at eighteen
it her own first ball as mistress of this big house , a Van Rensselaer bride from way upstate near Albany , from Rensselaerwyck
handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom
up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom
was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh
ridden hard from Boston , and he was not used to horseback
driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler , he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move
leading south along the river was shaded with old trees , and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood memories
the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on
cross to Manhattan , to Harlem Heights , before morning
certain farmhouse was a station for the Sons of Liberty
send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news
would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads and horses' sore haunches , of colonial wars
everything here fitted back into his life , even if he had been away so long
Sir Francis , the valley society , the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks , and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road
was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace
was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads
for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet
out one of them and cocked it
wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes
a grotesque hen , five or six feet tall
the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers
, this apocalyptic beast , on two thin legs , and its wings -- were they feathered arms
as it ran
was bloody
of skin hung from it
shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils
a firm hand with it
in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear
bird thing ran away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster
was gone
on , wary and shaken
were out tonight
New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island
thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights
it looked across at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses , estates , and big farms of the original ( non-Indian ) landowners began
east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound
western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights
a view over Manhattan and the harbor
of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights , and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields
bounded by snake-rail fences , and there were grazing cattle
shores north and south , the fishers and mooncursers -- smugglers -- lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier of sand , Fire Island
hawk , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item , kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay , sheltered by the Jersey inlets
threw tidbits overboard
ships were near Paulus Hook , already being called , by a few , Jersey City
the ships of His Majesty's Navy , herding the hulks of the East Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists
of battle on Breed's Hill had already seeped through , and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress
hawk , his wings not moving , circled and glided lower
sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him , the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black , the bronze cannon at the ports
gig of H.M.S. Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S. Neptune
`` the freed slaves to despotism '' -- the town dwellers -- watched the ships and waited
de frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in
bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; ; their rock paths led down to the Hudson
the open bay facing Manhattan was Staten Island , gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms , cattle barns , and berry thickets
Creek in Dutchess County , past the white church at Fishkill , past Verplanck's Point on the east bank of the Hudson , to the white salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen
tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year The fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight
ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London
more ships , more lobster-backed infantry , and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion
, having slept away a day and a night , came awake in a plank farmhouse on the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil
out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King's Bridge toward Westchester
seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual ; ; a carriage raising up the choking June dust , and beyond , in a meadow , a local militia company drilling with muskets , Kentuck' rifles , every kind of horse pistol , old sword , or cutlass
events of the last few days flooded David's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston
introspective , he ached
sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept
was more to do
written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government
his mosquito-plagued neck
saddlebags , hung on a Hitchcock chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John Hunter
tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap , and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt , its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost
he was free of self-deception
was , suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories
be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war
had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface
that many were using it for their own ends
did not matter
the razor slowly ; ; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was being born
men did not want it he could understand
aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers
, like Morris Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas
would test us all , he decided
ingratitude would occur
John Hancock would do well now ; ; war was a smugglers' heaven
of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler's
that would increase rather than be done away with
to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing
with John Hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream
a short play of tenebrous shadows
to shave with great sweeping strokes
an essential part in our mortality , and suddenly for no reason he could imagine ( or admit ) the image of Peg laughing filled his mind -- so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuances of pleasure and joy
sensual patterns off , carefully shaving his long upper lip
harder , he muttered , to meditate on man ( or woman ) than on God
shaving , washed his face clean of lather , and combed and retied his hair
proud that he had never worn a wig
more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder
cheerful again , refreshed ; ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit , the well-made riding boots
so easy to falsify sentiment
meadow below , militia officers shouted at their men and on King's Bridge two boys sat fishing
would happen ; ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much
could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days
to pack the saddlebags
this too shall pass away : it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy -- yes , in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley , where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires
men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way , almost unchanged from feudal times
Andrei
how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish
a Bathyran meeting long ago
had returned from the colonies in Palestine and , before the national leadership , exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert
drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched
that his own reaction had been one of indifference
found the meaning too late
him
of the Lublin Uplands was rich , but no one seemed to care
unfertile land in Palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink
sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists
them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches
Brandel rose to speak , the hall became silent
do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism
here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest , seeking human dignity
forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea
our singular goal
travel through the forest is for each man's conscience
end our journey is always the same
seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion ''
how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism
sounded good to Andrei , but he did not believe it
heart he had no desire to go to Palestine
the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright
went into battle Andrei had told Alex , `` I only want to be a Pole
my city , not Tel Aviv ''
Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief

the smug eyes of the Home Army chief , Roman , and all the Romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him
let this black hole of death in Warsaw's heart exist without a cry of protest
had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they flirted from behind their fans


Rak
a Jew ''
day , week by week , month by month , the betrayal gnawed at Andrei's heart
his teeth together
Warsaw , he said to himself
Poland and all the goddamned mothers' sons of them
Poland is a coffin
vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind
now
beyond this fog
, and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe
afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front
siding , another train which was a familiar sight these days


eye sized them up
not Poles
by their appearance that they were Rumanians
toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with Styka
the places in Poland , Andrei hated Lublin the most
were all gone
the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto
moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point
Ana watched it carefully
was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere
1939 , Odilo Globocnik , the Gauleiter of Vienna , established SS headquarters for all of Poland
ran a check on Globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian administrators
the Death's-Head Corps
the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem
messages from Himmler , Heydrich , and Eichmann came in through Alfred Funk , Lublin's fountainhead spouted
of interlacing lagers , work camps , concentration camps erupted in the area
Jewish prisoners of war disappeared into Lublin's web
in and out of Lublin , indicating German confusion
of a massive reservation in the Uplands to hold several million Jews A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to the island of Madagascar Stories of the depravity of the guards at Globocnik's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names
, Sobibor , Chelmno , Poltawa , Belzec , Krzywy-Rog , Budzyn , Krasnik
, electric shocks , lashings , wild dogs , testicle crushers
Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken , dope-ridden maniacs
their heart
spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin
, a miniature of Warsaw's , was emptied into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek
camp emptied , it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around Lublin , then by deportees from outside Poland
in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek , but they never left , and Majdanek was not growing any larger
happening in Majdanek
Reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw
another Majdanek in the Warsaw area , as they suspected
at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings
told him he was still early
boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall
an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him
was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries
Androfski ''
up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached , homely face of Sergeant Styka
beside him and pumped his hand excitedly
have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn
you might get in on a morning train ''
good to see you again , Styka ''
his captain
broke into tears
, Andrei Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer
was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby
to call me Jan '' , Andrei said
and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously
that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war ''
lucky that you were still living in Lublin ''
about fate
a time I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces , but one thing led to another
a girl in trouble and we had to get married
bad girl
have three children and responsibilities
at the granary
the old days in the army , but I get by

I tried to reach you , but I never knew how
to Warsaw twice , but there was that damned ghetto wall '' `` I understand ''
his nose again
you able to make the arrangements ''

is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek
exactly as instructed
him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in London ''
answer ''
thousand zlotys ''
he be trusted ''
is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours if he betrays you ''
man , Styka ''
Jan must you go inside Majdanek
Everyone really knows what is happening there ''
everyone , Styka ''
good will it really do ''
don't know
there is a shred of conscience left in the human race
they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation ''
you really believe that , Jan ''
have to believe it ''
his head slowly
am only a simple soldier
think things out too well
was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about Jews
you when I first came in
captain might have been a Jew , but he wasn't a Jew
mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys
sir
of our company had a dozen fights defending your name
knew about it , but by God , we taught them respect for Captain Androfski ''

the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years

can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see ''
we are neither blind nor insane
of your company would not allow your name dishonored
we let the Germans do this ''
have sat many hours with this , Styka
ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country
faith , Styka
to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our battle for equality
I think I hate it very much ''
do you really think that the world outside Poland will care any more than we do ''
frightened Andrei
don't go inside Majdanek ''
still a soldier in a very small way , Styka ''
an answer that Styka understood
was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center
in a sweat-saturated undershirt , cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown
a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken Polish features
around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread
it dripped down his chin
it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch
''

at the pair of them
a sort of `` yes '' answer
cousin works at the Labor Bureau
make you work papers
take a few days
get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew
know if I can get you into the inner camp
, maybe no , but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building ''
his way to the bottom of the soup bowl
understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place ''
from the Home Army ''

but Jews ''

get strange orders ''
-- what about the money ''
off five one-thousand-zloty notes
never seen so much money
flat fingers , petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying , snatched the bills clumsily
ain't enough ''
get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek ''
ain't taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business ''
Styka were silent
getting real dramatic
been more impressed if I hadn't remembered that she'd played Hedda Gabler in her highschool dramatics course
want her back on that broken record
free in the whole goddam world '' , was all I could think of to say
delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink
am '' , she said
all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma's fifty dollars I was spending
just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch
sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me
crazy about her all over again
the call of the wild all right
turned out to be hell like all the others
down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill
the same old routine
to dancing , just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men , but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together and there I was back on the hook
have the decency to call up Thelma and tell her I'd met old friends and would be home late
could scratch her eyes out '' , Eileen cried and stamped her foot when I came back from the phone booth
know I don't like my men to have other women
it
it ''
so drunk I had to take her home
a walk up on Hudson Street
about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go
a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table
smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use
about Ballestre ''
to shake her to make her listen

him ''
was very mysterious and dramatic
and I allow each other absolute freedom
above being jealous
to me bringing home strange men
tell him you're my husband
object to that ''
I object
pokes his nose in here I'll slug him ''
really would be funny ''
to laugh
still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed
I'm made of flesh and blood
a plaster saint
was horrible
my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife
had hangovers
she couldn't lift her head from the pillow
under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot
stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell
somebody else in the apartment

could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight
around with the percolator in my hand
were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora
, eyebrow mustache
without an expression in the world
have time to speak before Eileen's voice was screeching at us from the bed
Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier Bowman
exhusband ''
the nastiest laugh I ever heard
don't either of you forget that I'm not any man's property
want to fight , go down on the sidewalk ''
enjoying the situation

a psychologist all right
wanting to sock the poor bastard I found myself having a fellowfeeling for him
felt the same way
felt such a lowdown hound in my life
I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers
face Thelma after that night
even have the nerve to call her on the telephone
her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express
I had to give her Eileen's address , but she never came near us
did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever
said a word about the fifty dollars
a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking
know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times
learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband away
me with Thelma
to squeeze all the drama out of a situation
I was shacked up with Eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street
the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship
it and it ate on me all the time , but I didn't know how right I was till later
did know was that Precious was always around
in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs
do you think pays the rent
have me throw the poor boy out on the street '' , Eileen said when I needled her about it
sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention
a wonderful way of not listening to things she didn't want to hear
didn't think she was twotiming me with Precious right then
on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night
me worried
make out what his racket was
him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be
smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner
let Eileen treat him like a valet
place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious who did the work
could find out what his business was
seemed to have money in his pocket
had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger
then he would disappear for several days
'' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading questions
he's just an international spy '' , Eileen would shout with her screechy laugh
he can't have been too happy either
no relief from drink because , though sometimes Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening , he'd leave it on the table untouched
was in liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess
I pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his
day '' , I told Eileen , `` that guy will kill us both ''
wouldn't listen
every night was the only way I could handle the situation
to feel the same way
had that much in common
was drinking cost money
Eileen and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening
have wheedled a little out of Precious
some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from my respectable uptown life , but when that was gone I didn't have a cent
know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer hadn't come to town
looked like a heavier Jim
the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have Jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm
a big thick beefy violent man
may have been a lecher and a plugugly , but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little sister
had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything
Eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again
God hath joined '' etcetera
were real religious people except for Kate
would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief
been worried as hell ever since she'd lost her job on that fashion magazine
gone big with the Hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of Art And Apparel
me trying to help her get her job back
Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion
about blew us both out of the water when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with
brother I can't take a job right now '' , she said with her eyes on her ice cream , `` I'm going to have a baby , Francis Xavier's baby , my own husband's baby ''
thought was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks
was bubbling over with sentiment
that ever happened
really would have to settle down to love honor and obey , and she'd have to quit drinking
East for the christening , by God he would
separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into Eileen's hand to help towards a layette
left town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job
contacts all over the labor movement
of Pat's named Frank Sposato had just muscled into the Portwatchers' Union
were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves
them were elderly men
responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of New York
as well paid as they should have been
the portwatchers let Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen
a front , some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the Redhook local
was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement
radicalism was a recommendation
wait to get me hired
gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked the honest working stiff
a man will do for a woman
one fact which Rector could not overlook , one truth which he could not deny
as there were two human beings working together on the same project , there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave
how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual
the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord's servants
only natural that Fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions
himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church -- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel
not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego , demanding to be satisfied , for the two were intertwined and could not be separated
desperately to see Kayabashi defeated , the Communists in the village rooted out , the mission standing triumphant , for in the triumph of the Lord he himself would be triumphant , too
this was a part of the eternal plan , that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving , indefatigable force for good in the world

it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice
have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed
move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days
had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop , using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse
event Rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what Kayabashi was planning
elated at the prospect
allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor -- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy
with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday , nodding attentively as Rector gave him his final instructions
to get involved in no arguments ; ; he was to try to make no converts ; ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard
a ridiculous situation and Rector knew it , for Hino , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent
wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection
of his experience in the mission field Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino
moment that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job , any job -- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand -- he had been ready to become a Christian
already been studying the Bible ; ; he knew the fundamentals , and after studying with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that
never been able to find out much about Hino's past
very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject
pieces of this mosaic together , Rector had the vague outlines of a biography
the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast , in Chiba , and divided his life between the land and the sea , supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat
Hino's brothers turned to either one or both of their father's occupations , but Hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller
gone into the Japanese navy , had been trained as an officer , had participated in one or two battles -- he never went into detail regarding his military experience -- and at the age of twenty-five , quite as a bolt out of the blue , he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a Christian
often curious ; ; often tempted to ask questions but he never did
when Hino decided to tell him about his experiences , he would do so unasked
no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation
telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector's office rarely rang unless it was important
surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other end of the line
even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted
was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission
never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it
''

guess it will be all right
the oyabun like to bring his guests up here ''
afternoon '' , the secretary said
three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time ''
right '' , Rector said
will be expecting them ''
about to hang up the phone , but a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation open
something more to say
beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers '' , he said
despite himself
the oyabun has been working on it '' , he said , then checked himself and added : `` You can tell Kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use ''
gosaimasu ''
sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector's hand
no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission
oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence , and from all the available information it was probably the latter
feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this , a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village
same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity
Kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived
had given the call a few moments thought , he went into the kitchen to ask Mrs. Yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors , using the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission , then he went outside to inspect the grounds
a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn
him to move it for the time being ; ; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless
initial impression would be important now
into the print shop , where Fletcher had just finished cleaning the press
many pamphlets do we have in stock ''

should say about a hundred thousand '' , Fletcher said
''
would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon '' , Rector said , He explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create , the picture of a very busy mission
not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly , just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner
as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things Rector requested
stop was at the schoolroom , where Mavis was monitoring a test
to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside
her of the visitors and then of his plans
many children do you have present today ''

back toward the schoolroom
'' , she said
, only fourteen
Ito girl had had to go home
a pretty bad cold ''
would like them to appear very busy today , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full of life
to create the impression of a compound full of children
think you can manage it ''

try ''
was walking back toward the residential hall , Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him
in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits , but he was still a little wary around Rector for they had not yet discussed the incident
think I've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time '' , he said
adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low
Fine '' , Rector said
out over the expanse of the compound
going to take a lot of activity to fill it
you ever operated a transit ''

, sir '' , Johnson said
are about to become a first-class surveyor '' , Rector said
Konishi gets back with the jeep , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys
help you
an old transit in the basement
is out of it , but that won't matter
pretty efficient and that's the important thing ''
on to explain what he had in mind

he could do it
warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall
rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much
not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it
not going to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise
Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall , and then to take charge of the office while the party was here
had been done , Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock
thirty he sent Fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of Kayabashi's party
, attired in his best blue serge suit , sat in a chair out on the lawn , in the shade of a tree , smoking a cigarette and waiting
was cooler here , and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass , an effect which he found pleasant
by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient
took the bait
that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger , but -- joy of joys , he would be at home at the hour mentioned
she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement
told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed
bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose
again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme of love , she asked for help in the matter of her career
act and she could write
was concerned in the management of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities there , would he read and criticize her novel
he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal : Have you any objection to the following plan
evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles
shall be free and unknown ; ; we can return the following morning She concluded by asking for a brief interview -- `` to settle with you where '' -- and she threw in a tribute to his `` gentle manners '' and `` the wild originality of your countenance ''
his reply with trembling fingers he agreed
would see her that evening
last
meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' -- he would attend to that
one of the new forte-pianos in the room and , as Claire rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song before she left
him Scott's charming ballad `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue of the moment
never sung better
voice is delightful '' , he approved with a warm smile
will be a new experience -- I have never before made love to a nightingale
been cooing doves , chattering magpies , thieving jackdaws , a proud peacock , a silly goose , and a harpy eagle -- whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals ''
they went , he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham Abbey , scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire Club
Claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington , one of the leaders of the so-called `` Order ''
the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation
danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities
amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish
all that belonged to the age of `` Devil Dashwood '' and `` Wicked Wilkes '' , abbot and beadsman of the Order
seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison
close by the turn to Bishopsgate
half mile away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace , the air about them scented with stock , and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden
peaceful -- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure
the fabulous Byron
women had longed for the privilege that was hers
she to behave , Claire wondered
passive , to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd
the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem
her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience , satiety might well be an equal handicap
she would not pretend modesty , but neither must she be crudely bold
that was the thing
bedroom she would insist on darkness
club foot he might well be grateful
inn , which was situated close to a broad weir , Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as `` milord ''
was evidently a familiar haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown
in the sitting room was lighted
about the bedroom ''

to me last time I was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell ''
found some owls had built a nest in the chimney , milord , but I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again ''
not only had he been here before , but it seemed he might well come again
suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan
supper was ordered and a bottle of port
ship had borne him to Elba , French wines had started to cross the Channel , the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula still ruled
waited for supper they sat by the fire , glasses in hand , while Byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers
is overpriced '' , he said
great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate , not man against man for the prize of a woman's body
see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance ''
gods seemed to think sex pretty important '' , she rebutted
and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron and the nymph of the owl's nest
be Minerva , I suppose
owl her symbol ''

you know something of the classics , do you ''
me about Minerva , how she behaved , what she did to please you ''
tell you nothing
ask you who 'tis you're being unfaithful to , husband or lover
I don't care ''
moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity , who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind
well '' , she said , `` I'll not catechize you
the others so long as I have my place in history ''
striking the right note
ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery could hardly seem overdone
beauty , high position in both the social and intellectual worlds , athlete , fabled lover -- if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his
supper over , Claire went to him and , slipping an arm about his shoulder , sat on his knee
her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his
, moist and parted , spoke his name
''
went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown ; ; then , to better purpose , he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers , untied it
beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips from hers , he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child
kindled by his kiss , his caressing hand , her desire was aflame
up and went swiftly to the bedroom
poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color
slowly with due appreciation
an excellent vintage
and went to the bedroom
the doorway he said : `` The form of the human female , unlike her mind and her spirit , is the most challenging loveliness in all nature ''
returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron's mistress
coincidence , on the evening of her return Shelley chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet's successes
declaimed the sonorous measures , it was as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings
it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley as he closed the book , `` it is still poetry of a high order ''
he would only leave the East '' , said Mary
am tired of sultans and scimitars ''
hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte '' , said Claire , with slightly overdone carelessness
do you know that ''

was told it on good authority '' , Claire answered darkly
mustn't tell , I mustn't tell '' , she repeated to herself
promised him I wouldn't ''
winter came , and with it Mary's baby -- a boy as she had wished
he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor
pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter : `` Fanny and Mrs. Godwin will probably be glad to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement , and that her child is well ''
same time another child -- this one of Shelley's brain -- was given to the world : Alastor , a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind's musings
published only to be savagely attacked , contemptuously ignored
a copy to Southey , a former friend , and another to Godwin
the gift
praise sustained him in his disappointment
completely
thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation
have made the labor worth while '' , he said to her , smiling
in the future , since I write for a public of one , I can save the poor publishers from wasting their money ''
public of one '' , Mary echoed reprovingly
can you say such a thing
be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of Alastor
some even now
that dear , clever Mr. Thynne
sure he is in raptures ''
Mr. Thynne , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement ''
are other Mr. Thynnes
is bewitched by Byron's caliphs and harem beauties ''
attitude toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute
resentful of his easy success as compared with Shelley's failure
month that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand copies of The Siege Of Corinth , a slovenly bit of Byronism that even Shelley's generosity rebelled at
poet was at low-water mark
writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent
sides doors were being slammed in his face
scandals , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity
under the impact of his wife's disclosures , he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender might be
defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin
moment there was no woman in his life , and it was this vacuum that had given Claire her opportunity
liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing
since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace
to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor , claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes
the pass to the colonel
thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order , but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel's belt
yearning , the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines
remain in the tent , waiting impatiently , occupied by some trivial task


me the copies of everything B and C companies have requisitioned in the last six months
last six months , sir
heard me
lot of waste going on here
to stop
to take a look
no damned holiday , Beckworth

, sir
the tent
could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank
back
crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs , methodically tearing at his thumbnail
was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth
some fifty paces from the edge of the bank
outside , it seemed no more than a low drumlin , a lump on the dark earth
ladder ran down to a wooden floor
enabled observers to watch across the river
smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth , rotting wood and urine
floor was slimed beneath Watson's boots
the Union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle
no place to sit , but Watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams
corner was the soldier with the white flag
stiffly erect , clutching the staff , his body half hidden by the limp cloth
looked at him
had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant , brandishing the flag of truce
hauled him over the side , and he had remained silent while they crossed
with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank
in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy
boat had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers
presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof
had told him that both lists must be checked
given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass
, surprised , said he would have to see
nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later
peered through the darkness at the rampart
he would take back across the river stood there , but he turned away from them
no part of the emotions of the exchange , no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt
hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him
carefully ignored the man , he could not deny his presence
would be better to speak to him , since silence could not exorcise his form
briefly at him , seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner
won't be too long
pass is approved , I may be a half hour
answered in a curious , muffled voice , his lips barely moving
away and did not see the man's knees buckle and his body sag
, sir
acknowledged the man
easier to think now , Watson decided
figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts
slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor
to order the words of the three Union officers , seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy
groped blindly
of success steadily eroded his interest
pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift
of futility , an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known , seeped through him
the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river
he crossed the dark water , to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole
annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion
conscious of a growing sense of absurdity
written it all out , hadn't he
report official enough
he hope to accomplish here
ordered him not to leave the far bank
a guilty urge , he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected

John something he would find out for himself
in the corner belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption
and then laughed aloud

voice was muffled again , stricken with chagrin
the staff , and his dark eyes blinked apologetically
me , sir
get out of here
up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds
left , the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank
boat swung slowly to the pull of the current
held the end of a frayed rope
guards appeared , carrying their rifles at ready
at them curiously
stocky men , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms and sturdy boots
shambled a long column of weak , tattered men
gray figures raised a hoarse , cawing cry like the call of a bird flock
toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness , elbowing and shoving
were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise
down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats
soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs
men tried to rise and fell again
moved to them
two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly
confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff
crawling man forced himself erect
like a drunkard , his arms milling in slow circles
forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head tilted oddly
were short and stiff , and , with his head thrown back , his progress was a supercilious strut
to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom
into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge , his weight nearly swamping the craft
for the fourth man
reached the three passive guards ; ; he crept in an incertain manner , patting the ground before him
did not look at him
on the earth halted , seemingly bewildered
back on his thin haunches like a weary hound
began to crawl again
the creeping figure
a spectator interest
man make it or not
there was a clock for him to crawl against
failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud
minutes to make it sporting
guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow-scrambling man
halted , and Watson gasped
began to creep in the wrong direction , deceived by a slight rise in the ground
slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart
for him , his boots slamming the soft earth
came to life with astonishing menace
and flung their rifles up
wildly
dropped to his knee for better aim
me help him , for the love of God
lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson with sullen , puzzled faces
to the crawling man and stopped , panting heavily
down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm
clutch , a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone
awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet
into a cadaverous face
balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids
of fingers , the tips gummy with dark earth , patted at Watson's throat
voice was a sweet , patient whisper
said that he'd take my arm and get me right there
ain't Henry

don't matter
far
could it be , Watson thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl
length or all the rest of his nighted life
far
talk deep
us fellas
the voice , bein in camp


, now
walk
, course I can
walk real good
down the bank
leaned his frail body against Watson's shoulder
no heavier than a child
for breath
wheezed weakly , his fetid breath beating softly against Watson's neck
whisper came after great effort
, Christ
you was Henry
to take me

there
the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff
swayed on a thwart , turning his ruined eyes from side to side
away , sickened for the first time in many months
the patient voice calling

you , Henry
him lie down
a deep breath
not meant to shout
with his back to the skiff
mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away
bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches
you
you do to them
at him accusingly
angry , sickened
not felt that during the afternoon
nor later
emotions had been inward , self-conscious
, on a night like this , it was only the outward emotions that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others

it
sure of it
of man allowed this sort of thing to happen
fool he had been to think of his brother
was dead
it matter
had been crossed off a list
cool body lay in the ground
had any meaning
he thought of , to go to John , grovel and beg understanding
with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go
slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute
him think John had a right to witness his brother's humiliation
had John to any special consideration
better , more deserving
with John
chafe with impatience to see Charles , rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in Hillman's beautiful , schoolmaster's hand
curse
that brave boys didn't cry
on the ground
grimly satisfied
stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother's pain
knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering
not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , `` O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps ''
say , I wouldn't want to begin a day like this , but I often wonder what the dead would have done
shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge
see it from this window where I write
built by the Pasterns , and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property
under a veil of thin , new grass , like some embarrassing fact of physicalness , and I think Mrs. Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning
have been like her
a pale woman
her terrace , sitting in her parlor , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem
a cup of tea and she would say , `` Why , these cups look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year ''
the new swimming pool and she would say , slapping her ankle , `` I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes ''
a chair and she would say , `` Why , it's a nice imitation of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy ''
were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights were long , her children ungrateful , and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare
ago , she would have been known as a golf widow , and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement
wore weeds , and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that Mr. Pastern was dead , but Mr. Pastern was far from dead
marching up and down the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting , `` Bomb Cuba

a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who's boss ''
brigadier of the club's locker-room light infantry , and at one time or another declared war on Russia , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and China
began on an autumn afternoon -- and who , after all these centuries , can describe the fineness of an autumn day
pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose , that there would never be another like it
and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year's lights
burning somewhere and the smoke smelled , for all its ammoniac acidity , of beginnings
blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum
house one late afternoon , Mrs. Pastern stopped to admire the October light
the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis
had been given sixteen names , a bundle of literature , and a printed book of receipts
her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks
stood on a rise of ground , and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below
she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof she saw signified charity
worked for the brain
Eyke did mental health
worked for the blind
was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat
was tuberculosis , Mrs. Surcliffe was Mothers' March of Dimes , Mrs. Craven was cancer , and Mrs. Gilkson did the kidney
led the birthcontrol league , Mrs. Ryerson was arthritis , and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of Ethel Littleton's house , a roof that signified gout
undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer
her destiny ; ; it was her life
had done it before her , and even her old grandmother , who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers
had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance , and most of them were ready for her
none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias
there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry
were ahead of what she had got the previous year , and while the money , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks
at the Surcliffes' after dusk , and had a Scotch-and-soda
too late , and when she left , it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband
got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund '' , she said excitedly when he walked in
did everybody on my list but the Blevins and the Flannagans
to get my kit in tomorrow morning -- would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner ''
I don't know the Flannagans '' , Charlie Pastern said
does , but they gave me ten last year ''
tired , he had his business worries , and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day
happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins' , thinking that they might give him a drink
Blevins were away ; ; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door
at the Flannagans' driveway , he tried to remember if he had ever met them
encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish
a glass pane in the front door , and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers
hepatitis '' , he shouted heartily
a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and , walking with very small steps , started toward the door
, please come in '' , she said
voice was nearly a whisper
not a girl , he could see
was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight
wife just called '' , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child
I am not sure that I have any cash -- any money , that is -- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you out a check if I can find my checkbook
step into the living room , where it's cozier ''
had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous
Mr. Flannagan , he wondered
on a late train
clothes upstairs
shower
end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers , and she began to riffle these , making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation
am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait
the table ''
train does Mr. Flannagan come out on ''
Flannagan is away '' , she said
dropped
Flannagan has been away for six weeks
I'll have a drink , then , if you'll have one with me ''
you will promise to make it weak ''
down '' , he said , `` and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later
way to find things is to relax ''
all , they had six drinks
herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly
manufactured plastic tongue depressors
all over the world
like to travel
her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home
her husband had formerly lived in New York , where she had many friends , but Mr. Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war
rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom
no children ; ; she had made no friends
seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous coyness , patting his knee
seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible
thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness
, he knew , is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions
merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass
its humble place in the scale of things , why did he , at this time of life , seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness
she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there
never done this before '' , she said later , when he was arranging himself to leave
shook with feeling , and he thought it lovely
doubt her truthfulness , although he had heard the words a hundred times
never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders
never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor
never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey
never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their stockings
at sea , on railroad trains , in summer hotels with mountain views , they always said , `` I've never done this before ''
have you been ''
asked sadly , when he came in
after eleven ''

told me he was in Germany ''

the only meaning of the word that he had ever known
played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries
was tied up in a Nassau hotel , an Ohio pottery works , and a detergent for window-washing , and luck had been running against him
harried him up out of bed , and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window
starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves
summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track , and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying , like leaves , in the gutters near Belmont and Saratoga
ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth
home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage
getting back into bed , he thought unashamedly of Mrs. Flannagan , planning where they would next meet and what they would do
, he thought , so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed , as it did , a little crude
not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years , not since their last journey eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil ; ; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives ( two marriages , two births , one divorce ) , Christmas and Easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years
were not discrete
was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons
the chair arms and brought her thin body upright , like a bird alert for flight
and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire , warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray
extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters , one to Abel , one to Mark
trembling hand , with the pen grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper the words came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips
stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string
come down as soon as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen , `` I have an important matter to discuss with you ''
: `` I am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here

stay as long as you wish , of course , but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account , I think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in ''
: `` Please give my regards to Myra ''
the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town
went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water
nephews will be coming down '' , she said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room , the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray
at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years ; ; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way , they had faded to a near-absence of color which had , possibly from her constant looking at the water , something of the light of the sea in them

fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips
instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile
have said triumph
turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen
lifted her head and followed the retreating figure , her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips
moment she held her face to the empty doorway ; ; then she snorted and groped for her fork
greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family
expansion , proliferation -- these are the laws of living things , with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments : oblivion
fate of the individual is visited on the group , then ( the warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted
the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth
the last living of the older generation
once been a widespread family -- at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county -- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark
her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans
lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name

to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows
too , she talked low , quirking her head at one or another of the places , most often at Izaak's armchair which faced her across the long table
might have been the absent nephews she addressed , consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years
again of her children , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies
, her first , she barely remembered
have been anyone's infant , for it had not survived the bassinet
boy the boy had been alive yesterday
movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her
on his plump sticks of legs , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire
cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged , quick with the delight of laughter , and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her
one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea
drove down together in Mark's small red sports car , Mark at the wheel
spoke
and regarded the farm country which , spreading out from both sides of the road , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields
the land with a stranger's eyes , all the old familiarness gone
presented itself to him as it would to any stranger , impervious , complete in itself
stability there , too -- a color which his life had had once
what childhood is , he told himself
settled lost
stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica's letter
grace , what incredible selfishness he and Mark had shown
summers preceding their uncle's funeral might never have been
closed over , absolutely , with the sealing of old Izaak's grave
car flew on relentlessly
woman , stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality
and adjusted his long legs
suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters
the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness
Mark were the last of the family , and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon to horizon , in those golden days of summer
turned his head to look at his brother
the wheel loosely , but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come
hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away
looked years older than himself , settled , his world comfortably categorized
traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea
didn't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane
probably getting old -- crotchety , I mean -- and we figured uh-uh , better not
met , you know
wouldn't budge without an express invitation
kind of bad about it ''
Abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel , hugging it to him , and Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt
imagine the old girl hasn't missed us much '' , Mark added , his eyes on the road
the half-expressed bid for confirmation

barely possible that his brother was right
tell they were approaching the sea
took on a special strength now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind
the smell of the coast , like a primeval memory , composed of equal parts salt water , clams , seaweed and northern air
from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended
must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant
the Starbird
asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down
Starbird , '' Abel said
the day Uncle Izaak had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture , handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished
of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could
then to have had a single mind and body , a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth , casually
the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky
them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails
had been long at the bottom of the bay
unexpectedly upon the sea
without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them
climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness , became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended
the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water , which , there being no moon out , at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars
were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky they'd glare at my noise , growing red and raising up his rage
I hated the Pedersen kid too , dying in our kitchen while I was away where I couldn't watch , dying just to entertain Hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall , Pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow , snoring and whistling
not care about the Pedersen kid
care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain
make him mad enough if he was sober
hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen
all shoveled up like I thought he'd be
at his shoulder , calling his name
his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when I shoved him
slid down his skinny neck so I saw his head , fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed , but his face was turned to the wall -- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster -- and I thought , Well you don't look much like a pig-drunk bully now
be sure he was still asleep
a cagey sonofabitch
him a little harder and made some noise
'' , I said
leaning too far over
better
slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him
was smart
you off
better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough
arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck , watering my eyes , and I backed off to cough
on his side , looking at me , his eyes winking , the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow
the hell out of here ''
say anything , trying to get my throat clear , but I watched him
like a mean horse to come at from the rear
better , though , he'd hit me
bitter when he missed
the hell out of here ''
Hans sent me
me to wake you ''
fat hell on Big Hans
of here ''
found the Pedersen kid by the crib ''
the hell out ''
at the covers
tasting his mouth
kid's froze good
rubbing him with snow
him in the kitchen ''
''
, Pa
Pedersen kid
''
to steal from the crib ''
stealing , Pa
just lying there
him froze
he was when Hans found him ''

ain't hid nothing in the crib ''
don't understand , Pa
kid
'' -- `` I goddamn well understand ''
his head up , glaring , his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd grown a mustache once
goddamn well understand
I don't want to see Pedersen

I
he come for , hey
, get
come back
something
fool
and Hans


back


shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow
long black hairs on his wrist
around the cuff of his nightshirt
Hans made me come
said '' -- `` A fat hell on Big Hans
even bigger fool than you are
hey
him , dammit , and I'll teach you

me to drop my pot ''
about to get up so I got out , slamming the door
beginning to see he was too mad to sleep
threw things
went after Hans and dumped his pot over the banister
shit-sick in that pot
an axe
even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of Pa's door down before he stopped
not have gone that far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house
put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it
felt the memory was present in both of them , stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl , as eager as an animal to be out
Pa cursing all the way downstairs
laid steaming towels over the kid's chest and stomach
rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet
the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid's back and behind
he going to wake up ''
about your pa ''
was awake when I left ''
he say
get the whisky ''
said a fat hell on Big Hans ''
be smart
ask him about the whisky ''
''
''
said a fat hell on Big Hans ''
be smart
going to do ''
back to sleep most likely ''
best get that whisky ''
go
axe
to hell of axes ''
to me , Jorge , I've had enough to your sassing
froze bad
don't get some whisky down him he might die
the kid to die

get your pa and get that whisky ''
don't care about the kid ''
''
he don't
care at all , and I don't care to get my head busted neither
care , and I don't care to have his shit flung on me
care about anybody
cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face
-- that's what he wants
care about nothing else at all

kid neither

kid neither ''
get the spirits '' , Ma said
Big Hans up tight
ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down
went near the old man when he was sleeping it off
more
years
thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot cleat , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock popping out as it flew
have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides
you won't '' , Big Hans said
, Hans , if they're needed '' , Ma said
his head but neither of us tried to stop her
had , then one of us would have had to go instead
the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed
get more snow '' , I said
the pail and shovel and went out on the porch
know where Ma went
she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had
surprised Hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat
he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm
awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn't thinking about that at all , not anything like that
no way of getting even
like getting cheated at the fair
always trying so you got to expect it
had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable ; ; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back
the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap
put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she'd done
found one of Pa's hiding places
one and she hadn't said a word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter , every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had looked in the privy and found the first one
a knack for hiding
we were looking and he enjoyed it
Ma
it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found , saying nothing
sure to find out
didn't seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't hid one after all or had drunk it up
find out about this one because we were using it
could see what was going on
found out Ma found it -- that'd be bad
pride in his hiding
all the pride he had
fooling Hans and me took doing
didn't figure Ma for much
figure her at all , and if he found out a woman it'd be bad
some in a tumbler
going to put more towels on him ''
''
not
he needs , something warm to his skin , don't he ''
where he's froze good
for frostbite
I only put towels on his chest and belly
to thaw slow
to know that ''
the towels had run
her toe in the kid's clothes
are we going to do with these ''
began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin
, help me prop him up
hold his mouth open ''
want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to
on , Jorge ''
right ''
, don't shove lift ''
, I'm lifting ''
him by the shoulders
flopped back
fell open
on his neck was tight
cold all right
his head up
''
mouth is open ''
throat's shut
''
choke anyway ''
his head up ''
can't ''
hold him like that
arms around him ''
Jesus ''
cold all right
my arm carefully around him
his fingers in the kid's mouth
he'll choke for sure ''
up
him like I told you ''
cold all right , and wet
my arm behind his back
in his mid-fifties at this time , long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing
never a doubt any more how his structures would be received ; ; it was always the same unqualified success now
no longer build anything , whether a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time , a quality of authentic uniqueness about them , which , once established by an artist as his private vision , is no longer disputable as to its other values
was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality
lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife , a remarkably childish thing in itself ; ; he rose at half-past six every morning , made himself some French coffee , had his corn flakes and more coffee , smoked four cigarettes while reading last Sunday's Herald Tribune and yesterday's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop
an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks , some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist
of his other careers was piled everywhere ; ; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill , vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air , masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house , visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor
, desk , drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos
his ideas lay or hung in visible form : his models , drawings , ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac
he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house
standing , with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment , sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person's hand
would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved
seemed -- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows -- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's work
of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things , and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine
was not bored at all ; ; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it
, after all , fortunate souls who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey was , as things go , a fortunate man
his home the day after New Year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat
wear this same costume in Florida , despite his wife Cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him
was too busy to hear what she was saying
parted when she was in an impatient humor
was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon , feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before , she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her head , which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window
key under his shoe , he started the engine , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator ''
the surprise in her face , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen
on laughing until she started laughing with him
a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it
settle himself into his seat to laugh
laughed it was all he was doing
was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog , mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to , mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by
forty-nine at this time , a lanky woman of breeding with an austere , narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer
were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders
an air of blindness in her gray eyes , the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which , besides , has kept its estate intact
personally sloppy , and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist , and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves
when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air , and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy , a grace of history , so to speak , and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value
spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp
drive carefully , for God's sake ''
, trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure
did not notice , and was already backing the car down to the road , saying `` Toot-toot ''
stump of a tree as he passed it , the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed
clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road
when he had it pointed down the hill , he stopped to gaze at her through the window
begun to turn back toward the house , but his look caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell
at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant at a time , the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs , the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery on a Thursday once
kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said `` Toot ''
and roared off into the fog , his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator , just as his hand did when he worked
back to the house and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building
a death in all partings , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind
great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life
could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; ; she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; ; improvise cha-chas on the harp ; ; and finally , the best part of all , simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers , reading the ads as well as the news , registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire
this now , comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows , of the silence outside , of the dark afternoon it was getting to be
asleep leaning on her hand , hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years , hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm
minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things : Stowey , yes , was on his way south , and the two boys were away in school , and nothing was burning on the stove , and Lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers
fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes
up , smoothing her hair down , straightening her clothes , feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside , and , above everything else , for the absence of the need to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future without him , a future alone like this , and the pain made her head writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia to come with her guests
into the living room and turned on three lamps , then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn , illuminating the driveway
she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself
both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting
it have been thirty years already , she wondered
, nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen
still over the leg of lamb , rubbing herbs into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath , a sensation of violence that started her shivering
all said , `` No , your time will come
a bride while you can ''
no room for company in the tiny Weaning House ( where the Albright boys always took their brides , till they could get a house and a farm of their own )
the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes
was still not anything that Linda Kay could do
Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve
so , she was really grateful ; ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe's wife
made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe
done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this
, she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night
was gone all day now , not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper
first married he had been working in the fields all day , and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal
was no work in the fields , nor would there be till it rained , and she did not know where he went
she complained , or had any cause to
five of the cousins from East Texas were about his age , so naturally they ran around together
no reason for her to ask what they did
new pattern of days began to develop , for Granny Albright did not die
still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; ; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk or soup
expecting her to die the next minute , but only in the next day or two
had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home , for she might die any time ; ; but they might as well unpack their suitcases , for she might linger on
pattern was established
Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go to the Big House
not anything she could do there , but that was where everyone was , or would be
and the boys would come by , say `` How's Granny ''
on the porch a while
men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town
and children stayed at the Albrights'
, keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room , sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night
had to play away from the house ( in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn ) , to maintain a proper quietness
on , all day , someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything
cooler had been moved to Granny's room , and her door was kept shut ; ; so that the rest of the house stayed open , though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way
clogged their throats , and the heat parched them , so that the women were always making ice water
cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town , as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there
, as the women sat clucking softly , a new carload of people pulled up at the gate
a Cadillac , black grayed with the dust of the road , its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled
an old fat couple ( as Linda Kay described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man , and a girl about ten or twelve
much embracing , much exclaiming
Ada
''
Lura ''
Howard ''
how is she ''
the same , John , about the same ''
women got up and offered their chairs , and when they were all seated again , the guests made their inquiries and their explanations
were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming , `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home
on as soon as we could ''
the suggestion of ice water , and -- in spite of the protest `` We're not really thirsty '' -- Linda Kay , to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices , hurried to the kitchen
a big pitcher and set it , with glasses , on a tray
to the living room , she imagined the picture she made : tall and roundly slim , a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath , with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band
she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain , at such a time , in such a place , and she tossed back her long yellow hair , smiling shyly as she entered the room
the thick middle-aged man ) was looking at her
the look and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed
who is this ''
, when she passed him a glass
that's Linda Kay '' , Mama Albright said fondly
married our baby boy , Bobby Joe , this summer ''
see '' , Cousin Ada said
a right smart younger than the rest ''
yes '' , Mama laughed
ten years younger than Ernest
expect him to come along ; ; thought for the longest he was a tumor ''
was not funny to Linda Kay , and she blushed , as she always did ; ; then , hearing the muffled boom of Howard's laughter , blushed redder
is Howard , anyway ''
Bobby Joe that night
makes me uncomfortable ''
he's a second cousin or something
in the oil business out at Odessa and lucked into some money ''
old is he ''
, I don't know
I guess
married and got this half-grown kid
bothers you , don't pay him any mind
a big windbag ''
was thinking about something else
, did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope season on the Double J ''
talking about antelope again when they woke up
, I never had a chance to kill an antelope
was a season before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth ''
he ever visit here when he was a kid ''
asked
''
''
, I don't know
was a kid I wasn't around ''
took a gun from behind the door , and with a quick `` Bye now '' was gone for the day
Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac
going after ice '' , Howard said , `` and thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company ''
really no reason to refuse , and Linda Kay had never ridden in a Cadillac
the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked
said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda Kay told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life
such a well-rounded teenager , having been a twirler , Future Farmers sweetheart , and secretary of Future Homemakers
sophomore year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe , who was a football player , Future Homemakers sweetheart , and president of Future Farmers
easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted
would be a senior this year , and he planned to graduate
was no need for Linda Kay to go on , since all she wanted in life was to make a home for Bobby Joe and ( blushing ) raise his children

lucky kids '' , he said
give anything if I could have found a girl like you ''
told Linda Kay about himself
he couldn't say much , really , because of Debora , but Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got
her feel different about Howard
going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins home for supper , and all they did was talk about antelope
was trying to get Linda Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home
a whole antelope ''

, I couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak ; ; I never even saw any ''
, you could
to roast the whole thing , and have it for the boys ''
told him he couldn't do anything like that with his Grandma dying , and he said well they had to eat , didn't they , they weren't all dying
felt like going off to the bedroom to cry ; ; but they were going up to the Big House after supper , and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little
they all went to Mama and Papa Albright's , and sat on the open front porch , where they could get the breeze
full-of-the-moon ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day
sat around and drank ice water , and the men smoked , and everybody had a good time
a while they said what a shame it was , with Granny dying , but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other way
the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night
and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting , and Uncle Bill Farnworth ( from Mama Albright's side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then
had left , some of the people moved around , to find more comfortable places to sit
not many chairs , so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch , resting their feet on the ground , and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall
who had been sitting against the wall , said he needed more fresh air , and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been sitting
be a darn sight more comfortable there , Howard '' , Ernest said , laughing , and they all laughed
felt that she was not exactly more comfortable
had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand from time to time , but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer
was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; ; but she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before
was not sorry he sat by her , but in fact was flattered
become the center of the company , such stories he had to tell
sold oil stock to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in person ; ; he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights
tell me , doctor , where do you plan to conduct the hatching ''

will have to be in the hotel '' , the doctor retorted , confirming Alex's anticipations
I want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel ''
paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel , room number nine , to initiate Alex further into these undertakings
opened the smallest of his cases , an unimposing straw bag , and exposed the contents for Alex's inspection
carefully packed in straw , were six eggs , but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; ; to Alex they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs
little enough time to contemplate them , however ; ; in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands , thoroughly eared and big as a table top
it on Alex's lap
is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way
been going since 1908 when I was a junior in college
entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe , the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties -- great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at all
them near a river , though , or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving ''
was full of most precise information : date of laying , length of incubation period , number of chick reaching the first week , second week , fifth week , weight of hen , size of rooster's wattles and so on , all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than English , the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen
particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed
was rapid , for the doctor had to go off to the Rue Ecole De Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all
the doctor's return that night Alex could see , from the high window in his own room , the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels , apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen
at Alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning
the doctor , dressed and ready for the expedition to the market , and Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste
stood about , waiting for Alex to dress , with a show of impatience , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still-dark hallways , past the bedroom of the patronne , and so into the street
was not far and , once there , the doctor's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him
the hens and they responded with delighted clucks , he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention , he quacked with the ducks , and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese
progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery
a fine broody hen , white , with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen
, with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope , drew Alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color in comb and wattles , the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles , the firm , wide spread of the toes , and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets
was ended ; ; he had found his fowl
was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , nestling in the doctor's arms
struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; ; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast
was wearing a long New England greatcoat , hardly necessary in the June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens
first and was followed by the doctor who , for all his care , manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled
in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly steps , towards the first landing
then that they heard the tread of one descending and , in some perturbation glancing up , saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing
, messieurs , vous etes matinals '' , she greeted them pleasantly
that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him , attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind Alex's arm and back
voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors ''
enquired
her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts , trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him
, he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs , but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well
in the patronne's head , Alex coughed loudly , and the doctor , with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him , took to the stairs in long-shanked leaps
''
surprised woman , looking at Alex for an explanation but he , parting from her without ceremony , only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work
he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze
entered his room , the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case , six eggs ready for the hen's attentions
no reference to the incident on the stairs , his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business
appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them
of her audience was totally engaged , the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic , the other part , the guest of the connoisseur , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand
progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote ; ; the audience attended
but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature
he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view , and Alex went to the door
it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling , coughing , and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest
Giselle , the fille de chambre , come to clean the room , and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity , explaining her errand , Alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird
reluctant but Alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again
was that , young feller ''
instantly asked
was the fille de chambre , the one you thought couldn't get the eggs out
mighty interested , though
coming back in five minutes to do the room ''
mind was working at a great speed ; ; he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice
you got our keys handy ''
in my pocket ''
right
go outside and beckon me when it's safe ''
was empty and Alex beckoned ; ; they climbed the stairs which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears , and reached the next floor
was locking his room ; ; they passed behind him and got to Alex's room unnoticed
sat down rather wearily , caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man , but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more
door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes
evident that a second transfer had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began Alex's
three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; ; the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door
of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside ; ; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact
shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob , but to no effect : the lavatory was occupied
look of alarm passed over his face , he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine
those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat ; ; unwarranted they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room
of the last quarter of an hour , mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard , had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails , perhaps mourning her nest , but briefly enjoyed
wits had not left him , however , for all his sixty-eight years , and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out from the showerhead
to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room
the doctor himself entered , his hair somewhat wet from the shower , but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures
he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside
the hen was nested and all seemed well
men sat for some time , savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings , before they got up and left the hotel , the doctor to go to the conference house and Alex to go to the main post office
to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood
time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen , who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning
have short memories '' , the doctor remarked , `` that's why they are better company than most people I know '' , and he went on to break some important news to Alex
'' , he began , `` It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do
a big vulture from Tanganika at the zoo here , with a wife for him , too , very rare birds , both of them , the only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa
she's willing , but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then didn't know what to do , and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble
with the tray , Winston wished he could have given in to Miss Ada , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look
times it wasn't right to make a person happy , like the times she came in the kitchen and asked know we don't keep peanut `` butter for a peanut butter sandwich
this house '' , he always told her
, Winston '' , she'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar ''
knew how important it was for her to keep her figure
kitchen , Leona , his little young wife , was reading the morning paper
hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool
'' , Winston said gently , `` what's these dishes doing not washed ''
plates which had held Mr. Jack's four fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink
me alone '' , Leona said
you see I'm busy ''
at him impudently over the corner of the paper
is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made

had fastened on her leg ; ; bending , he touched her knee
I catch you one more time down here without stockings '' -- She twitched her leg away
, fuss , old man ''
an alley cat's manners
Miss Ada's thin pink dishes in the sink
spread out the last list on the counter
Be Left Behind '' was printed at the top in Miss Ada ; ; fine hand
out a pencil , admired the point , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` Clothes Stand ''
Leona dropped the paper and stood up
guess I better get ready to go ''
her fumbling to untie her apron
''
he undid the bow
come your bows is always cockeyed ''
and put her arms around his neck
don't want to leave here , Winston ''
listen to that ''
back , embarrassed and pleased
thought you was sick to death of this big house
wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms ''
least there is room here '' , she said
room is there going to be in an apartment for any child ''
told you what Miss Ada's doctor said ''
don't mean Miss Ada
think I care about that
our children ''
as though they already existed
of the hundred things he had on his mind , Winston went and put his arm around her waist
got plenty of time to think about that
time in the world
been married four years , January ''
years ''

a long time , waiting ''
many times have I told you '' -- he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off -- `` Too many times ''
flounced to the sink , where she began noisily to wash her hands
times was the truth of it , Winston thought
believed his reason himself any more
had seemed a good reason , to begin with : no couple could afford to have children
you going to work with a child hanging on you ''
Leona
want to keep this job , don't you ''
whether she heard him , over the running water
for a while with his hands on his knees , watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things -- a comb , a bottle of aspirin -- to take upstairs and pack
him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; ; it was something to do with her back , the thinness of it , and the quick , jerky way she bent
too young , that was all ; ; too young and thin and straight
''
Mr. Jack , bellowing out in the hall
through the swinging door
been bursting my lungs for you '' , Mr. Jack complained
standing in front of the mirror , tightening his tie
on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench
don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes '' , he said
coat looks like a rag heap ''
a few blades of lint on the shoulder
the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work
Mr. Jack a real going-over ; ; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long , firm strokes
''
cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes
and quickly set the hat right
stood back to look at Mr. Jack , who was pulling on his pigskin gloves
seeing him start out ; ; he wore his clothes with style
was going to town , nothing was good enough -- he had cursed at Winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace
, he wouldn't even wash his hands for supper , and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys
smoking jackets , pearl-gray , wine , and blue , which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet
, Winston '' , Mr. Jack said , giving a final set to his hat
out for those movers ''
him hurry down the drive to his car ; ; a handsome , fine-looking man it made him proud to see
Jack drove away , Winston went on looking out the window
a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger
looked at his finger , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up , slit , and open
first time , he be sad about the move
was ten years off his life let himself
handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier
the house like a blind man , through his fingers , and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up
ago , he had come to the house to be interviewed
and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive , and he had walked up from the bus almost singing
had been out back , in a straw hat , planting flowers
talked to him right there , with the hot sun in his face , which made him sweat and feel ashamed
been surprised at her for that
he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- citron yellow , if he remembered
had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan
, the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill
jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate , and the periwinkles were coming on , blue by the porch steps
week the hyacinths would spike out
dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada's alfresco party ; ; and after that the Japanese cherries
yard looked wet and bald , the trees bare under their buds , but in a while Miss Ada's flowers would bloom like a marching parade
dug a hole for each bulb , each tree wore a tag with her writing on it ; ; where would she go for her gardening now
didn't think she'd take to window boxes
he hurried to the living room
a thousand things to see to
he couldn't help thinking , we're all getting old , getting small ; ; the snail is pulling in her horns
living room , Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand
looking out at the garden
'' , she said , `` get the basket for the breakables ''
the big straw basket ready in the hall
it in and put it down beside her
was looking fine ; ; she had on her Easter suit , blue , with lavender binding
the house , he could have smelled her morning perfume
in all her day clothes , sweet and strong ; ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston raised her dresses to his face
Miss Ada studied the list
, let's see
lemon tree
cockatoo ''
her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrapping them in tissue paper
them trusted the movers
came to Mr. Jack's photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame , Miss Ada said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won't take my clotheshorse ''
at Winston , and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes
up the photograph and began to wrap it
least you could leave it for the movers '' , Miss Ada said
possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea ''
the tissue paper carefully
used it every day ; ; every morning , I lay out his clothes on it ''
, that's over now
was his main present
fool picture out '' , she added sharply
it in the basket
Jack sets store by that ''
, Winston
meant to be my present ''
went on down the list
relieved ; ; those presents had been on his mind
only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack
know what she likes , Winston '' , he had said wearily , one evening in November when Winston was pulling off his overshoes
me what to get her for Christmas ''
been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him

picture of me ''
had persuaded him
night , they had had a disagreement about it
heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room
door , he had seen Mr. Jack walking around , waiting for Miss Ada
had come down ; ; Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown
do you like it ''
asked
had said , `` You look about fifteen years old ''
that a compliment ''
don't know ''
stood at a little distance , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head
, you make me feel naked ''
had giggled , and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down
look like that picture I have at the office '' , Mr. Jack had started
a line , not a wrinkle
like an old man , compared '' , and he had picked up his photograph with the red Christmas bow still on it
, an old man
wear pink when you're sixty ''
, I love that photograph
to put it on my dresser ''
guess it's children make a woman old
gets old anyhow ''
minute he went on , `` People must think the curse is on me , seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray ''
give you a medical certificate , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said

want is a picture -- with a few lines
man put them in if he has to ''
they had sat for five minutes without saying a word
Ada had stood up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs
love
no doubt that it was
rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of Catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of Jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation and delight
all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp , the packing away of my camp uniforms , the severing of ties with the six or ten people I had grown most to love in the world
separation from them , in the railroad terminal across the river from New York , I would nearly cry
welcoming arms would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted
year was different , for just as the city , in the form of my street clothes , had intruded upon my mountain nights , so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall : Jessica and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs , had agreed to correspond
became the center of my existence
to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer
has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink , scented stationery and the unsloped , almost printed configurations of her neat , studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer , so many sentences beginning with `` Remember when ; ; '' and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood , , and news of her commencing again her piano lessons , her private school , a visit to Boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough , wounded , from the war in Europe
letters I took on a personality that differed from the self I knew in real life
me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques , full of dash and wit and glamor , quoting from the books I read , imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special , after-school class I was enrolled
took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands -- he of the porch steps anecdotes -- who smoked cigarettes , performed the tango , wore fifty dollar suits , and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them
, in my fantasies , I had a proud bearing and , with a skill that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits , would guide her gently to the night's climax which , in my dreams , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep , moist kisses burning with love
after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle -- it must have been late in September -- I had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from The Front , nearly dying , my head bandaged and blooded , and Jessica bending over me , the power of her love bringing me back to life
nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep
went by , and the longer our separation grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became
my love for Jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again
turned out , Jessica took matters into her own hands
permission to give a camp reunion-Halloween party , she asked that I come and be her date
and , mum and nervous , all but made a fool of myself
those jubilantly reunited bunkmates , I was shy with Jessie and acted as I had during those early Saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom , later , in the privacy of our bunks , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance
standing in a corner , watching Jessica act the hostess , serving soft drinks to her guests
wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween
her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it
moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages , out of my mind , and plant himself in reality
late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others
and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek
outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions of lust , all the mysterious sensations that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me
at that party that , finally overcoming my timidity , inspired by tales only half-understood and overheard among older boys , I asked Jessie to spend New Year's Eve with me
she accepted , and so great was my emotion that all I could think of saying was , `` You're amazing , you know ''
we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night
write to one another and make a definite plan
terribly pleased
school and neighborhood friends , during the next months , I bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date
I boasted and gave off a dapper front , I was beneath it all frightened
be the first time I had ever been completely alone with a girl I loved
no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl , or how one behaved : Should I hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street
bring along a corsage or send one to her
preferable to meet her at home or in the city
accompany her to the door of her home , or should I ask to be invited in
out , should I kiss her goodnight
was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year
one letter Jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on New Year's Eve , I knew for a moment an immense relief ; ; but the letter went on : she had cried , she had implored , she had been miserable at his refusal , and finally he had relented -- and now how happy she was , how expectant
gave me heart
confidence into myself
inquiries , I read a book of etiquette
I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the Hotel Astor , a rendezvous spot that I had learned was the most sophisticated
attend a film and , later on , I stated , we might go to the Mayflower Coffee Shop or Child's or Toffenetti's for waffles
the hour of our meeting for seven
o'clock that night it was already dark , and behind my closed door I was dressing as carefully as a groom
a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil's ears
leather wallet , bulky with twisted , raised stitches around the edges , I stuffed with money I had been saving
in an overcoat of rough blue wool , I was given a proud farewell by my mother and father , and I set out into the strangely still streets of Brooklyn
superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement of Manhattan
, when I ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks swarming with celebrants , with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey
severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic
was cold but the crowd kept one warm
electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted , and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner
, substitutes for the unavailable tin models , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along Broadway , and one's ears were continually serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats
gentlemen next to me held a Boy Scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out , `` V for Victory ''
cheered him on
a great sense of camaraderie
one join them
they all walking to
supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for Jessica
a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking
over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing than I
away
for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to greet Jessica
would we go after the movie
lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we couldn't get in
hadn't brought along enough money
for my wallet
, substantial outline calmed me
I saw that it was already ten past seven , I began to wonder if something had gone wrong
father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave
this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans
uneasy
me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place , like abrupt , jerky scenes in old silent movies , joyous greetings and beginnings , huggings and kissings , enthusiastic forays into the festive night
were taking up new positions on the steps , arriving and departing , while I stayed glued , like a signpost , to one spot
two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps , carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway , and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground , their golden , fringed epaulets and spic , red-visored caps , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders Jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd
almost stopped beating
thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning I left for Hanover , most of them disturbed and hallucinating
, a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us
lonely and depressed as I stared out the bus window at Chicago's grim , dirty West Side
incredible , as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients , that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the mentally ill
thought of Mary Jane Brennan , the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger , her quiet competence , the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses
become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital
told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall Field & Co.
that I lived at a good address on the Gold Coast , that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies
also that I was unmarried and without a single known relative
quite sure that I felt enough remorse about my drinking , or that I would not return to it once I was out and on my own again
worried her
read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had said
must have loved that girl very much , but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her ''
do you say that ''

was full of booze and , well , a drunk is apt to do anything he says he'll do ''

up in an Irish neighborhood on Chicago's West Side
me about drunks
the kind to go violent
in love with that girl ''
it make any difference to you if I were , Mary Jane ''
my eyes , suddenly angry
wouldn't have gone into nursing if I didn't care about people
in every patient I've helped take care of
think of people like you , well , I '' -- `` You what , Mary Jane ''
are young , intelligent , have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess it up with whiskey , indifference , self-destructive attitudes
blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you
pretty ''
, yes '' , I said , feeling annoyed , `` she was very pretty
believe that I'm going back to medical school and finish , do you ''
should I
this ward for three months now
getting the same ones back again and again
mean well , have great promises to make when they are about to go home , but drinking is their sickness
seemed like them , but maybe you are
your stay here like a big joke
a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover
to go to college , too '' -- `` Why didn't you ''

has some of the best '' -- Her eyes flashed angrily
what I mean about you , Anderson '' , she said
don't seem to know much about reality
you why I didn't go to college ; ; I'm the oldest of six children
a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year
no money for tuition , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take for granted
here doesn't cost anything
pay me six dollars a month
it's a good deal
to become a good nurse , and I've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if I have to work at my profession until I'm an old maid to give it to them ''
you have a boy friend ''

none of your business '' , she said , then changed the subject
about your father and mother , don't you think of them when you're in a place like this ''
father and mother died when I was two years old '' , I said
aunt raised me
died when I was doing my military service
no one but myself to worry about ''
my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly , and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face
sorry '' , she said
don't know what I'd do without my family
been so close ''
me more about them ''
became bright as she talked about her father and mother , aunts and uncles , cousins
I felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can
had finished I said : `` Your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman
he wouldn't be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date -- I mean , after I'm out of the hospital , a month or so from now ''
father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years
pretty good judge of character , Anderson
think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a rumdum in the future ''
about you
you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get through at Hanover ''
I thought you were serious about going back to school , that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover -- well , I might consider such an offer
your that girl you were going to kill ''
seemed very important to me that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believed me to be
are things about me that I can't tell you now , Mary Jane '' , I said , `` but if you'll go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover , I'd like to tell you the whole story
say this : I'm dead serious about going back to school
that other girl , let's just say that I never want to see her again
get to come home on long weekends from Hanover , won't you ''
, I'll get one overnight a month ''
go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner '' , I said
you like to dance
have a good orchestra ''
like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away
been anything really personal in her interest in me
that
just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there
riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before
the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me
a fantastic story
people in the state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover State Hospital under an assumed name , or why
unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary Jane Brennan would believe it without proof
had the proof , all documented in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so
bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order
suddenly as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me , if I had not perhaps imagined it all
was reality and Dale Nelson , the actor , was delusion ; ; a figment of Carl Anderson's imagination
had come to Chicago from New York early in September with a dramatic production called Ask Tony
a bad play , real grade-A turkey , which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal
, not even the producer , had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway
it was a suspense gangster story of the Capone era , many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago , continue as a road company , and eventually become a movie
was completely unjustified
literally screamed their indignation
was doomed from the moment Kupcinet leveled on it in his Sun-Times column
on Friday and closed the following Monday
the entire cast I alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer
me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company , two members of which were native Chicagoans
paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York
lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the Croydon Hotel
to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another
been among the top third in my class at N.Y.U. , had wanted desperately to go to medical school , but I'd run out of money and energy at the same time
I had quit my safe , secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play
to me that I was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well
that I'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open
occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting , that I was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going to do with my life
the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up , then went to the bathroom for a drink of water
rang
answered it a voice too dignified and British to be real said , `` Is this Mr. Dale Nelson , the actor ''
right '' , I said
don't you bastards lay off for a while ''
beg your pardon , sir ''
right
Dale Nelson the actor ''

you , Mr. Nelson , at the request of Mr. Phillip Wycoff
possibly have lunch with him today
could pick you up at your hotel at twelve ''

send the Rolls-Royce , of course ''
, of course , Mr. Nelson ''
to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung up
went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of Ask Tony
bowed low as I approached them
right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink ''
a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round
just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me
over to him
Mr. Nelson ''

right ''
Wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east entrance ''
him out through the lobby to the street
Rolls-Royce , as shiningly impressive as the day it came off the ship , was parked at the curb
chauffeur , immaculate in a dark uniform , stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car
giving the parked cars the once-over
with the license number JYJ 114 was in stall number five
'' , I said to the attendant , `` I'll let you know if I close the deal on the office in this building ''
with him back to the entrance
me a ticket on the agency car and parked it
back in ten minutes
to get something out of the car '' , I told him , showing him my ticket
to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and said , `` Oh , yes
one I was talking to about a monthly rental
right '' , I told him
the parking ticket , then looked at a notation and said , `` You're in the third row back toward the rear
find it all right ''
'' , I told him
back to the agency car and got out an electric bug , one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing
keep a set in the car
in new batteries so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully
until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , then slipped around the back of the car with license number JYM 114 , attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out
waved me on
the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street , trying to make himself inconspicuous , keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting
first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays , then in people passing by
while , however , a person's mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment
to sit down
muscles and back muscles feel weary
of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city pavements are hard
a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building
out alone
far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car
recognized me once more and said , `` What did you do about that office ''
haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said
a sublease
a couple of them I'm figuring on ; ; one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking ''
curb parking is undependable and annoying , particularly when it rains '' , he said
trying to get him to take my money
'' , I told him
in a rush right now
where the car is
to drive it out ''
have one of the boys get it '' , he said
one of the rules on transients
out their own cars ''
it as snappy as you can , will you ''

, that's all right '' , he said
going to be a regular
in the office building here
want to lease a place way out in the sticks
business where the business is , not where it isn't ''
at him , handed him a couple of dollars and said , `` By the time you get the parking charge figured up , there should be a cigar in it for you ''
over to the agency heap , jumped in , started the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left
held up a bit trying to make a left turn
time I'd made it he was gone
pretty heavy
on the electric bug , and the signal came in loud and clear
time and picked him up within ten blocks
half a block behind him , letting lots of cars keep in between us , listening to the steady beep beep beep
minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left
see him , but the electric bugging device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead , short half beeps when the car I was following was to the left , and long drawn-out beeps when it turned to the right
ever got behind me , the beep turned to a buzz
left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right
while the signal became a buzz and I knew he was behind me
he'd parked someplace
a big circle until I located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house
a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited
was in the apartment house for two hours
came out and started driving toward the beach
time it was dark
get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic
would have been a giveaway if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner
I'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing device
was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz
the block and found he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant
where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry
there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee
came out an hour later , drove to the beach , turned right and after half a mile went to the Swim and Tan Motel
a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front
it was the Peeping Tom place
until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register
the man I was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter
that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of Oscar L. Palmer and wife , giving a San Francisco address
written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures , an old dodge which is still good
out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't check the license number on the plates against the license number the tenant writes out
does , it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the transposition of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake
the alias of Robert C. Richards , gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap , but a couple of phony numbers in between
have written anything
of the motel was a woman who apparently didn't care
complying with the law in regard to registrations but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering the tenants
mean you're all alone , Mr. Richards ''
right ''
wife isn't going to join you -- later ''
don't think so ''
you expect her to show up '' , she said , `` you'd better put ' and wife ' on there
formality , you know ''
difference in the rate ''

to you '' , she said smiling
ten dollars either way
ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office
three soft-drink vending machines , and if you should be joined by -- anybody -- try to keep things quiet , if you will
to run a nice quiet place ''
you '' , I told her
another sidelong glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car
was reasonably solid ; ; not like the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment
a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side I wanted to case
aid of that I could hear my man moving around , heard him cough a couple of times , heard the toilet flush , heard the sound of water running
companion was going to be , she was going to join him later
where to come
have to telephone
so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed
thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing a meal , but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's bedded down for the night , hunger can be a gnawing torture
noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile
on the bugging device I had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals
microphone I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation , and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry
in the car , drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included , a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible
wasn't particularly busy at that time of night , and the girl who was waiting on me , who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be sociable
really in a hurry , Handsome ''

in a hurry , Beautiful ''
early in the evening to be in a hurry
of time left ''
may not be any women left '' , I said
a little pout and said , `` I don't get off work until eleven o'clock
my evening commences ''
be here at ten-fifty-five '' , I said
, you
announced
what they all say
thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your car ''
`` Darn it , that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on
turn it off ''
over and switched off the electronic bugging device
in to get the hamburgers , and I switched on the device again and kept the signal from Dowling's car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the hamburgers
shut off the device again
to hang around while I was eating
you think it's selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up ''
'' , I said
a kindness to her
, she's on a diet
just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and I'm to have one with her so she won't feel out of place ''
can be terrible '' , the girl said
much overweight is she ''
a bit '' , I said , `` but she's keeping her figure in hand ''
at me provocatively
figures should be kept in hand '' , she said , and walked away with an exaggerated wiggle
on the device again , half fearful that I might find silence , but the buzzes came in loud and clear
switched on the lights for her to come and get the check , I had the exact change plus a dollar tip
man said , `` All we gotta do is go around the corner ''
moved
man said , `` That-a-way ''
second building on the right ''
it says police right on the door ''
so even if we was as dumb as you take us for , we could still find it ''
Dave began to back toward the door
man waved the gun again
, `` Right around the corner ''
says water works , but there is a policeman on duty , too ''
night policeman just like in the States
''
doesn't have much of this here juvenile delinquency problem , but we keep a night policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists ''
door , Dave paused to feel for the latch
up at her husband
going to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that gun pointed at him
the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun , measured the distance from the men to the back room
to risk it
something phony about all this gun waving -- something not quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police
the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open
flash she was away to the back , paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats
open the back door
dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top
a small sideboard with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs
turned to face the men again
the counter was on his feet
between where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles
frightened gaze on the men at the counter , she began to feel her way to the door
along the booths one step at a time
followed her
reached Dave and felt his arm go around her , felt him pull her to the safety of his person , she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to Lauren
men watched as Dave closed the door behind them , watched them cross the sidewalk to their car
getting light
man removed his apron , put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket , and zipped it over his paunch
man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number
was answered , he said , `` Albert

you a couple of customers -- yeah -- just get them out of my hair and keep them out -- I don't give a damn what you tell them -- only don't believe a word they say -- they're out to make trouble for me and it is up to you to stop them -- I don't care how -- and one more thing -- Cate's Cafe closed at eleven like always last night and Rose and Clarence Corsi left for Quebec yesterday -- some shrine or other -- I think it was called Saint Simon's -- yeah , yesterday
''
from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant
Buick hadn't moved away yet

of worry formed , a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side
, `` Grosse
kidding me -- the kid don't know the name of this town ''
ain't kidding you , Vince
she
been walking in her sleep -- you seen her yourself in here ''
I know ''
how she looked when Barney held the door for her
a zombie
just waking up when we found her at the garage ''

fools -- ain't got enough brains between the two of you '' -- Grosse muttered , his head down , one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket
had enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents -- I coulda let her go go '' -- His eyes were lowered , so he couldn't have seen the narrow , pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury ; ; but he was aware of it just the same
Vince Steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be
curse , Vince seized the thing nearest , a glass sugar container with a spouted metal top , and threw it against the wall opposite
glass didn't break , but the top flew off ; ; sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence
startled , but careful to appear so , Grosse sucked noisily on his pipe
steadily
does everything have to happen to me ''
got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar
him
worked over the profanity , the obscenities in his vocabulary
said , `` Why'n hell didn't you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off
and Barney ever use your brains ''
man didn't answer
one of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter
the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser
soothingly
don't know nothing about them cars
she's in a ordinary garage ''
do you know , stupid
Cate's gun back ''
know ''
the gun under the counter
one word of this gets to Guardino '' -- `` Who's telling Guardino ''
again
get that kid over to Rose's house ''
man winced
a finger down his cheek , tracing the scratch there
can't I leave her locked up in the tool crib ''
man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock
and Barney get her over to Rose's before it gets too light
left , we'll dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home
you if she knows where she's been ''
his hands
am I going to do with her all day
tool crib she can't get away ''
the hell do I care what you do with her all day
her where Guardino won't see her and start asking questions ''
now
all , Vince
no baby sitter ''
finally , `` Get her over to Rose's and I'll come by and see that she stays put ''
the bridge of his nose where it was swollen
sullenly
don't hafta get nasty
you luck when you try scaring that kid ''
grinned
lost its sullen tones and he chuckled
got one question ''
is it ''

you a poor dumb Canadian or a smart aleck from the States ''
his hand as if to strike , but his thin lips spread in a smile
and sniggered
you say you was born ''
a Chicago slum just like you
ain't going back there on account of one lousy kid ''
rubbed her face against the blanket
cried a little because she was frightened
easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car ( she had figured that out ) , but she couldn't understand their subsequent actions
because she had shown panic
blame her for that
one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you
glad the fat man had left
not really frightening
as the little man now appeared at the window and , reaching through the opening , offered her a bottle of coke
at him wetly
found she was thirsty , she was about to refuse ( never , never take candy from a strange man ) when she saw the bottle was unopened
a bottle opener on the counter
he understood her panic
her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle
icy cold and tasted delicious
a lift in spirit
was finished she pushed it back
was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame on the driver's side of a car
softly , `` Barney ''
in her direction but he didn't answer
, `` Barney , why is he keeping me here ''
answer
to be looking at a point above the little window
, `` Why can't I call my home
some money from someone and go home by bus
send the money right back ''
the cigarette he had been smoking
it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe
looked at her
, `` I only work here ''
, `` Please ''
was back at work on a car
her head on her arms on the counter
he be kind one moment and cruel the next
know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her
he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her
was thumping painfully ; ; the unknown was so much worse than -- what dangers lay ahead for her
thing had she to face in the next few hours
and hot was trickling on her wrists

sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself ; ; as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in , she would think about something else
and father , for instance
they now
mind she followed the white Buick along the road somewhere between here and the Niagara River
attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldn't deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the Falls and took the River Road to LaSalle and , finally , turned in at their own driveway at 387 Heather Heights
would yawn and stretch and shout , `` All out
the end of the line ''
would her mother be doing right now
would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful , big , safe , solid shoulder next to her on the front seat
was in trouble and she was alone
put her hand on her husband's arm as he slid in the driver's seat beside her
were sweetly calling , were answered
chattered so that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible

that woman's apron behind the door
a wet spot -- she couldn't have been gone long ''
some sound meant to convey agreement
the car key in the lock
violently trembling
, `` You heard what he said about police
we drive around the corner ''
door crashed shut
throbbed into life
, `` I got the message
''
, `` no


comes looking for us
sit here in the car while you walk around the corner ''
car sprang away from the curb like something alive
, `` I'm not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those '' -- Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling
were spiked by barbs of graying beard
, mean eyes regarded Marty steadily , unblinkingly
were threaded by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them
chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath , Marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey
the man
driven the car that passed them on the road outside Admassy's place
Acey Squire , proprietor of the juke joint
at Squire pleasantly and said , `` There was a cab waiting for me here
know where it might have gone ''
his gum , his jaw moving in a steady rhythm
straight at Marty
not answer
the faces of the others nearest him , looked into their staring eyes
anyone see my cab ''
, keeping his voice casual
showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him
have to get back to Jarrodsville '' , he went on
see there are some cars here
if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town
happy to pay for the favor , of course ''
men stood and stared at him for a moment longer
a startling thing occurred
so utterly unexpected that Marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after it had happened
no word spoken , no apparent signal given
men all moved at the same instant
into the waiting cars , motors roared , the cars sped off
wagon and the old Plymouth headed east toward Jarrodsville
and the pickup truck sped west toward Sanford's Run
all four cars were out of sight
stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously in the sky again
great distance thunder growled and broke the silence
back toward the dilapidated house
he saw a pale face at a window
was Dora May
would be glad that they hadn't hurt him
other farmhouses nearby
road there was one no more than a hundred yards away
another on this side , a little further down
many more between here and Jarrodsville
lined the road
tall and mocking
stretched out into infinity
single strand of wire reached into the silent houses beside the red-clay road
nothing he could do but walk
was more than three miles away , down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire
east and started walking down the left side of the road
had proceeded a few feet , he paused and turned up the cuffs of his trousers , which were already damp and mud-caked
mud was ankle-deep , and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflected the murky light
approached the first farmhouse , thunder sounded behind him again , closer now and louder , like a steadily advancing drum corps
several people on the porch of the farmhouse
a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers
an instant he thought of appealing to them for help
had a car or truck and would drive him into town
realized the utter futility of the idea
staring at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared
eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious
side of the road there were two farm hands , well back in a field , leaning against a plow
too , stared at him
of thunder were right behind him now
thought came into his head
a story he had read as a youth
probably one of Kipling's tales of the British Army
an officer who had been disgraced and drummed out
roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded , and each man about-faced and turned his back as the officer approached
these poor farm people would turn their backs
by the roadside ended
dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch , too broad to leap over unless you were an Olympic star
rain had been added to the stagnant water
trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car
coming toward him
was now in sight
skipped a beat when he recognized it
the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road , the station wagon that had been parked at the Burch farm
station wagon
headed back toward Jarrodsville
only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road
and his friends were returning to seek him out
wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him , beside a fenced field
was another sound
car was coming from the west , from the direction of Sanford's Run
the Ford that had been outside Burch's farm
helplessly in both directions
a narrow road , barely wide enough for two cars to pass
not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch
two cars were equidistant from him , the station wagon started up again and the Ford gathered speed
down on him
nothing he could do except jump into the ditch
, and sank to his knees in muddy water
two cars roared by , there was a high-pitched eerie , nerve-shattering sound
how the Union soldiers must have felt at Chancellorsville and Antietam and Gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charged at them , screaming the wild banshee howl they called the Rebel yell
he stood in water , shivering and gasping for breath
turned his ankle slightly , and it pained him
, with their load of howling men , had disappeared in the distance
been two more cars parked at the farm , a Plymouth and a pickup truck
be coming for him next , bearing down on him from both directions
the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again
be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time , all the way to Jarrodsville
had three miles to go
the more affluent juvenile delinquents , who could afford hyped-up autos instead of switch blades as lethal weapons , played this same game and called it `` Chicken ''
not go through the fields
was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence
to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail fence , the section by the farmhouse
he could climb up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again
place could not be far now
go in there , climb through the window , and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest
even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected
not dare climb back up to the road
deep in water , but at least they could not reach him there
on , mud sucking at his feet with each step , until he reached the end of the drainage ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm
back to the road , and he felt utterly exhausted
, panting , for a moment
he saw something that he had not seen before , and panic gripped him again
, his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him , was made of rails , all right , but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it
on down the road despairingly , because there was no place else to go
all sense of dignity
not stand on dignity when you were soaked and muddied and your life was at stake
were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse , too , but he did not bother to look
into a dogtrot , breathing heavily , streaming with sweat
to reach Admassy's place
his only sanctuary
on both sides of the road bristled with the barbed wire
stretched on endlessly
he heard them
he saw them
was coming at him from the east , the pickup truck from the west
timed it better this time
reach him at almost exactly the same instant
stone-still
backed against the fence , one of the cars would brush him as it passed , and he would be cruelly lacerated by the wire
to the middle of the road and simply stood there , waiting for them , a perfect target
must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards
coming on at reckless speed for such old vehicles
at him
his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible
Plymouth neared , it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down
himself to stay frozen there
moved , he would be in the path of the other car
the fender of the Plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by
fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by on the other side
, insane sound of the Rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills
not leave the middle of the road
not try to run
on , his aching eyes focused straight ahead
nearing the Admassy house
going to make it , he told himself
he heard a car coming from the east , and he felt as if he would break down and weep
, no , not again '' , he said aloud
again so soon ''
a new sound , a sound as piercing as the Rebel yell , yet different
the sound of a siren
saw that the approaching car was painted white , and he began to wave his arms frantically
the prowl car from the sheriff's office
drew up alongside him and stopped
in '' , Charley Estes said brusquely
into the back seat and lay back , fighting for breath
someone in front with the sheriff
Pete Holmes , the cabdriver
around and said to Marty , `` I guess you think I'm a yellow-bellied hound
wasn't no use in me staying there
fight a dozen or so of 'em
stayed , all that I'd have got was four punctured tires and one busted head
you wait at the Burch house
known I'd gone to get the sheriff
lucky they let me go , I guess ''
was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space
was finally pointed east , he said , `` You should never have come out here alone
redneck country
in every one of these houses is a Night Rider
turned the telephone over to Rourke , and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes
talking on the phone when he came back
an hour , eh
positive ''
a moment and then said , `` Hold it ''
his head and said , `` Alvarez will definitely be in a back room at the Jai Alai Club on South Beach within an hour
try and meet him there ''
at his watch
too far from Fifth Street , and should allow him to make Scotty's Bar by midnight
with satisfaction , `` That's fine , Tim
there ''
the appointment over the phone and hung up
don't know what you're getting into , Mike '' , he said unhappily
hope to Christ
said briskly , `` Grab another drink if you want it
one other call to make before I meet Alvarez ''
''
out in the Northeast section
got my car here ''
parked in front ''
slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes
better keep on driving yours '' , Shayne decided , `` because I'll be going on over to the Beach
drop you back here to pick mine up ''
to a closet to get a light jacket , and took his hat from beside the door
gulped down the whiskey hastily and joined him , asking , `` Who are we going to call on in the Northeast section ''
lady
, maybe not too much of a lady
, I want to find out whether she's home yet or not ''
the door and followed Rourke out
car , Shayne drove east to Biscayne Boulevard and north toward Felice Perrin's address which had been given to him by the Peralta governess
drove , he filled in Timothy Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the Peralta house , and on his own surmises
want to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when Marsha makes her phone call there '' , he ended grimly
don't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not , but I want to see who takes the call ''
deal at Las Putas Buenas where the two knife-men jumped you '' , said Rourke with interest , `` that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought by the luscious Mrs. Peralta , doesn't it ''
does '' , Shayne grunted sourly , still able to taste her mouth on his in the Green Jungle parking lot
story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony
was designed to put me on the spot , it would have to have been written before Peralta ever called me in on the case ''
you think Laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's knowledge ''
haven't the faintest idea
her husband strongly suspects so , and that's why he called me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so
Felice's street ''
, peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign
see it better out the right-hand side , and he said , `` yes
the left , I think , for that number you gave me
than a block or so ''
in the left-hand lane and cut across the Boulevard divider
a small , neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet , palm-lined street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story mansions , now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments
westward from the Boulevard slowly , letting Rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers
automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side
idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he approached , and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed , indicating that it was occupied
to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke said , `` It's the next house , Mike
right ''
pulling into the curb , Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left
around the corner and parked , turning off his lights and motor
told you , Mike '' , said Rourke in an aggrieved voice
was back there
said , `` I know it was , Tim ''
was chilling and cold
you see the car parked across the street ''
didn't notice it
watching for numbers
It has a Beach license , Tim
in the front seat
a quick look at their faces as we went past
crazy as hell , they're two of Painter's dicks
named Harris and Geely
mean anything to you ''
a minute , Mike

nodded grimly
pair whom Petey is officially commending for slapping me around and pulling me in ''
are they doing here ''
stake-out , I suppose
Perrin
specific orders to see that I don't make contact with her
positive , Tim
be wrong
out and walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on Biscayne
on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there

show their hands
are Beach cops on a stake-out , they'll admit it to a reporter
no official standing on this side of the Bay
as you find out if they are Geely and Harris , come on around to the lounge where I'll be waiting ''
the door on his side and stepped out
groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel
things you talk me into , Mike
chuckled
often do they add up to headlines
complain ''
the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant
standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when Rourke came in six or eight minutes later
nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar
the bartender , `` Bourbon and water '' , and Rourke told him , `` It's those two , all right
Geely
them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin ''
happily , `` I've got it all worked out , Tim
time with your drink
it
three minutes , go in that phone booth behind you and call Police Headquarters
and don't identify yourself
that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street , and they better send a patrol car
up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address
waiting for you there ''
brought Rourke's drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar
in a low voice , `` I've got a date with a lady , Mister
pay for a pint I can take with me
how it is '' , he added with a conspiratorial wink
is dandy , but liquor is quicker and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow ''
sure don't ''
winked back at him and palmed the bill
away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to Shayne
detective slid it into his pocket , Rourke asked sadly , `` What in hell are you going to do , Mike ''
a couple of punk detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God they'd stayed out of my way this afternoon
, Tim ''
out blithely , and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink , getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police
Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south
over to the right-hand door , opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket
he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives , but its weight was comforting at his hip
side of the Bay , Miami Beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen , and Shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs
swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat
the brim of his hat low as he approached , stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the right-hand side
, paunchy man named Geely was on that side , half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door
the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night
and slid partly out , and Shayne's left arm snaked in around his neck to help him , while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big , gum-chewing jaw before Geely could straighten up
back to let him slump to the ground , and then dived over him through the open door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster , somewhat impeded by the steering wheel
his big hands around Harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway
him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp
him into the street a couple of feet away from Geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side
stir
both breathing heavily , out cold , and Shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him
the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top , sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men , and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat
, then , to look toward the lighted Boulevard , and saw Rourke's tall , emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side
across to intercept the reporter in front of the two-story house where Felice Perrin lived , and asked casually , `` Get the police okay ''

have a patrol car here fast
inside
with you ''
the two damned fools got all excited when they saw the bottle , and knocked each other out cold '' , Shayne said good-humoredly
have fun explaining that to the Miami cops
business over here on a stake-out anyway ''
up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling
of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them
one marked Perrin Aj
on the right was dark , but there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top , and they went up
two front rooms , both dark behind their transoms , and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake
nine steps above him , Roberts had paused
with him , waiting , no longer impatient , trying now to think it out , do a little planning
down over the banister at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set
could call in , they could check the story while we were on our way
have to tell them I had Roberts -- Then he heard it , like a muffled thud , felt a subtle change in air pressure
up in time to see Roberts hurtling down on him from above , literally flying through the air , his bloody face twisted
to flatten against the banister , gripped it with one hand , but Roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the groin
for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail
with Roberts , helpless and in agony , over and over , down the steps
wrenching effort , he managed to hunch and draw in , to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head
fuzzy in his mind and , for a moment , helpless on the lobby floor , but he was conscious , and free of the weight of Roberts' body
vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward , reaching
on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand
his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand
fixed on the other's feet , which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack
stiffly , forcing his knees to lock
pain in his groin nearly brought him down again
himself back off slowly , his eyes wary on Roberts , who now had no more to lose than he
dulled as he moved , and he steadied inside
moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled
on '' , he said
want to be that big a fool -- I was hoping for this ''
at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps
the razor well out to one side
invulnerable to attack , but he could be handled , Mickey knew , if he could be brought to make the first move
eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step
with slack arms
time , Roberts '' , he said
would it be easier if I put my hands in my pockets ''
was lost on Roberts
slowly , directly , giving no hint of a feint to either side
just short of arm's reach when he stopped
off two steps , forcing him to come on again
a fixed grin on Roberts' face , made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood
off again and Roberts hesitated , then came along
in a series of rhythmic fits and starts , a macabre dance -- two steps back , two steps forward , two steps back
his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door
going to be it now , any second , and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor , no matter what , even if Roberts should feint with a kick to the groin , the deadly hand was his exclusive concern
came , sudden and vicious but short
twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon
in a silver arc toward his throat , then veered downward
his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm with his own , felt the blade slide off his sleeve
could move inside to cut upward toward his face , he slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly
and slashed at him wildly
Mickey tripped and fell to one side , landing heavily on the wood floor
was on him , gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade
it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs
a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and heaved him clear , then scrambled to his feet
in the center of the lobby now
the razor , Roberts came up into a crouch , shaking his head
charged Mickey was ready
Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly , then wobbled in mid-air
right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smashed at the bloodstained face
backward , his back arched , fought for balance and , failing , stumbled against the newel post at the foot of the stairs
of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , sudden-end sound
on his side across the lowest step , rolled over once , then lay still
himself leaning against the desk , with stiff hands , panting for breath
minute he went to Roberts , looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse
feel any
to be dead ; ; if not yet , then soon , very soon
was cold in the lobby
seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do
was no more than eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning came to this : There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two -- Wister and the one who hired the two of them -- from finding out about Roberts and lamming out
law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more than that
have to
they could never catch up with the others
other way ; ; I'll have to do it myself
at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step
sure now he was dead
, he thought , nobody knows about it yet

the stairs , went into Roberts' room , found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could
a few things
have to be perfect
a wastrel
on impulse , he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry
had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room , wiping carefully everything he might have touched
him nearly an hour
to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat
the rest of his things and returned to the lobby
Roberts' suitcase near the front door , went outside and walked back to the garage
mildly surprised to find it was snowing
softly , silently , an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky
feel it on his face and in his hair
the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes
backed out and swung around to the front drive
into the hotel and searched till he found the razor
it in his own pocket for safekeeping
the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat
went back for Roberts
was heavier than he had anticipated
it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep
it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out , then returned to the porch and closed the front door , making sure it was unlocked
carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier
continuously , but quietly , evenly
reached the dip in the woods , he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible
fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground
in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine
facing it and left the headlights on , but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase , he found the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage
back and got the flashlight , returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier
the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it
dust settled , he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder
like carrying the suitcase
snow was deceitful underfoot
nearly fell
passage , he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden
time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight
looking down for a few seconds , then backed up two or three paces from the edge
too much weight casually to toss it away
feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out
be a bad place to die
a bad place for Roberts to wind up , but Roberts had asked for it
too late to worry about that
slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel
a relief to get rid of the weight
shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down
got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge
momentarily on the point of dropping off
it a strong push , heard it slide , then tumble dryly into the hole
to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit
lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor
, he decided
little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter
signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow , probably by the next day
cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact
it would be a skeleton
his way back to the Jeep
started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket
down , went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit
on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised precariously , then slid off to the ground
back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel
garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it
stains here and there and he cleaned them off , using an oiled rag he found on a nail
the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep
the flashlight where it had been stowed , got into his own car and backed it out of the garage
tire marks where it had been , but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny
, he thought , might spend some time grieving for her lost lover , but he doubted that she would launch an investigation
her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense
would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run away
in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room
answered and he decided Nancy must be at work
him not to be too hopeful and then , ignoring his own advice , said excitedly , `` But it does sound good
named Lisa who tells nobody anything about herself
picture with the same initials ''
not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm
you in a day or so ''
highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake Pontchartrain and along the coast
was ten miles inland -- more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions
into a motel and drove downtown
was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome
the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town squares , the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist's grass
his best bet was a call on the sheriff
in the outer office took him in to Sheriff Carruthers , a big , paunchy man with thick , white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office
front of the desk , Hank said , `` I'm looking for some information with very little to go on , Sheriff ''
the background of the case , ending with the tenuous clue which had brought him to Gulf Springs
swivel chair tilted back
you're looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned
was such a person , I'm afraid she got away with it
don't know more about him
the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a little later
a tedious job , but if you want to try it , the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county supervisor's office ''
the society editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride ''
an idea
has been society editor here for twenty-five years
says that marriages may be made in heaven , but weddings are made in Mrs. Calhoun's columns
one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper and all that ''

, when the editor was just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation , Mrs. Calhoun and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out beside his bed
sure to remember any bride who was vague about background
made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment
remember if the groom died later ''
up
wish you good luck , but please don't dig up too tough a case for me this close to election
find out anything , come on back here and we'll get started on it ''
Mrs. Calhoun was like trying to catch up with Paul Revere between Lexington and Concord
out that she also sold real estate , cosmetics , and hospital insurance
trek stretched into the afternoon -- from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper , where he found her at five o'clock
a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter
a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted
year
I do remember one
Rouge
man named Vincent Black
her because she didn't want her picture in the paper
like that I've seen in twenty-five years ''
reason did she give ''
she had a breaking-out on her face -- some sort of allergy -- and none of her old pictures was good enough
see her till several days later at the wedding , and her face looked like it had never had a blemish on it
of course , you couldn't see too well through the veil ''
her name Lisa Carmody ''
how in hell would I remember that ''
mind
look it up
still live here ''
think they moved away shortly after they were married
a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred
it'll be in the files
run a social note when somebody moves away ''
up and thanked her
they inherited some money or something ''
with a reportorial gleam in her eye
vaguely , `` Well , it is a little legal matter , but nothing like that ''
across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving
like what you're after '' , he said when Hank had finished
on , let's hurry down before they lock up for the day ''
basement the sheriff took him to a small , dingy office occupied by a tall , thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves
Ferrell Hirey Lindsay , chairman of the board of supervisors
is a private detective , Hirey
look up something in the newspaper files , so don't lock him in here ''
'' , said Hirey
just leave the door open
when you close it , so stay as long as you like ''
the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half
it open
don't shut this door
open from inside
built the new jail , we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded
himself a lot better than we do prisoners
a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from Hirey's air conditioner coming through the grille ''
past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big , leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls
table and four chairs stood in the center
all here , back to 1865 '' , Carruthers told him
all right to smoke , but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave
of course , you know not to take clippings ''
leave the air conditioner on for you , Mr. Ferrell '' , said Hirey
forget to turn it off and close the door good so it'll latch ''
them and promised to observe the rules
had gone , he stood for a minute breathing in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming air conditioner couldn't quite dispel
In a tour around the stacks , he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room
weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him
, indeed , all here -- almost a century
to moon rockets
pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones
volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling
was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf
it over , climbed up , and lifted out the big volume , almost losing his balance from the weight of it
over and dropped it on the table
Calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring , he started to plod through several months
to turn right to the society page in each one , but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him
he found it in the paper of April 2
him little more than Mrs. Calhoun had remembered , stating that it had been a small , modest wedding compared to some of the others
a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom
life was an open book , so to speak , from his birth in Jackson , Mississippi , through his basketball-playing days at L.S.U. and his attainment of a B.A. degree , which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for Peerless Business Machines
line on the bride said she was Miss Lisa Carmody from Baton Rouge
of New Orleans
beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr. Black
Black was who he thought she was , Mr. Black's Peerless selling days might well be over
their exodus from Gulf Springs
the search took twice as long , cutting down on his extra reading , for he had to pick through several columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue
it in the edition of May 15
said Mr. and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson , his home town -- so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago
his program was a call to the Jackson office of Peerless Business Machines to find out if Vincent Black was still with them -- or , more specifically , still with us
at his watch , saw it was only seven , and decided to indulge his weakness now
next hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder , sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen McKinley's assassination , the Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago , and the Hall-Mills trial
middle of the stock market crash , he heard a slight noise in the outer office
around , saw nothing , and decided it must be a mouse
distracted him , yet there was no sound , only tomblike silence
knew it was not sound , but lack of it
conditioner was no longer running
up and turned around to see the metal door closing
shut as he sprang toward it
his face against the grille
there ''
shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond -- enough for him to see there was no one there
heard the outer door closing
, come back '' , he shouted
it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around , figuring that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up
faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind
was stone-blind , the person who'd just left couldn't have missed seeing Hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room
if he'd somehow missed seeing him , he wouldn't have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room
was had meant to shut him up in here , had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted

his room at the motel
back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left
they could kill him just as easy right now
hear what was going on in this underground vault
heard it and smelled it -- the steady hissing , the dread , familiar pungency of gas escaping
be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors' office
, Lilac Gaylor and Lila Kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing
those minutes in her room , he had lost touch with her as a reality
and Cunningham's chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking of Lila and Lilac , separately or together , as a legend
drifting apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide
'' -- said Mr. Skyros
take a little time to think it over ''
awkward : very awkward
be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over
trustworthy
would hear about it
knew -- `` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros
too much time , because I'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away
done favors for you , big favor not so long back , didn't I , and I'm right here to take on where Pretty left off

want no trouble , you don't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros ''
, no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in
his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; ; the genial smile seemed painted on his face
-- Speak of dangerous information
too much entirely already
had Mr. Skyros at bay `` Big favor I done you
this deal o' Denny's -- and Jackie's -- kinda hangin' fire , ain't it , maybe you've been kinda worryin' over that
say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully
deal with the ace o' spades
do with an ace o' spades , bad luck ''
spades -- a widow , that was what they called a widow , these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros distractedly
that Angie knew , too
got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand -- it seemed to be a general rule
by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank , all of it , because naturally -- brothers , living together -- and Angie -- Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo's regular-featured , almost girlishly good-looking face -- or indeed anything about Angelo
was not a man who thought very much about moral principles ; ; he found money much more interesting ; ; but all the same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living -- and paid for his own stuff -- and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel-like dark eyes , and he felt a little ill
, my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure
in business so long because I'm careful
, a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , isn't it ''
a long while '' , said Angie
tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it
over to Castro and get fixed up there
wait no two weeks ''
Skyros didn't like Angie , but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come out -- And Angie such a valuable salesman , Prettyman said -- All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys -- Why did everything have to happen at once
stupidly , `` Why , you ain't turning Angie down , are you , Mr. Skyros
, we all figured -- I guess anybody'd figure -- Angie '' -- Angelo gave him an affectionate smile
Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said
O.K. , Denny , everything's O.K. Ain't it , Mr. Skyros ''
God , the name repeated over and over , anybody to hear -- Not being a fool , Mr. Skyros knew why
from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held -- you could say -- the whip hand
because of Domokous
Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause -- Of course , there was another factor
his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast
, Angie might not last long
broke out on Mr. Skyros' forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking -- hoping -- planning -- perhaps -- Good God above , had not Domokous been enough
Angelo's thin shoulder paternally
you don't want to go talking that way '' , he said
, sure , you're the one take over for Pretty , soon as I get the supply , get started up again , isn't it
need worry , Angelo
you , I know how it is with you , my friend , I sympathize , and I'll make it a special point -- a special favor -- get in touch , and get some stuff just for you
know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I'll try my best , my friend
, you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business
, he won't be around a little while , he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the Elite
, you see that , isn't it ''
, that's your business , Mr. Skyros '' , said Angie , and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window
appreciate it , you do that

none of us want no trouble
a room over the Golden Club on San Pedro , you just ask for me there , you want see me
I call you -- tonight
o'clock , I call and see if you got any
decks for me , Mr. Skyros -- and ten-twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash ''
, now , I don't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros
you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash basis , like they say '' -- `` Sure '' , said Angie
, Mr. Skyros
throw , that the deal

you the cash , say five hundred for ten decks
how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again
deal , Mr. Skyros
'n' have a look round for it ''
do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend
awkward for everybody , isn't it , we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes
do my best for you ''
out of there in a hurry , brushing past another man in the door , mopping his brow
thing -- yes , very true , one must make do as one could , in some situations
all be straightened out later
much later , but when things had settled down a little
deal with the Bouvardier woman went through
of spades
not a superstitious man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that , indeed
wished he had never got into the business , and still -- scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy money Katya Roslev , who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now , rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change
not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks
marked the few who did thank you , you didn't get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself , seeing how downright rude she could act to the others , before they'd take offense , threaten to call the manager
seldom they did : used to it , probably
who came into a cheap store like this
snatch , I saw that first
Here , I'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I don't bother with it , see
of place She'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing 'way behind
noon , and she'd never come back
to
a lot of money , enough
smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills so's nobody would suspect -- maybe couldn't get it until Monday account of that , the banks -- But that wasn't really long to wait
she'd waited so long already
say anything at all to the old woman
it all planned out , how she'd do
she didn't feel good on Sunday , couldn't go to church -- there'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn -- and when the old woman had gone , quick pack the things she'd need to take , all but the dress she'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime
Monday morning -- or it might have to be Tuesday -- get up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer
be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left , go do the daily shopping
leave a note with it , either -- or maybe just something like , Don't worry about me , I'm going away to make a better life
life

as if she wanted much
mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft -- all she wanted was a chance , where she wasn't marked as what she was
Katharine Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign-sounding names , the ones went to the same church and -- Different place , different job , different people , she'd be all different too
she'd do her hair another way ; ; smarter , and wear different kinds of clothes -- she'd be Katharine Ross , just what that sounded like
give me the wrong change '' , said the customer sharply
I can't count ''
up the amount in indifferent silence
listening to other voices , out of the future
those vaguely-imagined new , different people
Katharine's awfully nice , and pretty too , I like Katharine -- Let's ask Katharine to go with us , she's always lots of fun -- Katharine -- Soon , very soon now sixteen Mendoza didn't wake until nearly nine-thirty
going to be another hot day ; ; already the thermometer stood close to ninety
still sound asleep ; ; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag , and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom , which tasted peculiarly of face powder
a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today , and drove home
got out fresh liver for Bast , he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish
was just a trifle fatter around the middle
to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters , and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens

her severely
lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats , it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens -- and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away
suppose now that you've finally grown up , if a little late , you'd go on producing kittens every six months or so
well , it's a pity to spoil your girlish figure -- which all those kittens would do anyway -- but I think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so there won't be any more
if the Carters would take one
no good looking at me like that '' , as she wound affectionately around his ankles
nose unexpectedly wrinkled up
to be in the hall
hear you quarrel about her
well , you can't really blame Lolotte
her beau to you ''
was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door ; ; Sarah remembered it clearly
on
got to get busy
taken to her bed , with the door locked
it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you
-- She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into Sarah's hand
that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now
coffee '' -- coffee
-- cold ''
looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat
don't want it '' , Sarah said , firmly

I'll take it down with me as I go ''
up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start
door she turned back , her Roman nose looking very long now and satiric
forgot
Lucien have gone after them
like that book your Northern friend wrote -- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds ''
don't know Mrs. Stowe
they do if they find them ''
can't do anything
, childish , running after them like that
Ben so
course the paterollers won't be of any help , not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around , God knows where ''
swished away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , pour out the coffee , so no one would drink it
the so-called coffee was bad enough at best , cold it was all but undrinkable -- especially that cup
deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium
quarreled with Lucien , she had resisted his demands for money -- and if she died , by the provisions of her marriage contract , Lucien would inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office , but later , when the war was over , her father's entire estate
cold and hot , sticky and chilly at the same time
a minute , she told herself , think about it ; ; Lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee
lost a bottle of opium -- but that was on the trip from New Orleans
had taken it during her first day at Honotassa
she had missed it after her talk with Emile , after dinner , just before Emile was shot
Glendora had entered her room while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes
else could have come in , too -- then or later while she was out of the room
have been easy to identify as opium by its odor
not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to Honotassa with a formed plan to murder her
even know that she was there
certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding -- yes , and credible fool he had every right to expect
he had been surprised , unpleasantly surprised , but surprised
else
, Rev had said , don't invite danger
crawled : Lolotte had told Maude that she was in the hall and the door was open
begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall
-- or anybody -- could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium
not reasonable either
had disappeared before Emile's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah's own doubts and suspicions -- and questions
to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup
somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave Honotassa
a certain amount of logic
the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste

merely an attempt to frighten her
go back to New York as Maude suggested ; ; she wouldn't run like a scared cat
well , she'd be very careful
and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life
she left her room she dug into her big moire bag , took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken
else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died
known all along
need to break the wax seal , read the contract and find out
conceivably have wished to make sure ; ; Rev loved Honotassa , it was like a part of his breath and body ; ; Rev had stressed the need for money
never have tried to give her poison
the envelope back in the bag ; ; there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen
all likelihood , by now , there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract
no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been
downstairs and received another curious shock , for when Glendora flapped into the dining room in her homemade moccasins , Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and Glendora said she hadn't
much work this morning , Miss Sarah -- everybody gone like that '' -- Sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat
, then who brought it ''
Maude
to the kitchen and say she take it up to you ''
down a dish of lukewarm rice
much breakfast this morning
know what we're going to do , Miss Sarah ''
got to eat '' , Sarah said , curtly , because a chill crawled over her again

away
wasn't dosed with opium , indeed it had no taste at all , not a grain of salt
what she could and went out along the covered passageway , with the rain dripping from the vines
kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking chickens
a basket '' , Sarah told her
go to the storehouse ''
a chicken and a flurry of feathers , and went with her through the drizzle , to the storehouse
the right key and unlocked the door
a long , low room , like a root cellar , for it was banked up with soil , and vines had run rampant over that , too
dark but dry and cool
out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas , eggs , cornmeal , a little salt
looked emptier than when Miss Celie had shown her the storeroom , and since the men from the Commissary had called ; ; there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with
Glendora to the smokehouse , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon , hanging from the smoke-stained rafters
go hungry , not yet
fields were green and growing
you possibly imagine what life is going to be like , here ''
said

Glendora back to the house , her basket and her apron laden
for a moment , rain dripping from the trees over her head , thinking of Maude
the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah's room
the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do
see how her death could affect Maude
see any reason why Maude would attempt to frighten her
there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her
neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish
had suggested that Sarah return to New York
have shot Emile -- if she'd had a reason to kill him
no use in standing there in the drizzle , trying to find a link between Emile's murder and opium in a cup of coffee
back for the house , saw a light in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder
George and Lolotte were mending shoes
lamp stood on the table that dusky , drizzling day
all three bent over a shabby riding boot ; ; George had a tack hammer
a patch of leather , Rev steadied something , a tiny brad , waiting for George's poised hammer
, `` First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg again , is get me a Yankee '' -- `` With boots on '' , Lolotte laughed softly
up and saw her
up and stiffened
look up at all
no way to know , no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah's appearance , believing her to be drugged and senseless -- and just possibly dead
, `` Come in , Sarah
know the news ''
news , Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it
was suddenly a little fixed and questioning
to George and Lolotte
your cobbler's shop somewhere else
to talk to Sarah ''
the office , the spreading circle of lamplight , the patch of leather in Lolotte's hands
with the tack hammer , the homely , everyday atmosphere , all denied an attempt at murder
of panic caught Sarah


I've got to -- to see to the kitchen
-- Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in Rev's face
did I do that
as warm , drizzling rain touched her face
no schoolgirl , refusing to bear tales
reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself ; ; if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien , her husband
be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love , but it was marriage
couldn't choose Rev as a confidant ; ; it must be Lucien
that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it
at the kitchen door , caught her breath , told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen , where Glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude was cleaning lamp chimneys
a gulp
Sarah , I can't cut up no chicken
say she won't ''
homely , everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her -- or to murder her
everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency
what had happened or hadn't happened , somebody had to see about dinner
the chickens with , if she had known it , something of Glendora's dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs
since last night
think there was any reason to ''
there isn't
him again anyway
to some of the fellows he works with , friends , anyone
find out how happy he is with his wife , whether he plays around with women
try looking into his wife too

think Black's the one we're looking for ''

he might be '' , Conrad said grimly
again he might not ''

says he was in his office all day with her yesterday
to make sure
it's just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn ''

you later ''
you ever going to go home ''
sure as hell doesn't look like it , does it
you , if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to , they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off ''
to tell that to the next corpse you meet ''
up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench , massaging his right leg
at his watch
ten minutes before eleven
how long it would be before they had a signed confession from Lionel Black
experience let him know , even at this early stage , that Black was his man
still wanted to know why
a cold , windy day , the day after Kitti's death , but Stanley Gilborn paid no attention to the blustery October wind
Conrad , Gilborn had no destination
walked , not noticing where he was , not caring
automatically at the street corners , waiting for the traffic lights to change , unheeding of other people , his coat open and flapping
walked , he tried to think


what Conrad had tried to make him believe
nothing coherent about his thinking
a succession of picture-images passing through his mind : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence , in no logical succession
of what Conrad had told him made it impossible for Gilborn to accept , with any degree of realism , the actuality of it
had intellectual meaning for him only
they penetrated him not at all
was and your wife were intimate
Conrad's exact words
sense and yet they didn't
Conrad had told him the truth
so
wasn't so
so because it couldn't be so
was alive -- and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm -- she had been the center of his life
the sun , he the closest planet orbiting around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed
years he had lived , progressing towards a no-goal , eating , working , breathing without plan , without reason
come along to justify everything
his goal , she was his reason
lived all his life waiting for her
, in the time that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility , not once , not for one one-thousandth of a second , of her infidelity
not consider it now

he walked , aimless again
ended , inevitably , right in front of his hotel building
began to nod his head automatically , then remembered who Gilborn was , what had happened to him the night before
at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity
by him without seeing him
the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts
apartment itself , all was still
were no longer there
no evidence that anything was different than it had been
Kitti wasn't there
off his coat , he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door
, sitting there , in the familiar surroundings , the truth began to sink in

no anger towards Kitti , no sense that she had betrayed him

all he had , everything he had , everything he wanted
taken her away from him

is a left-hand entry in the ledger , there is a right-hand one , he remembered from his school days
is a victim , there is a killer

was and your wife were intimate
from the chair , took off his coat
he went into the bedroom
still showed signs of where Kitti had lain
there for a long time
at the bed unblinkingly
was empty now
lie in it no more
lie in it no more
whether Kitti had lain in that same bed with Who
minutes , Stanley Gilborn stood there
end of the half-hour , racking his brains , thinking over and over again of Kitti , her friends , her past , he left the bedroom

think of no answer
on his coat again
, he took one last , lingering look at the apartment
he would never see it again
street , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley Gilborn was a lone figure
Jacobs , Kitti Gilborn's death had a quite different effect
, Kitti's death was a source of guilty , but nonetheless soaring , happy hope
defense , it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope
had asked her , she would have described herself only as nervous and worried
on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter
whether Stanley would call
to be with him , to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed
skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out

she was feeling sick , both from concern about Stanley and hunger
he called
she reflected , even men like Stanley , are unpredictable
to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't so many after all
was quite predictable
one of the things she liked about Stanley
like so many other men
last night , for instance
the movies had been fine
taken her upstairs to say good night
invited him in for coffee
in the kitchen , as she was watching the kettle , waiting for the water to boil , that he had grabbed for her
, without giving her a chance to prepare for it
, he had put his arms on her shoulders , turned her around , and pressed her to him , so close she couldn't breathe
she apologized for the long scratch across his face , tried to explain she couldn't help herself , that the panic arose in her unwanted
hadn't understood
left , she knew she would never see him again
like that
always predict what Stanley was going to do , ever since she first met him
that one morning
he walked in to announce to her , blushing , that he was married
she was going to die
assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him
remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion
it was sometime during the second week she worked for Stanley
nothing that he said or did , but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him , looking forward to his eventual proposal
thirty-one years old then
was already considerably concerned over her daughter's future
had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother's continued carping , had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony
, it was only a matter of time before Stanley would propose
to be expected that Stanley would be shy , slow in taking such a momentous step
along in life , she knew , convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman
result , he never looked for it
day , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having to tell him , that there was such a woman in the world ; ; a woman who was willing to give him love , faith , and anything else a woman could give a husband
there was a woman who , unasked , had already given him love
Blanche loved Stanley
, unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement
first day , Blanche literally thought she was going to die , or , at the very least , go out of her mind
have been easier for her if Kitti Walker hadn't been everything that Blanche was not
thirty years younger than Stanley , taller than Stanley , prettier than Stanley had any right to hope for , much less expect
have married a score of men
no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley Gilborn , there was no need for her to marry Stanley
come into the office , on somebody's recommendation , because she needed help in preparing her income tax return
filled out the return and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely asked Kitti to join him , never expecting her to accept
all this because the door to Stanley's office was open and , without straining too hard , she could hear everything that was said
gone out , saying he would be back in an hour
come back for over two
day , Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened
mornings when Stanley came in late , afternoons when he left early , days when he didn't come in at all
something must be causing Stanley's new , strange behavior but she never once connected it with Kitti Walker
too unprecedented
six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office , Stanley announced he and Kitti were married
Blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations
the two of them left for a week's honeymoon in Acapulco
were away Blanche came into the office every morning , running things as she had always run them for Stanley , going through the week in a dazed stupor , getting things done automatically , out of habit
one week , she was able to continue in this manner
morning of Stanley's return , however , her strength left her
of watching his serenely happy face , listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures , and Blanche had to leave
away for ten days
days were like no others that Blanche had known
she stayed in bed
tell anyone , even her mother , what was wrong
to have a doctor , insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her
'' , said the fingerprint man
, if you're going to believe those prints , you'll have to look for a killer who's a top-grade piano player ''
by playing an imaginary piano , doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack
it clearer he shifted to acting out , but with no change of manner , the killing of Rose Mallory
snatched at an imaginary bucket , swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball that's been bounced hard
same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that , pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that
moving like a ballet dancer , playing for laughs
Mallory's killer acted this way , catching up with him was going to be a cinch
him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined in his hair
Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment , we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness
you will remember , was still New Year's Day
time Felix turned up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up , it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats
the exception
retained his hat and his horn , and , whatever fun might still be going , he was ready to join it
incidentally , might give you some idea of what Felix was like
, he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning
boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy
wagon , therefore , was not out in front of the house any more , but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings
, furthermore , the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance
yourself in Felix's place for a moment
taxpayer , householder , landlord
away from home for the New Year festivities , but now the party is over and you come home
in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not yet eliminated from the system , you are sober
have your paper hat and you're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper hat and , in addition to anything else you may be , you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back yard
too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr. Average Citizen
your paper horn clutched in your big , craggy fist , and for your entrance you have planned a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants
your house a focus of public and police attention
imagine yourself forgetting under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn
could be startled into forgetfulness
your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door
yourself and ask him what's going on
answering you , he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs
the upstairs guy '' , he bellows
owner
send him up ''
turns back to you
on in '' , he says
tell you what's cooking ''
, as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable , official control , could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand
getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix's being an odd one
his handiwork out in the back yard , and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a little special
not , however , prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as Felix came up the stairs
of course , must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him , but , nonetheless , I did find his reaction startling
was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he'd forgotten about them , he now remembered
bounding up the stairs and joined the dance
the hat , lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a flute , and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him
stopped dead and glowered at Felix
his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house
a bull of a man
big-chested , big-shouldered and heavy-armed
was ruddy and heavy and unlined , and when he laughed he showed his teeth , which were big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown
remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures
had receded most of the way to the back of his neck
only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short
almost as white as his teeth
man of his mass he was curiously short
a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure
with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five
it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement
was just this side of being a freak
till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him
dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's country weekend
sports jacket , lighter gray slacks , pink flannel shirt , black silk necktie
were clear
freshly shaved , and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter
a whiff
subsided
''

'' , he said merrily
, the happy one ''
much Latin we remember '' , Gibby said dryly
always live up to your name , always like this , always making happy ''
try '' , Felix said blithely

noticed that it improves things any ''
for you '' , Gibby said
the rest of your name ''
rest of it
all there is ''
there ever was ''

one could never have looked happier
more than joy
ecstasy
lovely whorls '' , he chortled
intricate , so beautiful
along
fingerprints ''
prancing along the hall , heading for the next flight of stairs
him back
here because of what happened last night '' , he said
, yes , but important
is important , for the record let's have the full name ''

Grubb ''
, not bothering to whisper

can't see what would make it necessary for you to know

lowered his voice

but not for years
it's been just Felix
I did after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially changed , and this is something I don't tell everybody
almost forty years ago ''
that he was a man of about sixty , he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible
a broth of a boy , our Felix , and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit
him up the stairs
would gather up Connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting
think we didn't need Nancy and Jean , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were through with this case
if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood
, if in our present group , would certainly be interested in knowing that much , and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation , there might always be some way
can possibly avoid it , you don't hand out any extra chances
us into his studio
that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house , where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope
angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades
first opened the door on it , all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night
fixed that , rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others
about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience
his movements was tentative
no process of trial and error
the room completely blacked out , as it was when we came in , he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare
more-than-average wacky , I was surprised by what we found
no display of either works in progress or of finished work
there on work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it
might have been mad , but there was no telling
all completely shrouded
was solid and heavy and in good condition
orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman's comfort , convenience and efficiency
tools about but they were neatly kept
no confusion and no litter
sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins
not see the newspapers the next day
his staff -- he suspected it was Ed Thornburg -- intercepted them and for this Andy was grateful
fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule , a crutch he rarely used , and didn't awaken until early afternoon
him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach
window bloomed a beautiful summer day
same sun was shining upon little Drew also , and those who had kidnapped him

still a very big world , despite all the modern cant to the contrary
sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door
dozing , perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten
to alertness at Andy's entrance
, Mr. Paxton

people waiting to see you , though ''
''
own people
the show tonight ''
up the telephone
I let them know you're awake ''
suppose
, do you know ''

better
plenty of guts , Mr. Paxton
me to call her ''
expecting me to ''
his head so Andy told him not to bother
reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted
not manage the former or expect the latter ; ; they had nothing to give to each other
might look peculiar to outsiders , but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances
little time to himself , anyway
afternoon sped toward evening , the suite saw a steady procession of Paxton aides pass in and out , each with his own special problem
with the writers
spent the morning revising the act , eliminating all the gay songs , patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations
lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified , as befitting the tragic circumstances
reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed `` Cradle Song '' in case it was needed
was back and forth on several occasions , first to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement -- they decided it was wise -- and later to announce that a prominent comedian , also an agency client , had agreed to fill the casino's open date
Bake slipped in , pale and drawn , last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it
if there was anything he could do
a job to keep him busy , sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute arrangements
Rocco Vecchio , they heard nothing
it was time to depart
nosing about , spotted reporters in the lobby , so Andy was hustled away quietly through the hotel's service entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere
in eluding the curious at the hotel , but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub
was surrounded by a mob
the parking lot , making progress by automobile difficult
he reached the protection of the stage door , Andy was recognized
his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire
around him , fingers pointing , eyes prying
not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night's hero-worshippers
come not to admire but to observe
worse inside '' , Thornburg informed Andy
jammed in every table he could find
heading of it's an ill wind , et cetera ''
tomblike by contrast
kept their distance , awed by the tragedy
his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read , `` We're with you all the way ''
signed by everyone in the troupe
help but be touched
Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board
waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently
that this had been no small accomplishment
looked better ; ; any kind of job was better than brooding
him , `` Bake , I wish you'd talk to Skolman , see if some kind of p. a. system can be rigged up outside
barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get a table
want him to miss the message ''
try
going to like it much , though , giving away what he should be selling ''
the only one who didn't care for Andy's scheme
time later , Lieutenant Bonner stomped into the dressing room
got a bone to pick with you , Mr. Paxton
damn loudspeakers ''
up the revised script he had been studying
about them ''
going to louse me up good
have been here all afternoon , setting up for this thing ''
that , with the nightclub's cooperation , the police had occupied El Dorado like a battlefield
cameras had been installed to film the audience , the reservation list was being checked out name by name , and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead
it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose
want you to have the speakers taken out ''

like we're never going to see eye to eye , Lieutenant
tell you what I wanted the p. a. system for ''
, I know
such a long shot '' -- `` No longer than yours
you expect to get tonight , anyway
somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces
a sign on his car that says , ' Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper ' ''
the script in his fist
can't stop you from doing what you think is right
try to stop me , either ''
'' , Bonner said , `` you're going to ask us for help
hardly wait ''
you don't understand is that I'm asking for it now ''
departed , still full of ill will
gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination ; ; he had to cling to routine , tested procedures
otherwise would be to admit his helplessness
admit or not , Bonner was helpless
showed too much planning , the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist
was scheduled for eleven o'clock
for a half-hour longer , hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the ransom money
Shirl Winter , on separate telephones , could not reach him at any conceivable location in Los Angeles , nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts

sweaty bastard's probably halfway to Peru with our money by now ''
one smiled , he felt constrained to add , `` Just kidding , natch ''
in to advise , `` Andy , Skolman's sending up smoke signals
ready ''
he complaining about ''

drinking , aren't they ''

a bunch of sippers out there tonight
nobody wants to pass out and miss anything ''
in a lower voice but Andy overheard , `` They act more like a jury than an audience ''
, `` Well , I guess we can't wait any longer
you stick by the stage door
shows up during the number -- or you hear anything -- give me the signal ''
said , `` I'll stay on the phone , Mr. Paxton
couple of call-backs I can work on ''
a sweetheart -- but leave one line open
try to phone us ''
into the corridor , their `` good lucks ''

what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different , as if he really needed it
right
, cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon , had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone
had nothing of the polish , pace or cohesion of the previous night
luck would normally step in
was no ordinary show and Andy knew it
sang well or badly had nothing to do with it
had come not to be entertained but to judge
had changed him from a performer to a freak
framework , what followed was strained , even macabre
patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy
was as depressing as a gravestone , the applause irresolute and short-lived
plowed ahead , mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning , and gradually his listeners warmed to him
grew more fervent ; ; the evening was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show but for him as a person
was yet to come
reached the finale of his act , a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings
-- a perspiring , haggard Vecchio -- was standing there , flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards
nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held
his heart thud heavily with relief
at Fox to cut off the finale introduction
died away discordantly
a deep breath
and gentlemen , in place of my regular closing number tonight , I'd like to sing something of a different nature for you
if you please -- the ' Cradle Song ' ''
rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience
he blame them
song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste , callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency
choice , he plunged into it , anyway , holding onto the microphone for support
and goodnight
voice shook
first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest
if the audience would let him finish
; ; though contemptuous , they were still polite
he was finally through , their scorn was made apparent
tentatively then quickly stopped
the silence was complete
lights came up , Andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit
off-stage
God '' , he muttered
God ''
there to support him
okay , Mr. Paxton
here , all of it ''
moment , all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo
you hear them
know what they think of me ''
of damn jerks '' , Hub growled
needs them ''
his arm
, Andy , it'll be all right
that can't be mended ''
were hollow
, better than any of them , that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty
king's horses and all the king's men Vecchio shouldered in
got it , Andy
how , but I got it
believe the places I've been today
had to sign your life away , you'll probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go for , but '' -- Andy nodded dully
doesn't matter , Rock
our part ''
that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room
congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent ; ; the place had the air of a morgue
no desire to linger himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them
watched until he got as far as the hall , almost out of sight , then hurried after

wait ''
up with the old man in the living room
Arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door
this one favor , Dad
tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours ''
not ''
man gave the room a stare in leaving ; ; under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory
the truth ''
Bartlett girl was killed by Mr. Dronk's son
Ferguson have been across the street , talking to the kid
some sort of new evidence , a bundle of clothes or something , and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime
you accept facts
kids were together a lot , they were having some kind of teen-age affair -- God knows how far that had gone -- and the kid's crippled
, and the man who hit you and took the cane , he limped
, how much more do you want ''
looked him over closely
sound like an old woman
have gone to work today , 'stead of sneaking around spying on the Dronk house ''
, see here '' -- `` The trouble with you '' , old man Arthur began , and then checked himself
Arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits
man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight
enough time to go into it '' , he finished , and slammed the door in his son's face
turned from the window draperies
found something else up there '' , she said half-aloud to the empty room
took it away , overalls or something ''
restlessly across the room , then back to the windows
they've gone , they didn't come back , and they didn't arrest that Dronk boy ''
frowning and chewing her lip
wearing a brown cotton dress , cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer , a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below
the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows
on earth did I send him off to work
excuse enough to keep him home that young Mr. Arthur's still over there ''
energy , she went to the phone and rang Holden's office and asked for him
think you had better come home ''
, we're so busy
been on everybody's neck , an order he expected didn't come through and he's '' -- `` I don't care
you here
alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous
someone to go out and find out what's happening ''
I couldn't do that , even if I were home ''
grew high and trembling
can't be underfoot every time those cops turn around
think I did something ''
see the grin that split her mouth ; ; the teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark's
just have to risk it
wander along in the dark , can you
that you even more than I would be wondering what they're up to
some clothes '' , she tossed in
''
she ignored the yelp
, that Mr. Ferguson was here
he wants to ask you some questions
him off
expect you until five ''
I'd better wait until five ''

right away ''
the receiver into its holder and stepped away
were bright with anticipation
office , Mr. Holden replaced the phone slowly
from his chair
to cough then ; ; he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face
his hat out of the closet
moment he thought of going into Crosson's office to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a pounding in his head , that he decided to let it go
the receptionist in the outer office , muttering , `` I've got to go out for a little while ''
call Crosson if she wanted to , let Crosson raise the roof or even can him , he didn't care
into the car
key into the switch , pressing the accelerator with his foot , putting the car into reverse , seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body
in the street , the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken
turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home , he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes , sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears
earth was in Mae's mind , that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing
she think he could do
to ignore what his own common sense told him , but it wasn't possible ; ; her motives were too blatant
him to get into trouble
the police to notice him , suspect him
going to keep on scheming , poking , prodding , suggesting , and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions
knew in that moment , with a cold sinking of despair , a dying of old hopes , that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors
, open ; ; but enough
some suspicions to repeat to the police
inner thoughts cringed at it , he forced himself to think back , recreating the scene in which Mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child
amounted to anything
been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions
scene flashed before his mind , the interior of the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled to meet him , the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light
cops somehow got hold of that
it hadn't been what it seemed , he'd had no idea the girl was in there
touched her
he came to examine the scene , there was a certain staginess to it , it had the smell of planning , and a swift suspicion darted into his mind
, of course
have plotted a thing like that
just that little accidents played into her hands
murder
on the wheel , clutching it , staring into the sunlight , and tried to bring order into his thoughts
light-headed and sick
no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare
his wife
married to him for better or for worse
be wilfully planning his destruction
was

the conviction of truth roared through him , shattering his last hope of safety , he was reaching to release the hand brake , to head up the road for home , doing her bidding
, and the road wobbled , familiar scenes crept past on either side
to a stretch of old orange groves , the trees dead , some of them uprooted , and then there was an outlying shopping area , and tract houses
the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide
couldn't imagine where
really no place to go , finally , except home to Mae
gate he slowed , looking around
beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there morosely ; ; he didn't even look up
on the steps of the little office sat old man Arthur ; ; he was straight , something angry in his attitude , as if he might be waiting to report something
on the gas
idea drifted in from nowhere
go to the police
tell them his fears of being involved , he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him -- the scene was complete in his mind at the moment , even to his own jerkings and snivelings , and Ferguson's silent patience
throw himself on the mercy of the Police Department
what Mae would want him to do , though
sure of this
had abandoned himself to the very worst , once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense , there wouldn't be very much for Mae to do
moment , Holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about
be such a relief
that old sign , supposed to be painted over a door somewhere , Abandon hope , all ye who enter here
Holden said to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight , I'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be
, they've lain awake nights , they've shook at the slightest footstep , they've pictured their own destruction , and now it's all over and they can give up
they're giving up hope
hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension

a hand at the empty street
see you go
into the paved space before the garage and got out , slamming the car door
up and down the street
car had been in sight , Holden would have walked directly to it
to the front door and opened it and looked in
the room from the hallway to the kitchen
a cup of something steaming , coffee perhaps , in one hand , a fresh piece of toast in the other
there , watching Holden come in , and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth
'' -- `` I've been thinking '' , she said , swallowing the toast
you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage
them that time you painted the porch at our other house
you wiped up some grease ''
caught him off guard , no preparation , nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster

minute
you '' -- `` I've been looking for them , and they're gone
they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago
yesterday
to paint in them , and then you just took them for rags
have them now ''
don't remember any overalls at all ''
were all faded
at the knees ''
sipping and chewing and watching
paint , wasn't it
I'm not sure of the color
had them ''
, sit down
the cup of coffee
what this is all about ''
her head
another bite of toast
almost absently how she chewed , how the whole side of her cheek moved , a slab of fat that extended down into her neck
goodness , you ought to remember if I do
to have to go to the police and explain what happened
the truth or something before they come here ''
coldness entered Holden's being ; ; his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like , liable to break like an icicle at any moment
never owned any painting overalls
with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs. MacReady
the eyebrows more like this ''
had finished with that , he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else , most probably a busboy
to look like him now , would you say
the mouth , huh
this , maybe ''
dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the Hotel Dumont and blew it off again , and did the same in a tiny , almost airless room in a tenement in the West Forties
also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms , sucking dust up once more
the Third Detective District , Eighteenth Precinct , had the longest , the most tedious , job
Hotel Dumont there had , at the time in issue , been twenty-three overnighters , counting couples as singular
, as one , Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne , who had checked in a little after noon the day before , and had not checked out together
Willings was not included ; ; he had been at the Dumont for almost a week
, of course , no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel
( or twenty-two with the Paynes themselves omitted ) provided merely a place to start , and their identification was the barest of starts
and addresses listed , verification came next
take time ; ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble some water
I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been
Boston
he's in '' -- ) The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems
Arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want -- heaven knew didn't want
lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and , at odd hours of night , drive from smaller stations to distant homes , probably through rain or , in November , something worse
Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont
Arthur had fifty-four overnighters , again counting rooms rather than people
overnighters out
find what was wanted , as was most likely , check out other guests , with special -- but not exclusive -- attention to those with rooms on the street
active enough can reach a roof , wherever his room may be
know , while all this went on , that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel
not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel
other roofs , less convenient but not impossible
dull business , detecting , and hard on feet
also the one salient question to ask , and ask widely : Did you notice anything out of the way
for example , a man carrying a twenty-two rifle , probably with a telescopic sight attached
, of course , no hope it really would be that simple
, whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent , would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder , whistling a marching tune
anything that might hide a rifle
suitcase
fat suitcase , for that matter
that , from room clerks , from bellhops

, it appeared , long enough to attract attention
say , for musical instruments
at the Dumont
the King Arthur
was staying there
been for a week

all
that
Pearson , Eighteenth Precinct , thought for a time he might be on to something
bin at the Dumont turned up a florist's box -- a very long box for very long-stemmed flowers
oil on green tissue
to check
: sorry

at all strange
a man had tried , at the King Arthur , to register with an ocelot
Dumont , a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair
King Arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged , and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches
also been a man who must have had St. Vitus or something , because he kept jerking his head
dribbled in , William Weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head
in
no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at her house on Nod Road , Ridgefield , Connecticut
was modern , large , on five acres
cost plenty
cops would check from time to time ; ; pass word when there was word to pass
this news into the centrifuge
out , damn it
the next move
forget motive for the moment

actually with Payne when he was shot , or who had left the party within not more than five minutes ( make five arbitrary ) positively had none
; ; Hathaway , Jerry's publicity director ; ; Livingston Birdwood , producer of Uprising
been with Payne when he was shot , could not therefore have shot him from above
Willings
left after the scuffle ; ; had been seen to leave
have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey
seriously , therefore
, then -- hunches which felt like facts
ambush , certainly ; ; Willings undoubtedly had
, presumably , a better than average shot
hunch , now -- Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four
if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , tougher , than anything else that went on two legs
laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger
had had to `` go on '' from the party and had , presumably , gone on
checked out further

motive is a part of fact
his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction
do not keep that well in a sane mind
had accomplished much in a quarter of a century
now to correct so old a wrong
his head
he thought , I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun

left the party early , pleading a headache
of opportunity , presuming she had a gun
, conceivably , have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase
on the Payne luggage
might now have taken it away again
her husband wandering
unreasoning jealousy
it happened and hell knew it too
it happened , almost always , among the primitive and , usually , among the very young
it mentally young ; ; call it retarded
was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was primitive
not move in primitive circles
young , but not that young
to Bill Weigand that he was , on a hunch basis , eliminating a good many
himself that all eliminations were tentative
reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities
, mother or son , or mother and son
obvious

too , the cause to hate lay well back in the years
had more cause to remain , even increasingly to corrode
boy , particularly
had , apparently -- if Mrs. MacReady was right in what she had told Mullins -- only in recent months been forced to give up college , to work as a busboy
man he blamed for this made much of -- youth and bitterness and -- Bill picked up the telephone ; ; got Mullins
out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on '' , Bill said

do
named Lars Simon , playwright-director , had expressed a wish that Anthony Payne drop dead
say , of course , that he had not really had any such wish ; ; that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say , lightly , meaning nothing
would turn out to be true ; ; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say
named Blaine Smythe , with `` y '' and `` e '' but pronounced without them , had been fired at Payne's insistence
also , if Pam North was right , a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne's than she , now , was inclined to admit
deny the latter ; ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things , or any connection of either with murder
have to be given the opportunity

evident that Mullins was the man to go
evident that a captain should remain at his desk , directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat
was good and tired of the wall opposite , and the crack in the plaster
keep the firm seat ; ; let Stein
cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins
Shadow , on Pam's bed , appeared to be one cat -- rather large , as Siamese cats go , and , to be sure , having two heads and two tails
other hand , they , or it , seemed to have no legs whatever
said , `` Hi '' , to her cats , and added that proper cats met their humans at the door
dark brown ears , one twitched slightly at this
right '' , Pam said
know it isn't dinnertime ''
this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats , stretching
the more talkative , began at once to talk , her voice piteous
a more direct cat , leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen
surprised , wailed , and trotted after her
it isn't dinnertime , two waving tails told Pam North
not , whatever tale was told by tails
would cope
be firm
most unlikely that she would be firm
to be fat cats , Pam thought , and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together
time , it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble
feeling that Anthony Payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was , in any event , reprehensible
Constable's explanation of her confidence , so uninvited , been a little thin
more like a thought , but not a great deal more
tall dark boy , carrying trays too heavy for him , found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more than he could bear
himself -- how
a rifle and killed
she had no answers ; ; had only a hope
kid -- the poor , frail kid
have luck and some have no luck and that , whatever people who prefer order say , is the size of it
, unlucky -- The telephone rang
, to her surprise , that she had been almost dozing
o'clock in the afternoon
for lunch -- that was the trouble
to remember

remember
-- `` Hello
this is she

had music in it
words coming too fast , they came on the music of the voice
said I would '' , Pam said
won't talk about who gave the information
they have to
, Mrs. Constable
they have '' -- She was interrupted
this a cry for help '' , Faith Constable said
a door conveniently unlocked '' , Madden supplemented
damn door '' , said the police chief
gift horse to be viewed with suspicion ''
face wore a meditative look
there was collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later
makes a very poor red herring for an inside job
to break a cellar window ''
forget , there was the hope it would pass for a natural death '' , Pauling reminded him
, with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation ''

pane of glass isn't hard to '' -- The telephone interrupted him
up the receiver and said , `` Police chief '' , into the mouthpiece , and then , `` Oh yes , Mr. Benson
hoping I'd hear from you today ''
free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened , saying , `` Uh-huh '' and `` I see '' at intervals
he said , `` Well , thank you for calling , Mr. Benson
was no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one I'm glad to have it made official ''
up
'' , he said to Madden
just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs. Meeker apparently died from suffocation ''
at his notes
minute hemorrhages in the lungs ; ; particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils
the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities
cause of death apparent
of mucus and foreign objects
for thrombosis , clot or hemorrhage
of these , no gross hemorrhage of lungs , heart , brain or stomach ''

about it
the time of death
of the digestive process varies , the pathologist says , but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that Mrs. Meeker died several hours after her seven-o'clock dinner
midnight , give or take an hour either way ''
again
there it is '' , he said
your problem , of course , unless Johnston and the murderer are one and the same ''
this possibility
it was , Pauling said , he couldn't limit himself to it
to look for other prospects , other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to Johnston came to light
with his investigation centered on the fraud , said that tomorrow he would go to the Bronx bank through which Mrs. Meeker's checks to Johnston had cleared
had to be located , they agreed
have been in collusion with Johnston on the fraud ; ; he might be Mrs. Meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death
Madden's suggestion ; ; the police chief shook his head over it
Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder , then he too had another identity
the Medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about Johnston

doubtful
that he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs. Meeker
asked to use the phone and called Brian Thayer , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o'clock
that he would see him at two and made another call , this one to Mrs. Meeker's lawyers
was out for the day , but Mr. Garth would be free at one-thirty
tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a concession for which Madden should be duly grateful
that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers
lunch with Pauling
one-thirty he entered Hohlbein and Garth's elegant suite of offices in Medfield's newest professional building
Garth on sight , conservative clothes and haircut , smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties , handclasp too consciously quick and firm
on the make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions ; ; that Mrs. Garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer ; ; that there were three children , two boys and a girl ; ; that she was active in the Woman's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; ; and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day
that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth
prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker had only seen fit to consult Mr. Hohlbein or him about it
not being able to find fault with so true a statement
to see a copy of Mrs. Meeker's will
one out
, October 8 , 1957 , immediately caught the inspector's eye
recent '' , he remarked
she in the habit of making new wills ''
no
reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death
had grown considerably
to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most ; ; particularly the scholarship fund
time the will was drawn Mr. Hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age , knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth ''

Hohlbein and I have noticed some lapses since , though
them this past year , I'd say
or three years ago I doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston affair
consulted us , you see
did before , and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised ''
nodded , doubting this
hadn't struck him as ready to seek anyone's advice , least of all Garth's
sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons
have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs
back to read the will
over the millions that went to Meeker Park , Medfield Hospital , the civic center , the Public Health Nursing Association , the library , and so on , pausing when he came to the scholarship fund
were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker's lifetime , and the proviso made that as long as Brian Thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees ( hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate ) he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail
vote of confidence in Thayer , Madden reflected
too
for him
on to personal bequests , a list of names largely unknown to him
to each of the great-nieces in Oregon ( not much to blood relatives out of millions ) ten thousand to this friend and that , five thousand to another ; ; to Brian Thayer , the sum of ten thousand dollars ; ; to the Pecks , ten thousand each ; ; to Joan Sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in Mrs. Meeker's employ at the time of the latter's death
additional five thousand for each year after Joan's twenty-first birthday ; ; Mrs. Meeker hadn't got around to taking care of that
bad , Madden thought
had earned the larger bequest
was left twenty thousand , Garth ten
no other names Madden recognized
might well have been included , he felt
had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death , and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers
up this point with Garth , who shrugged it off
people have their idiosyncrasies ''
one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more
, she had a number of them where money was concerned '' , Garth said
we'd have trouble persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions , and I've known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet ; ; the next moment she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate Johnston affair
no telling how she'd react to spending money ''
next about the audit of the scholarship fund
an annual audit , Garth informed him
or shortages had ever been found
was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator
had reached the ten thousand mark
ran another four or five thousand
didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party -- Thayer , like himself , Madden reflected , was the extra man so prized by hostesses -- and found him easy enough to talk to
didn't play golf , didn't seem to belong to any local clubs -- his work took him away a lot , of course -- which probably accounted for his tendency to keep to himself
began to flicker to his watch
that he had already told the police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended Johnston to Mrs. Meeker
offer no theory to account for her murder
thing , his manner conveyed , was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug
Mrs. Meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing
, Madden's dislike of the suave , correct lawyer deepened
be all right with him , he decided , if his investigation of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth's door


glance , not much of a motive for a man of his standing ; ; but for all his air of affluence , who could tell what his private financial picture was
knew as he left that this was wishful thinking
he made a mental note to look into Garth's financial background
had a downtown address
in an apartment house not over three or four years old , a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business district
a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor , using the second bedroom as his office
bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , rugs , and draperies
a professional decorator , Madden thought , and somehow as impersonal , as unremarkable as its occupant
the rent would run close to two hundred a month ; ; in Medfield , perhaps twenty-five less , not all of it paid by Thayer , who could charge off one room on his expense account
Madden into the room he used as an office
a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchairs
open at stock-market reports lay on one of them
it up and offered a drink
declined
the interview , he asked if Thayer , with more time to think it over , could add to what he had said the other day about Johnston
his head
all I think about , too
her death
unbelievable that it was murder
her domineering ways , I can't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy ''
, Phil , are you trying to wreck my career
what you're doing -- wrecking it , wrecking it , wrecking it ''
confronted Hoag on the building's front steps -- Hoag had been permitted no further -- and backed him against a wrought-iron railing
had built up as he made his way here from the second floor , helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed
, `` I didn't send for you , Leigh
the captain in charge
he ''
, for God's sake , go away
in there
you there's nothing between Midge and me , nothing
in your mind ''
of sobs escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state
, I'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment ''
, get a grip on yourself
about you or Midge
some security information about the prime minister ''
at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes
about me
it , Phil
pull my leg , old man
get you on the platform this morning ''
not pulling your leg
call that captain ''
use , he won't come ''
closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness
happened to your head ''
was hit -- knocked out
you get him ''
says I'm to take the message ''
at Hoag drunkenly
hit you in the head ''
doesn't matter
back to the captain and tell him this : Somebody's going to take a shot at the prime minister , and Mahzeer is in on the plot
under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with Mahzeer ''
, `` That's impossible
ambassador ''
it's true ''
''
trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it
show you how wrong you are
the prime minister are alone right now ''
triumphantly
that proves it ''
terrified
are they ''
you expect , the john
''
is that ''
us , two flights up
old man , you can't go up
even let you in the front door
don't you be a good boy and '' -- Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders
to me , Leigh
want to spend another day in the State Department -- another day -- you get in there and tell that captain what I told you ''
out the words
you know I can do it ''
placating hands
does it , Phil
just going
my way ''
and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back
second landing he paused to look for Docherty , didn't see him , and accepted a glass of champagne
several large swallows , recollected that Docherty had gone up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him
Hoag was , no telling what he might say or do
his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing
top a uniformed officer blocked further progress
, what is it ''

want Captain Docherty ''
Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him
, `` It's okay , Bonfiglio , let him by ''
toward each other
''
, `` Hoag told me to tell you '' -- he waited until they were close ; ; it was hideously embarrassing -- `` not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer ''
half-crocked to the captain ; ; it would be just like him
not ''
claims Mahzeer's in a plot to kill the P.M. ''
taut : was it possible
ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared
, he thought ; ; the prime minister knew who his enemy was here ; ; he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter
by some wild chance Mahzeer was the man , he wouldn't dare try anything now -- not after Docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well
damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck
muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away
this had to be checked out
your friend Hoag get his information ''

the faintest , Captain ''
you mind sending him up here
to talk to him ''
he continued along the corridor , poking his head into the next office for a careful look around
had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building
unwilling to rely on Griffith's carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act on it
was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street
have to do something on his own

opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs
lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps
the early departures ; ; in half an hour the reception would be over
was planning to set up the prime minister for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes
the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building
with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories
second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; ; the scene looked like a Christmas card
third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; ; it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible
be Mahzeer's office
the prime minister would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer's desk ; ; they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting
minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; ; Mahzeer would stand up , the prime minister would follow
direct the prime minister's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side
shot would come ; ; Hoag would carry its sound to his grave
of course , would be desolate
he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance

the street
Muller waiting with the rifle
buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf
them could be eliminated ; ; Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite
was generously set back from the building line ; ; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere
shot come from a roof
his eye along the roof copings ; ; almost at once a figure bulked up
glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman
cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building -- if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La Guardia Airport
the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk
side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window , but he saw no faces ; ; the room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain
the latter were true
rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades : one was a club -- that was out ; ; two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted
three , possibly four , one looking much like the next
the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule
closed it again
assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; ; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance
on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule
wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes ; ; there were six apartments

on the mailboxes meant nothing to him
senseless -- he had no idea what to look for
in the boxes themselves ; ; all were empty except one , and that one was jammed with letters and magazines
of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days , and not likely to return on a Friday
made the same deduction
attracted to the lore of mailboxes
the inner door ; ; the cooking odors were stronger -- all over the city , at this hour , housewives would be fussing over stoves
, as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flights to the third floor , pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade , all that remained of the building's beauty
on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead
was certain : the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys ; ; fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open
been shut again , but the lock was broken ; ; he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch
he to do now
thought no further than finding Muller
now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find him -- that Muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag's control
not break in on an armed man
have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop
time
were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door
open the door : at the far end of the long dark room Muller was faintly silhouetted against the window , the rifle still raised ; ; he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill
his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , dismissing Hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at Hoag's apartment
his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch : evil flourishes in the dark
was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second shot came
nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ; his face wore a look of outrage
caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ; a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table
dead before his body made contact with the floor
back into the hall , leaned against the wall , and started to retch
Docherty sent Arleigh Griffith for Hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before Griffith returned , buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne
at Ingleside District Station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to Captain Harris's office ( to the left ) , the lieutenant's office ( farther along and to the left ) and the janitor's supply closet ( straight ahead )
is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries , a hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards , a stack of unsold Policemen's Ball tickets from last year , and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps
the captain's fifth of Hiram Walker inside the safe before he reported to Lt. Killpath , though he knew that Killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on Herman Wolff's gift
more a matter of tact , and also it was none of Killpath's goddam business
up to the lieutenant's office , leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun that was occasionally tried out on the Academy Range
at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes
the Lieut ''
wagged his head toward the captain's office
to the connecting door , which was open , and stood at attention while Orville Torrence Killpath , in full uniform , finished combing his hair
sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded , and as Killpath raked the comb through it , it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull
eyed Gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head
alone , Gun thought
Sam Schaeffer , fight with the whole damned Bureau
me alone
looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man , and I'm going to get him
just leave me to hell alone , Lieutenant
through half-closed lids at his reflection , thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced
for Killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window
stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel , though it was obvious to Gun that Killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair
before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room , including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons
one thin leg up , clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut
the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of Killpath defying his ulcer
his chin on his kneecap , stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block , and stared wordlessly at his sergeant

bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut , closing in the assembled day watch
Orville intoned through his hawk nose , `` We can't have people running in any time they please , Sergeant ''
, sir ''
in , running out
it
confusion and congestion ''
back in the chair , knee locked against stomach , his beady eyes fixed on Matson
silent again , possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom
being called
his throat
, `` You were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago , Sergeant
getting all the juice out of the orange , now is it ''
, sir ''
smiled
that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time
platoon commander , Lt. Rinker , was calling out the beat assignments , but Matson couldn't make the names mean anything
called the station at three this morning '' , Killpath's nasal voice pronounced
you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time ''
Vaughn , sir ''
, now , you're just guessing , Sergeant ''
thinly , savoring his joke
if I said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen ''
, Vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief
have '' -- `` He let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper
not regulation , is it ''
, sir ''
you didn't know a thing about it , did you ''
forward ; ; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again , frowning now
not taking one's command with a responsible attitude , Matson ''
himself that the old bastard was a fool
was no consolation when it had rank
was out in the district , sir ''
, yes
have heard ''
a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk
might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped ''
up a white sheet of paper , dark with single-spaced data
pulled into the driveway outside the window
it was Car 12 , the wagon , returned from delivering Ingleside's drunk-and-disorderlies to the City Jail
some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail
at the report in Killpath's hand , sure it was written by Accacia -- just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand
in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again , wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then , eying the report as it lay before him on the desk , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six '' -- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses `` -- failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered
you to say to that , Sergeant ''
the paper across the desk , but Matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it
''
didn't think Accacia knew so many big words , Lieutenant ''
his lips
Accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer
think his diligence mitigates your negligence , Matson ''
, hell ''
his breath a moment , pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat

have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot , if I'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district
bad I didn't call you , and it's too bad I let Schaeffer use Accacia when he could have had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure
not one damned bit sorry I went out to question the people I know in the places they hang around , and '' -- `` Let's not push our patience beyond the danger line , Sergeant '' , Killpath nasaled
shouldn't like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty ''
, his hands balling into fists at his sides
his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out
with Orville Torrence Killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range
forward again , rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee
just remember , Sergeant , that we must all carry our own umbrella
station can't run smoothly , unless '' -- He interrupted himself , looking around Gun at the doorway
, Lieutenant Rinker ''
, Orville
you hadn't come in yet ''
been here for some time ''
up , cocked his head and eyed Gun coldly
sergeant is just leaving ''
come as no great surprise to Matson that the hot water in the showers didn't work , that Loren Severe had thrown up all over the stairs , or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes
the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in Killpath's office
as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office , he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks , not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out
he gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about Killpath's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders
didn't want to talk about it
acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night , Killpath would just have to go out and drag Gun back by the heels once an hour ; ; because he'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain
doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes , remembering then that he'd left them at the Doughnuttery
pick up another pack on his way home , if he were going home
before he started across the oiled road to his Plymouth , parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station , he knew that he wasn't going home

nine o'clock in the morning : the hour which , like a spade turning clods of earth , exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night
at this hour was populated by a whole community that Gun could not have seen on his tour of duty -- the neighborhood that had known Urbano Quintana by day
Phillips had purchased the Alliance Furniture Mart seventeen years ago
professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will , and the name was written in gold in foot-high letters across each of the two display windows
right window , at eye level , in smaller print but also in gold , was Gonzalez , Prop. , and under that , Se Habla Espanol
took a razor to Gonzalez , Prop. , but left the promise that Spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish clientele would be welcome
no problem anyway ; ; Mr. Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission Street
the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising , Mr. Phillips had no worries at all , and he said as much to Gun Matson , who sat across from him in civilian clothes , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour , $79.89 nothing-down special
honest as the day '' , Mr. Phillips said , and added , `` Mr. Gunnar , I can say this to you : Beebe is a little too honest
tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down
plan is a mere convenience , you understand , and when '' -- He interrupted himself , smiling
put her in lamps
I don't lose so much ''
don't you just hire somebody else ''
says she has to finish a story ''

asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow , but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go ''
some comment , but his mind was busy as he considered the man
was George Needham and he , too , had come from a good family
perhaps thirty-two , nicely set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave
always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools and a proper university
child , he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke
he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest was gambling
went through Casey's mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all
had understood that Betty had been engaged to a boy named Barry Jenkins
grown up with young Jenkins , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice
to ask her about Jenkins now , but he knew he couldn't do so in Needham's presence
, still wondering and a little perplexed , he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding
did you pick him up ''
, I've known him quite a while ''
at her companion fondly
I , George ''
been after her for years '' , Needham said , `` but I've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days ''
eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched Casey's hand
I tell you a secret
to get married
approve ''
his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about Needham , who was eight or ten years older than the girl
whether Needham was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from Betty's estate to subsidize him
this showed in his face , and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand
a point of frowning , of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor
have to give it some thought '' , he said
wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable , would you ''
a face at him and then she laughed
course not ''
get my references in order '' , Needham said , and though he spoke with a smile , Casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused
by any time , Casey ''
up and touched the girl's arm
on , darling
really serious about working on that story , I'd better take you home ''
them go , still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check
went out he told Freddie the dinner was perfect , and when he got his hat and coat from Nancy Parks and put a fifty-cent piece in the slot , he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry
took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car , and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment
mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if Jerry Burton's car was still there
, he did not think about Jerry Burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him
, when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem
where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over Burton , the pillow , the sheet of paper on top of it
was striding across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note
Look in the wastebasket
the only way I could beat you was to play possum , but it was a good try , kid , and I appreciate it
stood near the wall next to the divan , and the instant Casey picked it up he knew what had happened
papers inside were sodden , there was a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct
the basket down distastefully , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof
remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to Burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself
second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself ; ; then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought expanded , the implications jarred him
longer mattered that Burton had outsmarted him
thing was that Burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket
gun was empty
his mind had rounded out the idea , he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver
them with brooding eyes , brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution
: `` The crazy fool '' , half aloud
the shells on the table , as though he could no longer bear to hold them
: Where the hell could he have gone
I find him
no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room , his imagination out of control
to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered up enough to get some sense
only intended to scare the blackmailer , whoever he was , in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough
of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton
as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly
'' , he said
''
''
Calenda ''
the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head
heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon ''
took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank Ackerly
picture ''

took a picture of me at the corner of Washington and Blake about three thirty this afternoon ''
says so ''
of my boys ''
that much
not the sort who walked around without one of his `` boys '' close at hand
''
my trial coming up in Federal Court next week I wouldn't want that picture published ''
says it's going to be published ''
wouldn't even want it to get around ''
circumstances Casey was a little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken
, he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly
, however , he was still too worried about Jerry Burton , and the gun that had no bullets , and the story Burton had told him , to care too much about Tony Calenda
were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice
'' , he said
was hired to take a picture
it
I know about it and that's all I care ''
you'd better tell the guy who hired you what I said ''
tell him ''
right '' , Calenda said , his voice still quiet
I meant what I said , Casey
picture gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it , I'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you ''
do that '' , Casey said
be sure to send your two best boys , Tony ''
up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create
as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found Jerry Burton's home number
it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up
the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon
was told that no one had seen Burton since then , he thought of three other places that were possibilities
he got the same answer and in the end he gave up
time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down
done all he could and that was that
Burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk
Casey , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible
have stayed here and watched Burton

made a mistake

telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink
did he decide he didn't want one
opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too
went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes
just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again
snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent

know me but I know you
want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can
hurry you might beat the headquarters boys ''
the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision
the years he had received many such calls
them came from people who identified themselves
because he had done them a favor in the past
they expected some sort of reward for the information
passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break
occasional tip turned out to be a phony , and , like the police , Casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time
in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from Columbus Avenue
a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements , and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes
not bother with his radio -- there would be time for that later -- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned
car had pulled up behind a small sedan , its headlights still on
pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl , and watched Elaine rapidly spin from one station to another , tune in the null , then draw in a line on the chart
out just a little too far
90 degree straight for shore ''
in , raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw Elaine
''

quick '' , she replied
you drop the anchor ''
, swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where he picked up the anchor
and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the Aj
'' , Elaine said , then peered through the loop of the RDF and waved to Poet
later she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean floor
the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore
her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the engines , and started the auxiliary motor
up from below , wearing new bathing trunks
tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously
if Elaine had bought them , but he said nothing
he suddenly realized , was saying anything
as if they were all under a spell
be an excited conversation , for somewhere , directly below them , was a treasure lost for more than four hundred years
of chatter there was a null , like on the radio direction finder
in New York , he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine
all been laughing , joking , when suddenly the engine had failed
had screamed
had prayed
fallen into a complete silence , listening to the wind whistle over the wings
had been good
the plane on a small airstrip in Connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had coasted to a stop , everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment
been tension in the plane during the silent descent ; ; a tension similar to the one now
the plane there was a concrete reason for it
at this moment , there should be none unless skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe
existed
taut-nerved relationship as there had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat
over them like a cloud , its arrival as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun
Elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit , Poet behind her , Nick trailing behind him
back a cushion over one of the seats , unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it , then presently straightened , holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand
softly as he looked at the gun
''


are the best ''
the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion
are the most efficient ''
the deadliest '' , Poet commented as he buckled on his tank harness
do you need an arsenal ''
, apprehensively , staring at the weapon
quite possible there's more than codfish down there , man '' , Poet replied with a short , nervous laugh as he held the harness for Elaine
later , moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins , she picked up the gun , handed the knife to Poet , then rolled off the transom of the boat , back first
to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion
and they were out of sight , leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts
while Nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles , wondering which set came from Elaine
close together , their air trail wiggling like serpents traveling side by side
bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean surface , and he rolled over on his back
hands behind his head , he stared at the blue sky
nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean
must have enjoyed being alone
the ocean , probably the loneliest spot was the desert
uncle had stuck to this desire for aloneness , he probably would still be alive
wanted money wanted money to roam through the deserts
wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in Las Vegas
an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the Trinidad
hadn't stumbled on it
three weeks prior to the charter of the Virginia , Graham had been snooping around the San Luis Rey Mission
helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and Nick raised up to watch it heading south
a hell of a note , he thought
couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them
character flying that thing had gone over San Clemente Island yesterday he would have had an eyeful
the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat its way into the wind , headed on a tack toward San Clemente
a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small ground-swell , a lone fisherman in the chair aft
was right in the middle of the Deep
stories that the two best fishing spots in Southern California were over the La Jolla Deep and the Redondo Deep , two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline
geologists had warned , the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and no more La Jolla or Redondo Beach
fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers
fish exploded as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure
he wondered , had Elaine wanted him along on this trip
skindive , he couldn't run a boat , except on the open sea
up , stretched , looked around for the bubbles , but could see none
to the galley , he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated , poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom
the hi-fi , he went back to the cockpit , stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music
Poet returned together , popping up over the transom almost like dolphins breaking water
up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern
luck ''

his head , sliding his face mask up on his forehead
right on the edge of the Deep '' , Elaine said
her face mask , she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern , then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water
is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile '' , she added as she swung her legs over the transom
news ''
a thing ''
her a towel , then repeated the service for Poet
''
her head as she slipped out of her harness , but Poet nodded
still hung over the stern of the transom , but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in
on his foot caught on the moulding , throwing him off balance
smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat
''
hissed distinctly from Poet's lips as he struggled to his feet
became rigid
he saw Poet in a brilliant glare of horror

was still creased in pain as he studied the underside of his arm
murderer
toward Elaine , Nick saw that she , too , stood in shocked surprise
silence was too silent
of the charged atmosphere , Poet raised his head slowly , looking first at Elaine
caught the implication of the oath
was frozen into the mask of a mannequin , her body absolutely motionless
Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine , himself and Poet
first , so quickly that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction
you need a bandage ''
steadily
his arm
like banging a shin '' , he said , his eyes lingered on Nick's face , then moved back to Elaine
like hell for a second , then it disappears ''
get some ointment ''
and started toward the companionway
walk was too steady , too slow , telegraphing her fear
it
Poet
a cat , he leaped back , swooped up the spring gun and , whirling , pointed it toward the cabin
same instant , Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man
fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke of an old steam engine
same instant , Elaine screamed wildly , the sound ending abruptly as Nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic , struggling Poet
the sea closed over Nick , some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic
murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage
flippers on Poet's feet gave his legs incredible power , driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over
the captured , arms pinioned to his side , and he twisted convulsively trying to escape
escape , Nick thought grimly , because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water
would not let go
and glass face mask slipped from Poet's forehead , bounced painlessly off Nick's chin , then disappeared
again and Nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank , ripping off the skin
split second , Nick relaxed his grip and Poet's slippery body spun completely around before Nick could stop him , holding him now from the rear
at the side of Nick's head as they rolled around and around
stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water , not rising , not sinking
pain lanced across Nick's chest and a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs , joining dozens of others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising into the sky
, snake-like object swayed eerily in front of him , spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head
hose was free
struck Nick like a blow
Nick flashed one hand up , catching Poet's neck in the bend of his elbow
same instant , he grabbed the loose , writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece
exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose
the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden , wild exultation
this was a signal , Poet abruptly began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water
Nick held on , sucking on the hose , inhaling the air that belonged to Poet
not fighting Nick now
sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam
rich village but not much for action -- too many solid residents , not enough tourists or working stiffs
the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run manslaughter -- about seven months ago
Moore looked his same hick-self ; ; a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age
he said with real surprise , `` Well , well , ain't we honored
the head of County Homicide up for this murder
climbed fast , Jed
last summer and now it's Inspector Jed
19 years to become Chief of our three man police force
college education pays off ''
was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth
guess it helps '' , I said , paying no attention to his ribbing
could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop , Jed
only young but well , you don't even look like a police officer
with narrow shoulders and that brush haircut hell , you'd pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set
day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law , big and tough
when my 275 pounds and six-four comes along , why it's the same as another badge
say move , a guy moves ''
worry about my being tough , Moore
it's far too early in the day for corny lines like the bigger they come You've had your gassy lecture , let's get to work
the murdered woman Mrs. Buck ''
, nice sort of woman

fair-sized farm
the Harbor as a bride and Don't worry Jed , this one is in the bag
the killer , have the only road off the peninsula covered ''
, passed your road block as I drove in '' , I said , sitting on his polished desk
dressed like a slob , he kept a neat office
, what happened ''
nine this morning Mrs. Buck phones me she's having trouble with one of her farm hands -- money trouble
named Tim Williams -- only hand she has working for her now
with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from the South last year , but Tim and his wife settled here
no trouble with him before , thought he was a hard worker , hustling around to get a full week's work
Julia asks me to
Julia ''
on , Inspector , look alive
, the deceased '' , Moore said , slipping me his smug , idiot-grin again
asks me to come out at once
didn't sound real alarmed you know , like there was any immediate danger
there at 9:47 A.M. , found her strangled
have come sooner if I'd known
about Tim being the killer -- I have a witness
why the County had to send anybody up here
I can handle this ''
, seems you have a nice package , with all the strings tied

collar Tim before night ''
your witness ''
had -- has -- an old Indian woman cooking for her -- Nellie Harris
last of the original Island Indians
in the kitchen , had just come to work , when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room
recognized his voice , that Tim yelled , ' It's my money and I want it '
rushed out of the house
heard Julia phone me
on with her house work -- until I found Julia dead
you say it , Nellie ain't near strong enough to have strangled Julia
doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck
: Tim's disappeared -- on the run
no way off the Point except through my road block
want to see the body -- have her up the street in Doc Abel's office ''
see it ''
up Main Street to this big white house , then around to the back
Harbor's sole doctor , Abel was also its Medical Examiner
was on a table , covered by a sheet
was busy up front with some of his live patients
the sheet , I examined the bruises around Julia Buck's once slender throat
had killed her
any prints ''
shook his big head , seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body
said , `` Never noticed it before I mean , when she was dressed but for a woman her age , Julia had a real fine figure ''
the sheet , glanced at my watch
almost one and I hadn't had lunch
I wanted to get this over with , had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office
him , `` I want to go see the Buck house ''
''
down Main Street , I said , `` I saw the Harbor's one squad car at the road block , we'll ride out in my car ''
, we'll use mine '' , Moore said , opening the door of a sleek white Jaguar roadster
slid in beside him he said , `` Some heap , hey
heck of a buy on this , dirt cheap ''
, it's a real load '' , I told him , looking up the street at my battered Ford
minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house , and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow
a garage and a modern barn in the rear , all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes
gentleman farming , the kind of grandfather-father-to-son folding money the Point is known for
of a Caddy were sticking out of the garage , while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture
wasn't old , she was ancient -- a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune
also stone deaf in her right ear
repeated what Moore had told me
asked , `` Why didn't you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was ''
gal stared at me with her hard eyes , said , `` She didn't call
the living room last
up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom -- way I always do in the morning ''
you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about ''
wages
was a hard woman with a dollar
when I asked her to put me in Social Security , so's I wouldn't have to be working now , Miss Julia threatened to fire me -- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her ''
you hear Tim return ''
sir
until Chief Moore ''
on the kitchen table with my pencil
Buck have any men friends ''
''
mouth laughed , revealing astonishingly strong , white , teeth
never see none
I wasn't her social secretary ''
she on friendly terms with other members of her family ''
have no family -- around here
a son -- killed in the war ''
into the living room
seem to be any signs of a struggle
Moore , `` Where does Tim's wife live ''
take you there
, this is an open and shut case and I have to relieve my men at the road block soon
come on ''
80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks
summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these
were empty , except for a cottage across the road
Williams was about 21 , with skin the color of bitter chocolate , and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers , she was startlingly pretty
of their place was full of new furniture , five bucks down and a buck a week stuff , but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home
was both sullen and frightened
she didn't know a thing -- Tim had left the house at six in the morning , as usual
seen him since
Mrs. Buck owe him any wages ''

, for this week , but they wasn't due 'till Saturday
Mr. Inspector , no matter what anybody say , my Tim didn't kill that woman
a good man , hard working
as a bull but gentle as a baby
he angry , Tim wouldn't hurt a woman
in his life took a hand to a woman or '' `` We'll get him soon , see what he says '' , Chief Moore cut in
your husband have a car ''

us an old station wagon
for the job ''
a silly question : `` You've no idea where your husband could be , now ''
her head
she was lying
there , staring at her for a moment -- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty
, `` Come on , Jed , I have to get to my men ''
way out I told her , `` If you should eh just happen to see your husband , get him to give himself up
a fair trial
like this won't get him anything , except more trouble , or a bullet ''

him -- if I see him ''
it back to the Harbor in less than four minutes
not to act scared
could really barrel along
Moore I was going to eat , get some forms filled out by Doc Abel
said , `` If I don't see you when I return , see you for certain at my road block , Inspector ''
a bowl of decent chowder , phoned the Doc and he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl -- in a half hour
pipe , I took a walk
is a big yachting basin in the summer
, there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock , an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater
a 34 foot Wheeler with Chief Bob's in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock
a new boat , about five years old , but fitted with fishing outriggers and chairs
an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moore's
, `` You bet
is plumb crazy about blue fishing ''
into the doctor's office , picked up my forms
was walking back to the Police Station , which was in the same building with the City Hall and Post Office , I saw Mrs. Tim Williams sneaking into the back of my car
moved gracefully , she was clumsy at it
into the front seat
' hiding ' on the floor of the back seat , the soft curves of her back and hips -- rousing lines
out of the Harbor , turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped
a few minutes and she sat up
moment we didn't talk , then she began to weep
, `` I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim ''

saw him so anxious before '' , I said , lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette
course , it could be because this is his first murder case
where Tim is , don't you , Mrs. Williams ''
on the cigarette slowly , sitting slumped against the back seat ; ; didn't answer
police have dropped the case
you to go to Pearson City and find out why -- first-hand stuff for your modern crime series
same train Diana Beauclerk took and get there at the same time
the same hotel and occupy the same suite -- 1105 ''
the hotel rent it so soon after the crime ''
not
have finished with it
the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper
hotel people , you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite ''
, they may not want to rent it ''
your headache
, keep your eyes open ''
what ''
growing more and more skeptical
police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a fine-tooth comb
people will have scoured and vacuumed it
one , it's even been redecorated ''
always a chance they may have overlooked something '' , returned the chief
betting on that chance
bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk
topography of the suite
local color
Beauclerk did
imagine you're going to be murdered yourself -- between eleven p.m. and one a.m. the night you arrive ''

way to spend an evening ''
thought wiped the smirk from his face
the murderer should return to the scene of the crime ''
eyes gleamed
softly
is exactly what I'm hoping for
, the murderer is still at large
key to the suite is still missing ''
train Alec refreshed his memory of the Beauclerk case by reading teletype flimsies -- spot-news stories about the crime sent out by the Pearson City Star , a member of the Syndicate Press
was a second-rate actress living in New York
ago she had gone west to Pearson City
, her divorced husband , lived there
the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce , Kimball and Stacy
Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight to the Hotel Westmore
the junior partner of her law firm , Martin Stacy , and asked him to call at her hotel that evening
time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she remarried
Stacy , she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask Forbes for the lump sum
that it would bankrupt Forbes , who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture
he left her suite at nine forty-five p.m.
in good health and spirits , but still determined to get the money from Forbes
saw Stacy leave
visitor inquired for her that evening
she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a Colt revolver in her brain
the medical examiner , she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m.
was locked and the key was missing
the gun
finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk
motive and Stacy had opportunity
motive for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case would be solved
Westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in Pearson City , and definitely second-rate
impression of the lobby was gloomy , Victorian dignity -- black walnut and red plush , a black and white tiled floor , and Persian rugs
the night clerk as a man measures an adversary
like the room I had the last time ''
, sir ''
was young and limp , with a tired smile
you recall the number ''
was 1105 ''
smile congealed
suite is taken ''
went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk
number 1105 stood one word : Unoccupied
glance followed Alec's
have better rooms vacant now '' , he babbled
and more comfortable
same rate ''
was dark , blunt , and sulky
looked impertinent and he could look dangerous
looking dangerous now
his voice
wrong with the plumbing in 1105 ''
a sudden stillness in the lobby
, who had been chattering like parrots , were struck dumb
, lighting a match for his cigar , paused until the flame burned his fingers
bellboys on their bench were listening
eyes flickered
course not ''
with a contagious disease been in there ''
''
was almost hysterical
just that -- well , 1105 is being redecorated ''
don't believe it ''
on the desk , holding the clerk's eyes with his
you tell me the real reason '' , he drawled
might be a story in it ''
''
with the Syndicated Press , Feature Service
get the story -- or I get the suite ''
blackmail and the clerk knew it
is no story '' , he piped tremulously

gentleman to 1105 ''
persisted as Alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator
feel eyes on his back
it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly
on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet
, crimson carpet muffled every footfall
end of the corridor Alec noticed a door marked : Fire Stairs
a neat setup for murder
unlocked a white door numbered 1105
was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window
snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow , languid as falling feathers
boy switched on a ceiling light
looked normal and even commonplace
no hint of a violent struggle now
with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store
rug was suspiciously bright and new
never been stained with blood
and towels were clean , ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches
over the bureau was a blank eye , round and innocent
the part of an innocent tourist
there anything wrong with this room ''
''
dropped his eyes
you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut ''
raised his eyes
, mister
want my advice , pack up and take the next train back to New York ''
you on duty here two weeks ago ''
hesitated
`` I'm not talking
wouldn't spend a night in here for a million bucks ''
in a hurry to get out of the room
him a tip and let him go
Alec examined the doors
three -- one leading to a bathroom , one to the hall , and one to the room next door which was immovable -- locked or bolted on the other side
the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table
just quarter of nine
ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover
like the dust that collects in an unused room , but white
use white face powder nowadays , he recalled
pink , tan , or cream powder
into the bathroom
the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands
clean now , but Alec decided against a bath
into bed and switched off the light
darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window
as steadily as a metronome -- on , off -- on , off
than five minutes Alec was asleep
knew just what woke him
he was wide-awake
no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall
still , listening to the silence , watching the light
the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes -- midnight
the medical examiner she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m.
a faint sound
seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest
sound was inside the room
his eyelids droop and breathed heavily , feigning sleep
was coming nearer
shadow fell across the illuminated wall , distorted and indefinable
neon sign faded out , the shadow disappeared
neon sign flashed on , the shadow was still there
to an impossible height , climbing the wall to the ceiling
that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light -- in this case , the window
tensed his muscles , ready to jump
betrayed him with a creak
vanished
moved beyond the range of the light from the window
, Alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch
could snap it on , a stinging blow caught him in the ribs
out blindly with his right
a thick , squashy crack of fist on flesh
grazed his knuckles
everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be
rasped his fist
a grunt , curiously inarticulate , like that of an animal in pain
shook the floor as it dropped
a moment , on guard

groped for the light switch
rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room
bare floorboards a man lay face down
a short , heavy , powerful body
him over and discovered a round , lumpy face with narrow , slanting eyes -- a primitive Tartar face from Russia or the Balkans
shoes were too pointed , his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist
a slight bulge under the left armpit -- a shoulder holster
removed the gun
familiar with this type
seen it in the lineup at Police Headquarters in New York , in Broadway night clubs and Seventh Avenue pool rooms , in the criminal courts
was surprised to meet it here
had no connection with the underworld
gunman would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a
he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country road
eyelids fluttered
his eyes
are you doing here ''

made no reply
were dazed
were bruised and swollen where Alec had hit him
you kill Diana Beauclerk ''
an indignant denial , but there was no response at all
, come on , snap out of it
turn you over to the police ''
was getting on Alec's nerves
opened his mouth , but no words came
curious , animal grunting Alec had heard during their fight
you speak English ''
opened his mouth wider
pointed toward his gullet
forward to look
hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was mutilated
time I shall get to the distressing actuality , to Red McIver and Handley Walker , to murder and sudden death
realize , I am sure , how much old deeds incite to new ones , and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones
in 1814 that Abraham Wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house on Dogtown Common , a desolate place even then
sharpening his razor
'' , said he `` do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven ''
answered , `` I don't know , but I hope you'll never do such a thing ''
tremor , `` God forbid ''
, and went out and cut his throat in the cave near Granny Day's swamp
this to do with the present
I assure you
know what gets into people , even such as Red and Handley , before you can tell what comes out of them
learned , both of them , about Abraham Wharf
I beg you not to forget him
is not laid
Handley , God help them , knew the old Dogtown lore ; ; and I knew they knew it , for I'd told them a lot of it
it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows
gentlemen , I am getting to the point , to my point
the facts ; ; they are set forth in your own newspapers
from me the story , but a story is about ' why ' and then , perhaps , about how
when ' you know ; ; yesterday morning
I am trying to tell you is the ' why ' -- that is my point -- and that concerns the spirit of the matter
an inwardness and a luster to old furniture ( look at that mahogany highboy behind you ) which has a provocative emanation , if I may say so
too , have their haunting qualities

point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter
hold the spirit of a thing , then somehow you know the truth -- you know a fake antique from the real thing
truth is what you've come for , is it not
Dogtown is one of those places that creeps into the marrow as worms get into old wood , under the veneer
, all the folk who lived on the back of Cape Ann , they are not just like others
different hall-mark on them
no witch burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family
of old Granther Stannard who pulled the teeth of Dark Younger ( her real name was Dorcas ) , and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass
he was never known to run or even walk fast
is the only deserted village in all New England that I know of
sits , a small highland , with towns like Gloucester near by ; ; but now it's the most lost and tortured place in the world
lived in that desolation of rocky deformity took on some of the moraine's stony character
it is the last spewings of a great glacier , but one rather feels that only a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended , ominous life in them
up there later
a mile from here where we sit
one single dwelling left there , though once , in the early eighteenth century , there were close to a hundred houses
myself have identified about sixty sites , from the old maps and registers
pursuit , I assure you
I can remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars , and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man
now a sweep of boulders and ledges , with oak , walnut and sumac creeping across the common , and everywhere the ruins and the long , long shadows
setting , and a sinister one
that in your reports
for so many things
McIver and Handley Walker lived nearby , almost as near as I do
at Lanesville , and from his house he could be up on the Common in a half hour's brisk walk ; ; Handley lived further on , at Pigeon Cove
find one or other of them up around Dogtown sketching
both painters , ( They were

one say
, anyhow , Dogtown Common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only Sunday picnickers still stray up there , from time to time
railroad , lack of water , killed Dogtown
dead as a brass door nail , and I sometimes feel like the Sexton , for I'm about the last to be even interested
Red and Handley well
said , they were both painters
, separately , to Gloucester some twenty years ago -- there's always been an artists' colony somewhere on Cape Ann -- and each married here
cousins , Anta and Freya Norberg
a lot of Scandinavians in this neck of the woods , and many still make painted furniture and take steam-baths
among them , with blonde hair and pert faces
Freya and Red , of the red beard , married Anta
was because of an old Norberg inheritance that I got to understand them all so well
ended in a ridiculous draw , but I must tell you about it
yes , I'm quite sure it's important , because of the Beech Pasture

that's what gave me the feeling , gave me as-it-were the spirit , the demoniac , evil spirit of this whole affair
, besides being custodian of antiquities , I am also registrar
I don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things
as well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries , where the live wind blows , and not from the hull
got to know both
the water-line interests me also
was saying , I've known all about the old records , including the old Norberg deed
years ago that page was torn out , I don't know by whom
years ago , Handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered register
courteous and casual about it , as though it were of no consequence
like that , in spite of being a big man
you see him , you'll notice his habit of fingering , I might almost say , stroking a large mole with black hairs on it , by his right temple
sensual man , but very courteous , some would say slick
glossy black hair
outside manners , to my taste
the sort who , with an appraising eye , would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her
gentleman , I feel , would do neither
worn a broad-brimmed hat , and I've noticed , in my small study at the Society , that he rather smells of cosmetics
week , cousin Red wandered in as casually , but curt and untidy
small and fine-boned , like ivory-inlay
asked to see the same page
told him someone had torn it out , he shouted
God , it's that damn Handley , the sneak ''
in the same week they both came together to examine the register
were alone in the building -- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other days -- for they began to abuse each other in the foulest language
out his tawny beard , Handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair
bristled
et le noir
both
was morose , yet that day the dapper Handley was the louder of the two
my presence , they would have been at each others' throats
quarrel I learned what the trouble was , from the accusations each hurled at the other
Pasture had suddenly become valuable
fine granite quarry there , and granite's coming back for public buildings
knew it was in the Norberg family holdings , but to which of the cousins did it belong , Anta or Freya
I knew almost exactly what the will had said
with a preamble , of course
that the judge of probate of Essex County , 1785 or 1786 , appointed three free-holders of Gloucester to divide and establish the Norberg estate
usual Honorable Sirs , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased Salu Norberg , one lower room , on the Western side , privileges to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar ( I can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one Cow Right , and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower , namely the Beech Pasture
remember that the whole of the privileges , not counting the Beech Pasture , was valued at twenty pounds
you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring coxcombs when I told them that obviously the pasture belonged to their wives jointly
scene , ridiculous as it was , remained in my mind
picture of bad blood , to be further heightened with illicit if buccolic colors , for on a subsequent day I saw Handley escorting Anta , Red's wife , up on Dogtown Common
it would be inopportune to disclose my presence
I intentionally go unperceived , but the boulders up there are very high and I am a small woman
cause of jealousy between them I must tell you

unkempt as Red McIver was , he was much the better painter
Handley knew it
had a show at Gloucester , Handley would hurry to hang his pictures in Rockport
say this has little pertinence , but , gentlemen , remember that all this prepared my mind , alerted my intelligence
touches the pattern takes shape
call these the motives of crime
call them the patterns of life , perhaps even the designs of destiny
all this knowledge I had nothing of substance to unravel our case , as you would call it , till yesterday
ago , on the 20th of October , was the opening of the gunning season in Massachusetts
to shoot , but there are a few pheasant
too , if you care for them , which most of the folk around here haven't the sense to appreciate
than they have the sense to eat mussels
the day Red was said to have gone away
, he'd talked about doing so
, he often disappeared , from time to time , -- off to paint the sea , aboard a dragger out from Gloucester
his wife , never seemed to mind
these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with Cousin Handley
I wasn't surprised , early that morning , to see Handley himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back Road
he didn't have his gun , which he should have
have been a good excuse for his being there at all
had been up there by seven o'clock , after mushrooms , since there'd been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as Sandwich glass
the man had said
doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary , tear-filled eyes
no ready answer , as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing
man drunk or crazy or both
new-found buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count , and the man's eyes were still clear
is off his rocker , Haney thought to himself , and looked away from those eyes
were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them
he noticed it before
the man was not drunk He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger
of course , he remembered now
blurred , after two hours of steady drinking , but the occasion of it came back to him
, his head seemingly sunk in thought , started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection
and a horn blared furiously , but the man would have been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before
had been involuntary , something anybody might have done without thinking , on the spur of the moment
matter of fact , he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit
he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them
, the stranger was thanking Haney profusely and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend
driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe-driving record
man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face , without saying a word
, the driver stopped swearing at them , turned on his heel and went back to his truck
given it much thought at the time
recalled it very clearly , and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off
have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word
light went their way , they went on across the street
the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars , he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them
went alone and kept to himself , sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges
decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks , even though he made good money at his job
like that
wondered if it was worth it , having a screwball for company
didn't take the offer seriously , but he began to feel uneasy
finally got the coughing under control , he realized that Pete ( all he gave was his first name ) was still waiting for an answer -- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare
a weak laugh
I can't think of anyone , Pete
''
crease appeared between the man's eyebrows
think you aren't taking me seriously , Phil
it
has some kind of grudge
have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you
in returning favors
anything for somebody I like
cost you a cent , Phil
and try me ''
his forehead wearily
beginning to feel woolly
would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit
didn't expect anything to come of it , and there were a few people `` All right '' , he conceded finally , `` if you must know , I don't get along with the landlord
riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath
the neighbors complain , but I don't believe it
they tell me themselves if it bothers them ''
closed his eyes and nodded
looked up again , he seemed almost contented

your address
take a little time
to study your landlord's habits and movements first
, I always make it look like an accident
, if it looks reasonable
way there's no trouble for the customer ''
flew up
''
modestly
my line of work '' , he said Five minutes later , before Haney could make his break , the stranger stood up and nodded farewell
the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently , and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure
to stay a little longer , and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass on the table
before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack , putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep
day , Sunday , the hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before
in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy , and he groaned
for more aspirin later in the day , and passed the surly landlord on the way -- he was still alive and scowling as usual , as if tenants were a burden in his life
and ignored him
back to work Monday
the landlord was still alive
On Thursday , Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly , and wished the stranger could do something about her Coming home from work , he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building
lobby , people were standing around , talking excitedly
crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened
had died
afternoon , it seemed , he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection
apparently been alone
the fall -- just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance
that nobody noticed his sudden pallor , as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks
something about how terrible it was , and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator
his apartment , he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair
while he began to feel better about it , especially when no one bothered to ask any questions
all , why should they
, he finally convinced himself that it was an accident -- just a coincidence
really had nothing to do with it , of course Haney went to bed , happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord
, the man had no family , so no one suffered , and everybody was better off for it
he said to himself , nobody kills a man just as a favor
thought I didn't mean what I said
eyes were large and sad , as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings
like a recurrent , annoying dream , but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare
Haney knew it was not a dream
be very tight , but he knew where he was
the same bar , and it was two weeks later -- Saturday night , when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual
been sitting in the usual corner at the little table , as far as possible from any talkative , friendly lushes
enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water
grievance was not the landlord
already quite forgotten about him
, he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment
grievance was Lolly
end of his fourth hairy highball , while he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass , he became aware that he was not alone
up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table , smiling a secret smile at him , as if they were fellow conspirators
even noticed -- what was his name

hadn't seen him sit down
was uncanny , like a shadow , and made as much noise as a shadow
like shrinking out of sight , but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry , dark little man
to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing
going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy
to start going to some of the other places again
low voice , almost whispering , the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back
the mistake of answering in an offhand way , and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice
slightly , then became sad and moody
want to encourage his company , but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow , to prevent possible trouble
was no trouble
sulked over his drink , obviously upset by Haney's lack of appreciation
the uncomfortable silence , Haney began to talk
, and two drinks later , he was complaining bitterly about his wife , He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener -- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes
paused to moisten his throat , the stranger broke in
why pay her bills
runs around with other men , and if you hate her as you say , why not just divorce her ''

bitch would love a divorce '' , he growled
she'd get half of everything I have
deal -- you know
to sell out my business to pay her off with her share
drop dead ''
understandingly
yes
see
understand , I haven't been in this state too long
out here to retire
I -- why I do a free job now and then
have told me about her before ''
a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again
wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain
just suppose this guy was really what he said he was
professional killer If he was just a nut , no harm was done
he was the real thing , he could do something about Lolly
very cunning , very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot
offense intended '' , he said gently
it's just that -- well , you know
didn't suspect a thing , and I thought it was a coincidence
, I didn't know you , Pete
have been an accident ''
casually
if you say you managed it '' The stranger was hooked
burned feverishly
, yes '' , he muttered impatiently
course it looked like an accident
work it that way -- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi
prove it , Phil
I can manage one more favor for you ''
eagerly
the liquor in the bottom of his glass
back Pops groped against a wall and stopped , pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end , and went through
'' , he whispered ; ; `` floor level's about three feet down , so don't fall ''
through and down , into pitch darkness
, `` Jist stay still
the boards back and then get us a light
where you are ''
stayed where I was while he fumbled around and then walked away
later he struck a match and lighted a candle , and I could see
a big room , empty except for a few things of Pops's at the far end -- a wooden crate on which stood the candle , a spread out blanket , and an unrolled bindle
back over my shoulder while I went to join him ; ; he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no light would show through
the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as I sat down beside him on the spread blanket
first '' , I said
and handed it back
place '' , I told him
, I got a buddy I travel with , real nice guy named Larry
where he is , right near here
join the party and sleep here tonight too
be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you ''
a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` Sure-sure '' , and I reassured him
bring a bottle too , and I'll get another one or maybe two while I'm out
work on this one while I'm gone , kill it if you want ''
a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him
sure-sure '' was enthusiastic this time
the bottle down
over by the window while there's light , an' I'll put th' candle out
come back I'll put it out agin till you're both inside ''
waiting , leaning against a building front
set-up '' , I told him
we got to go back to Fifth and get another bottle or two
way I'll give you the scoop ''
way I gave him the scoop
another pint of sherry and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark , put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again
my friend Larry to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable
still a little , not much , left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it , and Charlie opened his
reminded , amusedly , by a poem of Kenneth Patchen's called The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves , which Patchen himself read on a record against jazz background
consisted of only two words , the word `` Wait '' , repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different inflections , and then the word `` Now ''
blaring final chord from the jazz group
the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves
could wait all right ; ; there was no hurry
, `` Wait wait '' to Charlie and he grinned , digging the reference
the record together once
bottle passed a few times
taking long ones , but not showing the effect yet
as drunk as when I'd first talked to him , but no drunker
a capacity ; ; if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine
through the second bottle , Charlie looked at me across Pops , who was sitting between us and asked `` Now ''
, `` Wait '' , and handed the bottle to Pops for his final drink
handed it back and I had hold of it safely , Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now '' , to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once
a lead pipe cinch
a sound like the one you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger , only louder , and Pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise
, if not dead ; ; and he'd never known what hit him -- he'd never known that anything had hit him
my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat , but Charlie said `` Wait ''
said it sharply , not as in the Patchen bit , but as an order -- so I stopped my hand and looked at him
holding the piece of lead pipe out to me
don't want to know whether he's dead , yet
that blow to be borderline
him and maybe or maybe not kill
again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not
we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice

him , I saw his point ; ; it made sense
the piece of pipe from Charlie's hand and used it , harder than he had
was louder , anyway , and I thought I heard bone crack
, `` Good boy
it , if mine didn't
never know which
, now I'll give you a hand ''
Pops up and I made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat
to Charlie
put him down again the way he was
more natural position ''
that
do you feel ''
me
'' , I told him
do you feel ''

I'm exaggerating
a kick , but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again , except for stakes
not talk about it abstractly until we're out of here
first question : the bottles
take them all with us , or leave one ''
them '' , I said
we left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints
picture we want to leave for the fuzz -- whenever the body gets found
in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum
been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him ''

have taken the weapon with him too , so we take that
-- He looked around
been careful about fingerprints
you ''

the boards over the window , of course , but they're not painted and too rough to take prints
for the rough cement of the ledge
I doubt if the cops will even try dusting
dead winos every day , maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of death ''
can't take a chance on that
to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent
other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets
that ''
that and found a dirty handkerchief , some matches and fourteen cents in change
the matches -- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain fingerprints -- and the change
the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out
had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out
wouldn't have mattered except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner
not be found for days , even weeks , otherwise
once more over every point , then triple-checked
up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger , and we weren't picked up by a cop
, nobody saw us , cop or citizen
a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour
if it matters , was one A.M.
three hours ago we'd decided , in Maxine Wells's pad on Cosmo , to commit a trial murder
gone like clockwork
smoothly , I found myself thinking , and then told myself that was ridiculous
is too safe
that can get you into a padded pad
later we were back in my unpadded pad , killing what had been left of the second pint
to leave the third one intact for tomorrow
plans for me to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit mine
were really going to do it
hands on it
ahead only one step , a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes
him everything I'd learned about Seaton's habits and habitat , and he'd tell me the score on Radic
the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at Maxine Wells's pad
get there early because he had the key
on in , the less Charlie and I were seen together in public , or visited one another's rooms , the better
dead tired and slept soundly , as far as I know dreamlessly
at Maxine's and decided we were set to stay as long as it took , into or even through the evening , to talk things out
brought food and we'd decided on no drinks
along the virgin pint from last night , but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking
first , telling him everything I knew about Seaton and his house and domestic arrangements
diagrams and floor plans ; ; he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down
me equivalent and even more detailed dope on Radic , including diagrams -- one of the apartment building Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself
there several times , back when , while he and Radic had been friends , or at least not enemies
take us as long as we'd thought it might ; ; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie said , `` Well , I guess that's it
flip a coin to see which of us goes first
you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy , or what ''
a minute , Charlie '' , I said
thing we haven't discussed , expense money
some at least , if only bus fare to the scene of the crime
you're as flat broke as I am , I think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work ''

right , I'll come clean
a little stashed for a rainy day , and I guess this is rainy enough
of hundred
draw the short straw I'll lend you some bread , like fifty bucks , before I take off to visit my sister in Frisco
after I'm back , another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while I take care of your seat cover boy ''
'' , I said
a deep breath , and the plunge
that case , let's not draw
to bat first
to wait till Seaton's back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with Doris to have her have an alibi for D-night
wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything
friend Manny can go any time ''
and clapped me on the shoulder
was hoping you'd say that , Willy
wouldn't have suggested it
in that case , I take off tomorrow morning for Frisco
in case , I brought the money with me ''
he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers , merge without let
was and is and ever had been
to cherish all his brother selves , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth -- the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself
in trance ; ; there was much to grok , loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing -- all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel Foster Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face to face alone ) why Bishop Senator Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss Dawn Ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing -- Jubal's conversations coming and going -- Jubal's words troubled him most ; ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in
`` church '' which turned up over and over again among Jubal's words gave him knotty difficulty ; ; there was no Martian concept to match it -- unless one took `` church '' and `` worship '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal , by Mahmoud , by Digby

closer to understanding it in English now , although it could never have the inevitability of the Martian concept it stood for
mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking

see in almost total darkness
that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up , and Mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it ; ; his foster parents had taught him to see
the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure ; ; he was considerate of their weakness , once he learned of it
was looking forward to snow -- seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual , as he had read -- walking barefoot , rolling in it
meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother

the third ship came back several years ago and reported '' `` That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings ''
, forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak
pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes
did you know ''
sharply
me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal
it was inevitable

it was on page 573 ''
and said , `` I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression ''
they not

they were not the only impressions

considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion
Hal waited : Macneff paced some more , frowning
he said , `` Unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist exists , and he is too old for this expedition
`` A thousand pardons '' , said Hal
I have just thought of one thing
married ''
problem at all '' , said Macneff
will be no women aboard the Gabriel
if a man is married , he will automatically be given a divorce ''
, and he said , `` A divorce ''
his hands apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of course
from our reading of the Western Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce
in this case , for the couple will be separated for , at the least , forty years
he couched the provision in obscure language

later , Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him
night on this hemisphere , but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia , Japan , China , Southeast Asia , India , Siberia
the linguist , saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein
the Philippine Islands , Japan , and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac Union that spoke American
, all of southeast Asia , southern India and Ceylon , these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar
Icelandic
turned the globe swiftly for him , and he visualized Africa , which used Swahili south of the Sahara Sea
the Mediterranean Sea , Asia Minor , northern India , and Tibet , Hebrew was the native tongue
Europe , between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic-speaking peoples of northern Europe , was a thin but long stretch of territory called March
no man's land , disputed by the Haijac Union and the Israeli Republic , a potential source of war for the last two hundred years
would give up their claim on it , yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War
for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders )
spoke all of the world's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper
in his mind the rest of Earth : Iceland , Greenland , the Caribbean Islands , and the eastern half of South America
peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian-Americans who were busy resettling North America and the western half of South America after the Apocalyptic War
was North America , where American was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson Bay Preserve
that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone , Sigmen City would blaze out into space
somewhere in that enormous light , was his apartment
would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti
weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way , though in public she would be dry-eyed
and professional associates would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband , but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically
Yarrow had been killed in a crash , he must have wanted it that way
no such thing as an `` accident ''
all the other passengers ( also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die
therefore , being in disgrace , they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony
the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared
sorry for Mary ; ; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome
he told himself , this was the best way
Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other ; ; their mutual torture would be over
free to marry again , not knowing that the Sturch had secretly given her a divorce , thinking that death had dissolved her marriage
have a year in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt
the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal's child would no longer be present

if this happy event would occur
as frozen below the navel as he
who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt The gapt

no longer have to see that fat face , hear that whining voice `` Hal Yarrow ''
whining voice
slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal turned
the squat loose-jowled man , smiling lopsidedly up at him
beloved ward , my perennial gadfly '' , said the whining voice
had no idea that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage
might have known
to be bound by love ; ; Sigmen himself must have foreseen it
you , my ward ''
love you , too , my guardian '' , said Hal , choking
wonderful to see your cherished self
thought we would never again speak to each other ''
Gabriel pointed towards her destination and , under one-gee acceleration , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity , 99.1 percent of the speed of light
all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship , went into the suspensor
would lie in suspended animation for many years
later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment , the crew would join the others
sleep while the Gabriel's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured
the desired speed , the automatic equipment would cut off the drive , and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end
later , the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration
a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied
after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration
crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation
would then unthaw the rest of the personnel
in the half-year left before reaching their destination , the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed
was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out
to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen , Siddo
from the first , he faced a difficult task
that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words
of the Siddo syntax was very restricted
as Hal found out , obviously mistaken in many cases
caused Hal anxiety
was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen
if he used all of the little means at his disposal , he would be instructing his students wrongly
even getting this across would be difficult
thing , the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's ; ; the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar
true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations
was the grammatical construction of Siddo
tense system
inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future , Siddo used an entirely different word
the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future , mai'teipa
use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses
fact that Siddo not only had the normal ( to Earthmen ) three genders of masculine , feminine , and neuter , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual
gender was inflected , though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo
of indicating gender varied according to tense
other parts of speech : nouns , pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs
not , for the Angel , just a matter of running through a logical or deductive chain , or deciding on some action from some already established premise
the Angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer
was being asked to do now , however , was to re-examine all his basic assumptions , make value-judgments on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives
not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an Angel it takes time
, perhaps , especially in an Angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago
reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause , however , did not make it seem any less long to Jack
already become used to Hesperus' snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked
nothing he could do but wait
were cast
Gabriel spoke
misjudged you '' , he said slowly
had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice
we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center ; ; individually they are nearly as mortal as you -- the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exists
have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young
recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half
now , it is clear that we were in the wrong
reclaim your property , and the penalty on Hesperus is lifted
you may speak ''
did not perceive this essential distinction either , First-Born '' , Hesperus said at once , `` I was only practicing a concept that Jack taught me , called a deal ''
, you were its agent
what is the nature of this concept ''
a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other '' , Jack said
regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given ''
, he discovered , was pounding
instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth
, this process is called bargaining
is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty
major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine
property was much less important ''
'' , Gabriel said
apparently impossible
might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us ''
and Lucifer '' , Jack said , `` show that we do ''
; ; but this one was not nearly as long
it is a matter of pleasure ; ; of curiosity ; ; of a more alive time
those could be commodities under this concept
should understand , Jack , that Hesperus and Lucifer are not long out of the nursery
Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older ''
a great deal
the more reason , then '' , Jack said , `` why we must have a treaty
gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters , in return for their help in running our fusion reactors
must know if this is in accordance with your customs , and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands , to our hurt ''
this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the dictates of their own natures , and respect yours in turn
we of course agree ''
a wave of complete elation , but in a second it had vanished without a trace
was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments , and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws
in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the Earthmen -- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature
treaty principle that Gabriel was asking him to ratify , in short , was nothing less than total trust
would serve
might be , considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war
even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of Jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codified
whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion , not trust , as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders
was some precedent for it
of disarmament agreements , for instance , had been unreassuringly dismal ; ; but the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban , and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question
that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the United Nations ; ; suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between Arizona and California over water supplies
agreements `` in principle '' , with the petty details to be thrashed out later , were commonplace in diplomatic history
with them was that they almost never worked , and in fact an agreement `` in principle '' historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled
this one were to work
no question in Jack's mind of the good faith on one side , at least
could be convinced of that It was worth trying
, it had to be tried
be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had ever signed
had taught Jack , at least partially , to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters ; ; but there was no small way to handle this one
back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips
was too late
lost his audience
moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw
to be only a riot of color , light and meaningless activity
he realized that the pentagon of Angel elders had vanished , and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up
in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions , seemingly at random

on here
''
brothers have been found
on their way here ''

see them
don't show them ''
can't see them yet , Jack
in range in a short while ''
the skies , the boards , and the skies again

there was a tiny pip on the radar ; ; and it was getting bigger rapidly
was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed
skiff hove into sight , just a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks of the Coal Sack
telescope , Jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it
was still unfurled , though there were a good many holes in it , as Langer had predicted would be the case by now
a startling , almost numenous sight ; ; but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous comet's-tail of Angels
was not heading for the nursery , however
unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the Ariadne , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year
would be no chance of signaling them -- without the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone
helpless , he watched them pass him
, ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars
never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast
was it going
was it causing so much agitation among the Angels , and being followed by so many of them
only one possible answer , but Jack's horrified mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's course into the computer
on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with , however
was headed for the very center of the nebula -- toward that place which , Jack knew now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the Angel's life and religion
clear that Langer had at last found a way to attract the Angel's attention
equally clear that as of this moment , the treaty was off
10 Langer would have to be headed off , whether he knew where he was going or not
he did ; ; after all , he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had to work from , and he was an almost frighteningly observant man
having talked to the Angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line
decided , perhaps , that the center of the cloud was a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith ''
didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the Holy of Holies , or was simply headed in that direction by accident
was intentional , it was now also unnecessary ; ; and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be disastrous
under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from the Nernst generator switch
was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses , however , he hesitated
to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff , and he had to have it fast
power in the Coal Sack was what had triggered all the trouble in the first place -- and he already had an Angel aboard
''
''
going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do
can't take you to Earth yet
got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble
obstruct this , or will you help
it's not part of the bargain , and your elders might not like it ''
else can live in your hearth while I am in it '' , Hesperus said promptly
for my elders , they have already admitted that they were wrong
of this incident they become angry with Earth , I will not be permitted to go there at all
course I will help ''
short-lived sigh of relief , Jack plugged the fuses back in and threw the switch
instant's transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board
, it had taken five minutes to -- Of course
in there
on out , the Ariadne was going to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of
he had failed to anticipate it , he lost the five minutes anyhow , in plotting an intercept orbit
, don't use this t-tau vector trick of yours , please
his bulk up and supported it on one elbow
his eyes sleepily with one huge paw
, Nogol , you guys okay ''
wrong with me that couldn't be cured '' , Nogol said
say what would cure him ; ; he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself
black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face
''

''
, let's take a ground-level look at the country around here ''
rolled open on the landscape
of bluffs hugged the horizon , the color of decaying moss
, the sky was the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above Minneapolis , seen against neon-lit snow
, empty sky was full of fire and light
almost a magnification of the Galaxy itself , of the Milky Way , blown up by some master photographer
swath was actually only a belt of minor planets , almost like the asteroid belt in the original Solar System
were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere
the infuriation of scientists , for no known reason not all of them did
be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of Yancy-6 in three generations
months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered -- much like the continent of Antarctica in ancient history
can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely ''

the captain , so he could ask questions like that
can be lonely in a crowd '' , Nogol said elaborately
will we need outside , Ryan ''

helmets '' , the captain answered
can breathe out there , all right
won't be easy
world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago
oxygen are about it ''
, look over there '' , Nogol said

ship
intelligent , maybe hostile ''
think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm interjected quietly
get no readings from them at all
electronic , galvanic -- all blank
these needles , they're stone dead ''
, you and I will have a look '' , Ryan said
hold down the fort , Nogol
easy ''
'' , Nogol confirmed
heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an encephalographic reading on him
I know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner ''
not worried about you mis-reading the dials , Nogol , just about a lug like you reading them at all
when the little hand is straight up that's negative
start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark ''
I'm ambidextrous ''
him what he could do then
, and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall
negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects
the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories
likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever
the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground
day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow
from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and came to the beast sprawled on its side
it with a boot
, this is pretty close to a wart-hog ''
'' , Ryan admitted
of the best matches I've ever found
it has to happen
and all
it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world
you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke , and somebody has been everywhere before you even started ''
looked sidewise at the captain
man seldom gave out with such thoughts
his throat
shall we do with this one
''
it with his toe , following Ekstrohm's example
don't know , Stormy
as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me
, for one thing
, that's not definite proof ''
, it isn't '' , Ekstrohm said
think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here
meantime , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent
them ''
looks like we did , when we made blastdown ''
what about our landing was lethal to the creatures ''
''

planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output
dose of radiation might knock off these critters ''
don't know about that
would work the other way
they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and don't have any R's stored up , they could take a lot without harm ''
maybe it was the shockwave we set up
it's sheer xenophobia
up and die at the sight of something strange and alien -- like a spaceship ''
'' , the captain admitted
this stage of the game anything could be possible
one possibility I particularly don't like ''
that is ''
it was not us that killed these aliens
is something right on the planet , native to it
hope it doesn't work on Earthmen too
went real sudden ''
in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet
made camp outside the spaceship
no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground , they simply had to get out
was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , ringed with a spy web to alert the Earthmen to the approach of any being
had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship
in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on Yancey-6 138
a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground
were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun
he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board
knew the others were sleeping more soundly , now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum
not asleep
could be an end to pretending
off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor
up
no longer any need to hide
was there to do
changed for him
longer had to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep
he could walk around , leave the light on , read
small comfort for insomnia
slept
had informed him he was mistaken about this
they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot
he was absolutely correct -- he never slept
processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons
fell into a waking , gritty-eyed stupor ; ; but he never slept
all
he couldn't let his shipmates know this
ground him from the Exploration Service , on physiological if not psychological grounds
to hide it
years , he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide
invariably took advantage of him
couldn't sleep anyway , he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports
hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain
with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him
to hide his secret
camp , instead of shipboard , hiding the secret was easier
secret itself was just as hard
up a lightweight no-back from the ship's library , a book by Bloch , the famous twentieth century expert on sex
a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the weighty , pontifical , ponderous style
, he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble
through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air
, his mates stirred without waking
startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble
him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order , and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting , sleeplessly
burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him
, Stormy , this isn't the place for fun and games
you do with them ''
with what ''
dead beasties
dead animals laying around the ship ''
are you talking about , Ryan
you think I did with them ''
don't know
know is that they are gone ''
''
his way outside and scanned the veldt
no ring of animal corpses

wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze
be damned '' , Ekstrohm said
are right now , buddy
like anybody mucking up primary evidence ''
do you get off , Ryan ''

pick me for your patsy
got to be some kind of local phenomenon
a shipmate of being behind this ''
, Ekstrohm , I want to give you the benefit of every doubt
aren't exactly the model of a surveyor , you know
riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that ''
'' , Ekstrohm said , `` No , I didn't know that ''
been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump we've made with you
this
the pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved in ''
could I do with your lousy dead bodies
I want with them ''
I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm web
show that
the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away ''
not a new experience to Ekstrohm

new to him at all
, there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies
them , will you
you my word I'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately foul up the expedition
word , can't you ''

and was given a name

first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant
not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery
all were removed to Central Laboratory School where their delicate transformation began
the babies died in the initial transferral but of Helva's `` class '' , seventeen thrived in the metal shells
kicking feet , Helva's neural responses started her wheels ; ; instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions
matured , more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship
was destined to be the `` brain '' half of a scout ship , partnered with a man or a woman , whichever she chose , as the mobile half
be among the elite of her kind
intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high
as her development within her shell lived up to expectations , and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering , Helva would live a rewarding , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary , `` normal '' being
no diagram of her brain patterns , no early I.Q. tests recorded certain essential facts about Helva that Central must eventually learn
have to bide their official time and see , trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession
run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships
were , of course , long past the experimental stages
survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small , eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells
, very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine
resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were , but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the Universe
for happy years , Helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates , playing such games as Stall , Power-Seek , studying her lessons in trajectory , propulsion techniques , computation , logistics , mental hygiene , basic alien psychology , philology , space history , law , traffic , codes : all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen
obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , Helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid
one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction
was not without busy , do-good associations , exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens
group got all incensed over shelled `` children '' when Helva was just turning fourteen
were forced to , Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs
committees ever looked past the first few photos
their original objections about `` shells '' were overridden by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully concealed
was doing Fine Arts , a selective subject in her crowded program
activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel
was large -- a copy of the Last Supper -- and her canvas , small -- the head of a tiny screw
tuned her sight to the proper degree
worked she absentmindedly crooned , producing a curious sound
used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths
then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings
, what a lovely voice you have '' , said one of the female visitors
looked '' up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular , dirty craters on a flaky pink surface
became a gurgle of surprise
regulated her `` sight '' until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions
, we have quite a few years of voice training , madam '' , remarked Helva calmly
peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated
my lessons ''
was the first time that Helva had seen unshelled people , she took this experience calmly
reaction would have been reported instantly
meant that you have a nice singing voice dear '' , the lady amended
you
like to see my work ''
, politely
sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation
''
lady
am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the head of a screw ''
, I say '' , the lady twittered
her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically
course , some of my color values do not match the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair copy ''
eyes , unmagnified , bugged out
, I forget '' , and Helva's voice was really contrite
could have blushed , she would have
people don't have adjustable vision ''
of this discourse grinned with pride and amusement as Helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate
, this will help '' , suggested Helva , substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture
kind of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed Last Supper on the head of a screw
'' , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife , `` the good Lord can eat where angels fear to tread ''
you referring , sir '' , asked Helva politely , `` to the Dark Age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin ''
had that in mind ''
you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in question ''
you are programed to compute ''
course ''
they remember to program a sense of humor , as well , young lady ''
are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect ''
man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time
investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School , they left Helva with a morsel as well
'' as applicable to herself required research
, of course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as `` Tristan und Isolde '' , `` Candide '' , `` Oklahoma '' , `` Nozze de Figaro '' , the atomic age singers , Eileen Farrell , Elvis Presley and Geraldine Todd , as well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians , Capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the Altairians
singing '' for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome
were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis
between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations
Helva , the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her
work out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing
the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental
sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal
and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice
did not , strictly speaking , breathe
purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells
, Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone
the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses , she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone
the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them , not at all unharmonious , merely unique
repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall
herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy
not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass , baritone , tenor , alto , mezzo , soprano and coloratura as she pleased
, to Helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted
authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves
were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work
anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the Aj
titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship
, audio , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed
were diverted , connected or augmented and the final , delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while Helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings
awoke , she was the ship
and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed
take care of herself and her ambulatory half , in any situation already recorded in the annals of Central Worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine
actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession
ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner
nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned
several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva had been of interest to several department heads in Central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section
one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective partners
always chose its own partner
been another `` brain '' ship at the Base at the moment , Helva would have been guided to make the first move
was , while Central wrangled among itself , Robert Tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks , out to the field and over to Helva's slim metal hull
, anyone at home ''

course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners
you my partner ''
hopefully , as she recognized the Scout Service uniform
you have to do is ask '' , he retorted hopefully
one has come
perhaps there were no partners available and I've had no directives from Central ''
herself Helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field
had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score
solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive
directives from Central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing ''
have killed you in the cabin
have anything for me ''
, not knowing what B'dikkat meant , and the two-nosed man answered for him , `` I think he has a nice baby head , but it isn't big enough for you to take yet ''
noticed the needle touch his arm
turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit Mercer
to run after B'dikkat , to hug the lead spacesuit , to tell B'dikkat that he loved him
and fell , but it did not hurt
girl lay near him
to her
it wonderful
, beautiful , beautiful
happy to be here ''
covered with growing hands came and sat beside them
warmth and good fellowship
that she looked very distinguished and charming
out of his clothes
foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did
women babbled and crooned at him
corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it
of his mind he was happy
how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this
to tell the Lady Da , but the words weren't quite straight
stab hit him in the abdomen
went after the pain and swallowed it
like the cap in the hospital , only a thousand times better
was gone , though it had been crippling the first time
himself to be deliberate
his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert , `` That was a good bite
will grow another head
make B'dikkat happy ''
Da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position
, `` I'm strong , too
talk
man , remember
live forever
die , too , we can die like real people
so believe in death ''
at her through his happiness
course you can
this nice '' With this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack
wide awake , but he did not feel like doing anything
beautiful place , among all those companionable and attractive people , he sat and smiled
sterilizing his knives
how long the super-condamine had lasted him
the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement
of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing
his own body with remote , casual interest
Da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him
long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms
he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them , and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged
the sun rise on occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining
no meaning
fed him in their mysterious way ; ; the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body
he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain
themselves had not changed ; ; he had
all the events which could take place on Shayol
them well from his happy period
had noticed them -- now he felt them
to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug , and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again
at him with benign , remote happiness ; ; apparently her many torsos , stretched out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body
him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech
lay on the ground , arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity
the man's shoulder
woke , recognized Mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin
A good morrow to you , my boy
of a play
ever see a play ''
mean a game with cards ''
'' , said the half-man , `` a sort of eye-machine with real people doing the figures ''
never saw that '' , said Mercer , `` but I '' -- `` But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going to come back with the needle ''
'' , said Mercer , a little ashamed of his obviousness
'' , said the half-man
I think of plays
know what is going to happen
know when it is going to happen
know what the dummies will do '' -- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled -- `` and we all know what the new people will ask
never know how long a scene is going to take ''
a ' scene ' ''

that the name for the needle ''
laughed with something close to real humor
, no , no
the lovelies on the brain
is just a part of a play
we know the order in which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes
seems short and the pleasure seems long
to think that they are about two Earth-weeks each ''
not know what an `` Earth-week '' was , since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time
received a dromozootic implant , turned red in the face , shouted senselessly at Mercer , `` Take it out , you fool
out of me ''
looked on helplessly , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to Mercer , and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself
could not tell how long it was before B'dikkat came back
have been several days
have been several months
B'dikkat moved among them like a father ; ; once again they clustered like children
B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer's thigh -- a sleeping child's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes
the blissful needle
cut the head from Mercer's thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body
the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately
time it was two legs growing from his chest
had been another head beside his own
that after the torso and legs , waist to toe-tips , of the little girl which had grown from his side
the order
not count time
smiled at him often , but there was no love in this place
lost the extra torsos
teratologies , she was a pretty and shapely woman ; ; but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` People never live forever ''
this immensely comforting , even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it
occurred , and victims changed in appearance , and new ones arrived
took the new ones , resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains , in a ground-truck to be added to other herds
in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them
Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin
to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it
memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask B'dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no longer be available when he needed it
itself , he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there
agreed , but he did not come out of the doorway
through the public address box built into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain , so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting to tell them
said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount of time that Mercer had been on Shayol : `` Standard years -- eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes
, fellow ''
away
little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B'dikkat
the cow-man to remain on Shayol
him happy without super-condamine
a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day , surrounded by a family of little cow-people resembling himself
despite his happiness , wept a little at the strange fate of B'dikkat
fate he accepted
the last time he had eaten -- actual eggs from an actual pan
kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it
back to the group
Da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her
unclaimed square miles of seating space around them , but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less
The years , if they were years , went by
of Shayol did not change
bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; ; those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain Alvarez
night and day , but no setting of crops , no change of season , no generations of men
still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the Lady Da took on very remote meaning
never live forever ''
was a hope , not a truth in which they could believe
not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all
no dream of escape for these people
saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond B'dikkat's cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh
ago , some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter
was on a rock
it , and so had a few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it
they care
, scraped on stone , had been a message home
still read the opening : `` Once , I was like you , stepping out of my window at the end of day , and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place I lived in
like you , I had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands
part of my head was called a face , and I could talk with it
can only write , and that only when I get out of pain
told himself he would forget Ann Turner
well rid of her
didn't want a wife who was fickle as Ann
had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble
of this was rationalization
woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann , and then could not get back to sleep
and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing
thing would be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it
antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work
that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake
he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; ; each day the hurt was a little duller , a little less poignant
plenty of work to do
summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years
in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here
not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows
no idea how much time Budd would give him
case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence
every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with monotonous calm
in late afternoon on the last day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle
be some kind of trick Budd had thought up
walked in this country , least of all Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar B crew
the two figures for a time , puzzled
were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever
his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started downstream
had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house
saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet
house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands
through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty
dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door
there , making no effort to get back on her feet
came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring
, thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one
think it was possible for this couple to be pretending
licked his dry lips
, `` Could we have a drink ''
his head toward the front door
the kitchen '' , he said
Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl
up
in the house ''
move or say anything
were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him
reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked
was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry
hair was frowzy , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection
have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding
her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house
amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious
suspicion that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled
would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him
she had a sweet face that attracted him
her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table
a good deal alike , Morgan thought
blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features
the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth
greedily , and murmured , `` Thank you '' , as he lowered her head
looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition
seen a few nester wagons go through the country , the families almost starving to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two
dropped off to sleep
to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove
his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy
are you and what happened to you ''

Billy Jones '' , the boy answered
my wife Sharon
out of money and we haven't eaten for two days ''
are you doing here ''
we in Wyoming ''

five miles north of the line ''
as if relieved
been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down ''
mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work ''

town of Buckhorn's only about six miles from here
you go there ''
didn't want town work '' , Jones said
is a mighty empty country '' , Morgan said
only one more ranch three miles north of here
starved to death if you'd missed both places ''
we're lucky we got here
give us a job , Mr. '' `` Morgan
''
silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple
kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house
the possibility at once
thin face haunted him
the face of a killer
so sure about the boy
shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression
more to this than Jones had told him
running from something
an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either
could use some help '' , Morgan said finally , `` but I can't afford to pay you anything
you'd better go on in the morning ''
work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly
been mucking in a mine in the San Juan , but I used to work on a ranch
she's cooked in a restaurant
hard , Mr. Morgan ''
see '' , Morgan said
now you need a meal and a bath
in terrible shape ''
know '' , Jones said dejectedly
the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table
meal was ready , he told Jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl
, `` I've got some supper ready ''
her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair
a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed
are you
we get here ''
Dan Morgan
the Rafter Aj
down in front of the house , and I carried you in
you a drink and then you went to sleep ''
''
at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; ; then she murmured : `` You're very kind , Mr. Morgan
take in all the strays who come by ''
don't have many strays coming to my front door '' , he said
you can walk to the table ''
course ''
to her feet , staggered , and almost fell
her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen
down at the table , shaking her head
sorry , Mr. Morgan
a very strong woman , but I'm awfully tired ''
hungry '' , he said
in
much of a meal , but it's what I eat ''
much of a meal ''
cried
Morgan , it's the best-looking food I ever saw ''
himself he had never seen two people eat so much
were finally satisfied , Jones said , `` I think he's going to give us work ''
way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself
saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on
, `` I guess the Lord looks out for fools , drunkards , and innocents ''

are you ''
not drunkards '' , she said
all I'm sure of ''
him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark
the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall
: `` You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath
are in bad shape , Mrs. Jones
to go to town to see the doc ''
, she'll be all right '' , Jones said quickly
mean , we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town ''
see '' , Morgan said
you find me a needle and thread ''
asked
dress needs some work on it ''
and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors
: `` I'm going to bed ''
at the door in front of him
my spare bedroom
isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there ''
awfully kind '' , the girl said
pay you back if you'll let us
''
all right '' , he said
get up early
sleep ''
him into the front room , closing the door behind him
: `` If it's all right with you , Mr. Morgan , I'll sleep out here on the couch
slept together since we started
can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together '' He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place ''
got fired '' , Jones said
had to do something ''
a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed
wearily
can't stay here with me
and you said they'd be here by dawn ''
can't make me go ''
down again into his chair and began to rock
thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide
the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt
black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see
to call back the face of the man he had known
other man he could rally his anger ; ; against this bent man in the chair he was powerless
moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words
you remember Big Charlie ''

stuck with me all these years
half-breed 'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me
into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son
a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so
him
Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago
, they all left me
out
understand why , Clay
all cleared out
them fair '' He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder
you mean '' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're goin ''
''
don't hate me any more ''
, shook his head , murmuring , `` No ''
here ''
man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him
his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely
my life '' , he said , `` I tried

you driftin away -- but I tried
wanted no part of me when I had so much to give
nothin left of me
gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me

Heaven , I can't refuse you now
mock me too much
you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears
go , Clay ''
himself from the embrace and stepped back
followed him fearfully
horses
much time
the horses and bring them round
ready '' He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air
was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words
had finished he led him and the mare to the porch
had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head
the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck
had backed away
take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered
doesn't want you now
it easy , your time will come ''
on the porch , a thin figure
taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor
to him and he came slowly down the steps
'' , he said , `` where are we goin ''
a ranch in the valley
there I have to see
take her with us -- to California
know yet , it's crazy ; ; I have to think about it
is where we're goin ''
''
to nod
a new land
could make a mark there
, together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been
fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened ''
, like a father and son ''
made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered
made you so you could stand up
you a man ''
, Gavin , you did ''
the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck
me up , Clay
up , I feel kind of stiff ''
him gently into the saddle , like a child
hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said
trample it down
my garden ''
will grow again -- in California ''
loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily
alone here for three years , before any man came
by the river
nice then , so peaceful and quiet
no one but me
want to leave it ''
into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump
horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness
rode at a measured pace through the valley
come soon and the night was at its coldest
had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before
as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind -- a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men
bitterly
inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind
them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying
his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life
oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search
ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills
last the darkness began to dissolve
line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky
light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies
been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees
men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence
in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy
liquor had flushed their courage
the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose
their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire
his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked
leavin
you wanted , isn't it
with him , takin him out of the valley
'' -- `` Keep out of this '' , Purvis snarled
not your brother , he's Gavin's son
, he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone ''
was thinking back many years
thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley
Gavin's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence
thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap
had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy
even dance with her at Gavin's party
her like she was dirt
stand by like a fool and let him do it '' He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water
the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game
Gavin's son '' , Joe Purvis had said
to Lester
brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy
to help Gavin all the time
a fool of you , Lester ''
round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy
plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place
let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back
one way they can get out now and that's through the Gap -- if we ride hard we can take them ''
fluttered to Cabot's shoulder
jerked away
killed Tom -- do you understand that ''
back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night
through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light
Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave
up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance
the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear
parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow
turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line
of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind
began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion
over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers
gained nor fell back
low on the mare's neck
him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap , no more than a mile away
was bloodless with excitement
not look back ; ; he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north
who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him
were riding to kill him
was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time
over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley
leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again
looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him
too far , he thought
never reach California
too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life
was not dead
, in fact , showing signs of reviving
been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol
hung in a belt scabbard
partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat
these from him and donned them
Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose
him inside the building

seeing the bandage , rushed to him

never felt better in my life '' , Fiske blustered
to Susan and kissed her on the cheek

talk later
we've got to get out of here ''
grab horses '' , Dean said
main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall ''
it , trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride
at least offered him a chance for living
none here
for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried
bivouac remained silent
in the orderly room across the parade ground
was on duty there
there would be men guarding the horses
dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make out in the moonlight
was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency
the guard's rifle to Fiske
and myself will try to cut out horses to ride '' , he said
stampede the rest
with the ladies
you be ready to ride hell for leather ''
, `` If this doesn't work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them ''
the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol
Dean and kissed him
to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes
away
thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had
unutterably weary
from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms
her also , and with deep tenderness
began to weep
her and joined Mike
right '' , he said
said , `` Later ''
careful , McLish ''
fiercely
way you were careful ''

around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock ''
going
no more sentimental scenes with her
say or do something foolish
of them would regret
tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her
him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride
the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol
well back of me '' , he said
going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I'm one of the guerrillas
to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close ''
pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade
pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings
stood open
through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses
tethered , army style , on stable lines
spoke near-at-hand
that ''
'' , Mike said
that you , Bill ''
his man
stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight
walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch
with the muzzle of the pistol
luck that had been running their way left him
instinctively parried the blow with his rifle
to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body
off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded
went wide
the pistol in a savage backlash
it connected solidly on the man's temple , felling him
of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills
horses began rearing on their tethers
rushing up
you hit ''

, but the fat's in the fire ''

no chance now of all of us getting away
to try it alone ''
saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need
the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line
you go ''

''
Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse
not you ''

''
frantically
lighter than me
only chance now
find these Feds
of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back
one that's taking the big chance ''
hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand
telling how good this horse is '' , Mike panted
him and save something in case you hit trouble
for Apaches when it comes daylight
pistol
need it
have the rifle , and I might be able to round up some more
the rest of these horses so they can't chase you ''
from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back
'' , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , `` I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again ''
was on his way at a gallop
down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet
a screeching war whoop
off a total stampede
inside the stockade and freed the horses there
through the gate and joined the flight
thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges
were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure
''

stealin' the stock ''
in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings
there
had been taken up and repeated
were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses
carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all
Calhoun came running from the post
pistols in their hands
questions that were not answered in the uproar
the others toward the east gate
stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches
a dash to the rear of the frame buildings
beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner
was deserted
was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade
to the door and peered in
room seemed to be deserted
hung from a peg , giving light
, he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner
of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches
case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges
a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty
load he peered from the door
of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas
at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration
his bundle down
lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post
up the powder canister and ran out
cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it
the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon
and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house
gushed beneath the wagon
was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him
the truth
to snap past him
the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack
spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again
tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety
him heavily in the thigh and he went down
racing toward him
Julia came from the door and dragged him with them
of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap
to her feet and slammed the door
aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks
entirely through the whipsawed post oak
hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars
to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet
over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls
from a loophole
only a dozen yards away , charging the house
a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired
a man with the first bullet
same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit
the rush
scattered for cover
were burning fiercely
had caught fire also
was spreading to the frame buildings
realized they faced a new problem
''

goes our grub an' ammunition ''
a bucket line going ''



began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring
few containers they found were inadequate
them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort
were in flames
drove the guerrillas back
of the command post began to buckle
the wagons to the spring ''
yelled
'em right into the spring

the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame
supply of powder had been touched off
and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings
of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike's wound
had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor
had missed the bone and had passed on through
Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury
the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it
it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village ''

, I don't want to go into any more explanations
Jason
to yourself ''
, looking worried , hurried toward us
wrong , cap'n
seem to think so ''
found a large war party south of us
attack at dawn '' , Montero said
past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp
hands as a trumpet he shouted , `` Fort up

large war party on their way ''
second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb
Billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal
flew into action
was a terrible thing to do '' , I said to Oso
treated us like friends
all the time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them
what a world you people live in ''
me an unruffled look
Knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river '' , he said calmly
would you have done in Montero's moccasins
Knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else ''
his head
Manuel did that in the war
the British never got the tribes to fight for the King
whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses
went on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin' to move up
that with all the Nations
they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else
Department wrote Mr. Manuel a letter and said he was a hero
that letter
it in a little wallet made of fish skin ''
that was war '' , I said
no war on now ''
wrong , Matt
country there's a war on every time the grass turns green
was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites
goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land ''
being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight
why this company's important
get over the mountains others will come along
the Trust don't want us to make it
Chambers
Knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work
get through he'll have the Blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods
talkin' ain't goin' to help -- let's fort up ''
dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso's logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old Knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company
unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet
an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains
I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods
he had told the others what he had done
brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river
think Montero did right '' , Amy said firmly
the savages kill each other
we care ''
was understandably bitter
was a terrible thing to do
children
Oso replied calmly , `` Trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country , rev'rend ''

Eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky
was in the center of a wide valley
set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush
ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire
herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ; the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible
horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors
had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day
filled , the herd fed and watered
part had been the waiting ; ; although we didn't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless
hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl
unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ; I didn't catch a wink
I closed my eyes , I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife
a relief when they finally came
through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry
'' , Montero called `` I'll get Gray Eyes ''
be a pleasure to see '' , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle
your fire '' , Montero was shouting
until my shot
the first man who doesn't ''
see them in my sights
about a mile off ; ; under me the ground quivered slightly
they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads
emerged as men
was in the lead
was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ; jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest
naked except for a clout
him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions
was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams
his chest in my sights
a red circle
came nearer and nearer
, how long is he going to wait , I thought
cracked
I thought he had missed
remained erect
lance was still above his head
started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse
the trigger
last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony
the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball
to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing
once in the grass and lay still
you're goin' to kill 'em --
''

he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides
broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated
up

back ''
shouting
the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing
front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses
air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder
screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy
cracked ; ; the square head fell over
the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek
pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him
a ragged volley
dead before he hit the ground
Christ's sake , don't waste your powder on one of 'em ''
furiously
for the charge
, I tell you ''
cries at the end of the valley were faint
louder as the Indians charged again
see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their spine-chilling cries
Eyes is back , , Montero said
captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat
see the blood running down his chest
riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump
to aim
sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger
had caught him high in the chest ; ; there was no doubt he was dying
waited for Montero
he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire
were only several lengths away when he fired
flung Gray Eyes from his horse
volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts
few reached our wall
the whir of an ax and a Canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray
Little Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian's face became shattered flesh and bone
leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight

up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck
were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets
got one , the Canadians the others
the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position
were almost uncontrollable
of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again
more of them hurdled the barrier
Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt
like a man kicking a melon
a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales
shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me
smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil
were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in
the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil
me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint
made one last desperate charge
pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses
badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs
soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts
them reached our walls again
survivors grudgingly turned away
distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song
carrying a quirt , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist
saw your fire '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort to control her anger
could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size
matter to a fool like you
to me ''
right '' , Wilson said quickly
fire's too big
appreciate the advice ''
losing patience again
before , with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness , he would have appreciated company
helped him change his mind
not advising you '' , she said
telling you
too big
burn down
sure it's out when you leave in the morning ''
taken aback
him a long time to compose himself
some mistake '' , he said finally
right about the fire
than it has to be , though I don't see where it's doing any harm
wrong about the rest of it
leaving in the morning
I
the place ''
her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face
seem to tell her anything
around the clearing , taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground , the two kids , the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight
it for a long time
turned back to Wilson and smiled , and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it
own this place ''
, and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly
bought it ''
a man in St. Louis '' , Wilson said
Carwood
know him ''
laughed
know him
to
ran him off here six years ago ''
say anything
watching the girl , wondering what was coming next
picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him
didn't tell you that '' , she said
'' , Wilson said
it's understandable
the kind of thing that a man would be proud of
doesn't make any difference
me a clear title
it with me , right here
want to see '' -- `` Never mind '' , she said sternly
wouldn't matter to my father , and not to me
what I said about that fire
it's out when you leave

you go back to doing the dishes now ''
meant to insult him , and didn't quite succeed
the reins just below the bit and held them firmly , and it was his turn to smile now
don't mind washing dishes now and then '' , he said pleasantly
doesn't hurt
hurt you , though
mistake you for a woman ''
to say more , but he never got the chance
quick
the quirt down , slashing it across his cheek , and he tried to step back
the quirt again , and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle
down against him , and he tried to break her fall
her by the shoulders and went down on one knee , taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him
him a little sick , and he let go of her
up slowly , and she was already on her feet , and he stood facing her
the blood from his cheek
ought to '' -- he said
shaking with anger , his breath coming in long , painful gasps
quirt -- I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good
were a man '' -- `` She isn't , mister ''
came from behind him , and Wilson turned
had gone down , and the man was only a shadow against the trees
moment later he brought his horse forward into the light , and Wilson had a good look at him
tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed , Wilson thought
was handsome , despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek
not a man , mister '' , he said
am
got any ideas ''
the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson's chest
the rifle down , Joseph '' , the girl said
irritated
thought I told you to stay home ''
eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap
looked pure white in the half-darkness ; ; his eyes were black and deep-set , and expressionless
shouldn't be riding up here after dark , Judith '' , he said quietly
can take care of this
job for you ''
tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him
it without flinching
said go home , Joseph
no business up here ''
didn't answer this time
scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth , and his eyes were hurt and angry
Wilson wonder
the half-breed as he turned silently
hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while , then the sound faded out
the dust from his coat
was that ''

personal guard
hard on him ''
works for my father '' , the girl said , and then seemed to change her mind
a friend
Joseph Sanchez
anything else you want to know ''
now '' , Wilson said
guess I'll find out soon enough
blood on your cheek


have got there when you fell against me ''
it off with the sleeve of her coat
bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said
her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist
, no '' , he said , and he was without humor now
had enough of that
enough of you
know what goes on around here , and I don't care
know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business , and I don't care about that , either
me by surprise
know how to handle you next time ''
up her free hand to hit him , but this time he was quicker
her blow and she fell , stumbling against the gelding
regained her balance and got up in the saddle
had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before
forgotten that she was so pretty
prettiness was what he had noticed first , and all the other things had come afterward : cruelty , meanness , self-will
known women like that , one woman in particular
had been too many
the girl until she had gone into the trees , and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer , then went up to where the children were sleeping
sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending
shown up too well in their eyes , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman
greater things from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances , and they were disappointed
not to show it
a little too stiffly , with their eyes straining to stay closed
to sleep '' , he said
of you
things to do than listen to something like that
down at the creek finishing the dishes , if you want me ''
the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream
was calling again , and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it
, at any rate
a feeling that the girl meant trouble
did , he could stand it better in the light
absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out
when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house , his hopes had been high
of the pain had gone from Amelia's death
of it
still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief
were starting a new life
had almost everything they needed : land , a house , two whiteface bulls , three horses
wasn't all Wilson had expected of it
and forty acres , the old man back in St. Louis had said ; ; good grass , good water
the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it
was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard
was a house ; ; livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs
last analysis , though , Wilson had little cause to complain
had been cheap -- just the little he had left after Amelia's burial -- and it would serve its purpose
only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry : the peace and quiet
started out that way
had a feeling -- thanks to the girl -- that things would get worse before they got better
had the house cleaned up by noon , and Wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses
on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness , and finally went over to help him
already in the wagon
going to town , and they were both excited
the team into the traces , and wished they weren't going to town at all
an uneasy feeling about it
last night , what was her name

the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember
with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him
spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning , and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem
brush , and stands of pine that no grass could grow under , and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze
was water
an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees , fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard
there was plenty of water , too much , and that was probably the trouble
tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres
part of the road was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley
hotter once they reached the flat , and drier , but the grass was better
breeze played across it , moving it like waves
hawk flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road
them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville
was about what Wilson expected : one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings , a water tower , a few warehouses , a single hotel ; ; all dusty and sunbaked
was quiet
my state of mind that I did not question the possibility of this ; ; under the circumstances I was only too willing to confess all
nearly thirty at the time
to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters
dark and , I sensed , very large ; ; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it
was aware of people moving about in the darkness
turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded
of three of four vague figures , at the most
and there
as if waiting
glow of a cigarette
could see me but I not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me
paid them no attention
me , until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence
simply consisted in registering new men
phone rang he answered it
extended to the far edge of the counter , no further
the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him
attacking his pate
to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality
his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath
obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was
was not easy for him and he often slipped
of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced
certain he was really a spineless little man
( the cause of his baldness
on a hook on the wall , and underneath it I could see his tie , knotted , ready to be slipped over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck
tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines
shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music
the clerk was trivial
pressing him , I learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall
disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person
I saw him assume a pompous air
saw me coming he turned his radio off
a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf
pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance
knowledge he possessed he forced upon me
mornings , I was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall
and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office
out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words
shown , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning
here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand
afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said
those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient
my hand
would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket
else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself
lighted , what would it look like
of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air
, upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , I had visited the toilet adjoining the hall
the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time
I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended
observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison
for some time been hoping , in vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself
that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , I could not tell
, I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light
did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below
clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder
would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention
had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently
of petty vigilance annoyed me
certain it was self-appointed
from a type of mentality I'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here
to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed
strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance
in a state of suspense because of it
not cling to my past nor did I wish to
signed it off on the forms
lay solely with the hall , yet what did I know about the hall at this point
had been inside it I had not yet seen it functioning
to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes I ought to be wearing
not despair , however ; ; far from it
constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall
a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me
flanked the street on which the hall fronted
was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it
noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs
issuing from beyond -- winches whirring , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me
, on the other hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons
nothing I'd ever seen before
was windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked out upon the street
circling the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall
was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it
I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there
to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk
had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application
had passed well into summer
, when I put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual
asked him what , if anything , I could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall
consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o'clock
impressed this upon me : that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock
went for my interview with the director I saw why
was dark as usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people
littered the floor
fans were going , drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling
felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs
itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men
by the counter
was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office I noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open
I could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor
office
my knuckles on the counter
came to the door
at once disappointed , although just what I had expected him to look like I could not have explained
a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; ; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar
perforated , white-topped shoes ; ; they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment
came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application
the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times
not look at them now
lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall
, in a voice as immaculate as his appearance
I registered
pardon , he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall
looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them
sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for
of men I would come into contact with , at the hall
did not surprise me ; ; I felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place
doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying
always , I said , hankered after working hard with my hands
, I went on , growing voluble as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing
effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence
, hard cap was small , but he thrust it to the back of his head
him up ''
with it ''
could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head , hard
went over without sound , falling to the bare floor
harshly , `` Why did you do that ''
at him
did you want me to do , kiss him
me in solitary twice ''
the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around
get one thing straight , you and me
reason we brought you was to get Miller out
ever try anything without my orders I'll kill you ''
looked at him
to Barton that the green eyes mocked him , the thin-lipped smile held insolence , but he had no time to waste now
on
''
out through the guard-room door , into the paved square
three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate , but they were in other cell blocks
no chance
slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall
no moon
chosen this night purposely
the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above , and Powers slipped through the door
were on duty inside , playing pinochle , relaxed
up in surprise as Powers came in
are you doing out of the block ''
Curtiss '' , he said , naming the man Rankin had hit
got to have help ''
at him
in charge climbed to his feet
wrong with him ''
having some kind of a fit ''
turned to the door
passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side
sound and you're dead ''
froze
not followed
covering the remaining guard
half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell
his arm aside
with none of Rankin's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head
free
could not quite believe it
gone without a hitch
through the wicket in the big gate , ghosted across the dark ground
later they reached the horses
relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts
been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short
hurried
the horses , heading along the river , Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead , seven men riding quietly through the night
thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards , three the striped suits of convicts

small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees
brought extra clothing also
man , Emmett
been one of the original Night Riders , one who had escaped the trial
to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison
was crying softly to himself , shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt
was unusually silent , Rankin watchful , a few paces apart
his dressing and extended his hand to Powers
won't even try to thank you ''
guard was embarrassed
in a studied voice , `` I didn't do it for you
it for the valley
only man the Night Riders will follow
starving and I don't like to starve ''
away , his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse
luck ''
lifted his head
you want me to ride out ''
aren't one of us
for you here ''
got no place to go ''

not trust Rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct
years in prison had taught him realities
in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money
all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night Riders , to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure
they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the killers on the other side
choice '' , he said briefly , and turned to Kid Boyd
those uniforms so they won't be found ''
touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off , up the river bank
a careful , uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley
on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket , passing it over silently
knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco
drew in the fragrance deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled
gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly
first five years in prison , they had shared a cell
was neither a rancher nor a valley man
been the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money
done time for the theft
thing they had in common was their hatred
Donald Kruger
drawn them together , and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape
now , `` I've got the perfect headquarters set up
Haskell mine ''
knew the place
before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley
spent a million dollars , carving in a road , putting up buildings , drilling their haulage tunnel
vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned
road's washed badly '' , said Dill , `` but there's a trail you can get over with a horse
of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail ''

do the valley people feel ''
mad as ever
men keep them off balance , and they don't trust me
outsider
learn you're in the hills though , they'll rally , don't worry about that ''
for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind
boy
find him ''
silent as if he hated to answer , and Barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension
in Morgan's Ferry ''
in surprise
he doing there ''
hesitated
faro ''
faro
''
sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon ''
under his breath
long pause he asked , `` How many people know who they are ''

Finley saw to that
a rat , you know
out to Kruger's men
them of everything you've ever written him
your ranch ''
up
tensely , `` All right
get the boy ''
come up also
was afraid of this
didn't tell you ''
you hadn't I'd have killed you ''
tightened
you can't ride into the Ferry
they'll expect you to do
there waiting for you
how you feel about the child
The hell you do ''
was rougher than Dill had ever heard it
never saw him
died in childbirth after I was sent away
can't leave him there
would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and I wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care
to get the boy
''
Barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult
over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state
Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame
the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield
men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences
involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg , and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence
sat in his office above the Ione pit
was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove
was dwarfed by the scene outside
dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside
was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth
partially cemented by ages and pressure , yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a thousand fire hoses , and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices
dollars' of gold a month
tons of rock and soil and brush
ran twenty-four hours each day
, like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles
like all who worked near the pits , was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums
a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air
in loose rolls beneath the shirt
older than Mitch Barton , he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation
proud of his accomplishments , proud of his job , proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him
and breathed for the mining company
could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life
a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room
never accustomed himself to Kodyke
was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose
always held Hague , eyes of a dead man , lidless as a lizard's , with the fixed intensity of a cobra
was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke
nothing about the man's history
appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger
to head the dread company police
the change rooms
out the hi-graders
the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco
down his uneasy dislike
open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype
is Mitchell Barton
out of Folsom last night
bribed one of the guards
him back there or we want him dead ''
the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully
''
, yes
how the ranchers in the valley are
us for all their troubles
ago they blew up some of our ditches
us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them
want Barton's Night Riders loose again ''
nodded , slipping the picture into his breast pocket , saying nothing
wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said
sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it
had finished eating , Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm -- `` so that Auntie Grace can teach it about the whistle '' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother
offered to walk , but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called `` Auntie ''
reached their neighbor's house , Pamela said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompted by a stray thought -- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days -- that they might never see one another again
turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her ostensible destination
drove , she thought about her plan
really quite simple
, in fact , that it might even work -- although Pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance
, she thought , had cost her dearly these past few days , and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her
be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest
station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house , Pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house , and stopped
her movements were careful and methodical , partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime
the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house
she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom
bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving -- an object which , Pamela believed now , had been the property of her great-grandfather , Major Hiram Munroe Culver
belonged to this land and , perhaps , had desecrated it -- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him
, Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation
return this symbol to the mountain , as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice
thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down the stairs and out of the house
only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that unnamed , unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom
if atonement were possible , could only be made at that sacred , sacrificial basin
there that she would have to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness
was insane , Pamela thought
was all a vividly conceived dream
was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken
forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool
little of her previous journey there with Grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it
was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand
was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle
and chattered in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time
not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after all
Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning
had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed
not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this
calm and peaceful as she walked along
flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear
them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants
too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them
days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; ; today , on the contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable
not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; ; she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal
as she walked , her steps fumbled from time to time , she chose to ignore that omen
slope grew steeper and the groves more dim , she tried not to heed
upon maintaining her equanimity ; ; she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest
took on an impersonal aspect
not care what sort of person prowled its woods , plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes
indifferent , unmotivated , the forest was simply there -- fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter
or white man , pacifist or killer , the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence ; ; knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man
her head
not think about time
another one of those traps
grim pursuit of tranquillity , Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband
when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand
he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent
would not impinge upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined , ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor
, daylight mind would whistle away such images ; ; they would not dare to face his scoffing
glad Jim was nowhere near
would have interfered with her duty
grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles
huddled more closely together , their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun
vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass , Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction
she continued to move upward
sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles
had become an alien world where she strove , alone , unprotected , unguided , to deal with whatever hindrances were offered
a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , eclipsing the sun and human time
and the same time , she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry
into the forest -- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees
at Pamela's side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear
in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , blocking her retreat
over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth
of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , bruising her arm on a naked stone
moment , she could not catch her breath and then , her breath returning in short , frightened spasms , she lifted herself to her feet laboriously
to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes
bled slightly , and the offended skin cried out in pain
around
bewildered
to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees
quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her
standing in a thick grove
were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped , virtually shutting out the sun completely
smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays
the feeling that , under the mouldering leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain
made Pamela shudder
chill swept through the grove
breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove , catching Pamela in a leering embrace
a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified , never actually perceived
had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene
knew this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive
her clammy hands and twined around her ankles
into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body , seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin
across her breasts , suffocating the life in her nipples
her thighs , exploring with its icy tentacles
her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus , and its particles , spreading , creeping , crawling , joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached ; ; stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps ; ; clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws
to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , depriving her of reason and sight
did not know which way to go
of the trees engulfed her , foreclosing every possible exit from the grove
been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles
not scream , for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth , who would hear , who would listen
mountain listen
blindly
to escape
to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place
forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back
body protested , aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed , where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed
she made seemed unnecessarily noisy
loudly under her feet ; ; bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; ; tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her
she found exactly the right statement
it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him
want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord
aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg , and that I don't amount to anything
-- `` But it don't matter a-tall '' , Lord supplied fondly
me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams , an' the sweetest flower that grows ''
, he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her
away from him furiously
shut up

something to say to you , and by God you're going to listen
hear me
to listen ''
agreeably
he wanted very much to listen
that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as pleasin' to the ear , and he didn't want to miss a word of it
she mind speaking a little louder
think you stink , Tom Lord
you're mean and hateful and stupid , and -- louder ''


can hear you while I'm checkin' the car
we might be in for a speck of trouble ''
the door and got out
at the car side for a moment , looking down at her expectantly

goin' to say somethin' ''
helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence , `` Maybe you could write it down for me , huh
in real big letters , an' I can cipher it out later ''
, go on '' , she said
go the hell on ''
, nodded , and walked around to the front of the car
mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side
hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots , peered into the orderly chaos of axle , shock absorber , and spring
prone on his stomach , the better to pursue his examination
time , he straightened again , brushing the red Permian dust from his hands , slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored , twenty-five-dollar shirt
no gun -- a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country
he'd once told Joyce , had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun
really feels that way , she thought
all he's got , all he is
big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package
could make myself feel the same way She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; ; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis
the God-forsaken place , the westerly end of nowhere , Tom Lord looked almost insignificant , almost contemptible
handsome , with his coal-black hair and eyes , his fine-chiseled features
known plenty of handsomer guys , and , conceding his good looks , what was there left
a big man ; ; rather on the medium side
he very powerful of build
move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong
relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance
, she told herself
darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone
by gosh , I want him and I'm going to have him
her eye , came back around the car with the boot-wearer ; ; teetering , half-mincing walk
these yokels still wear boots , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse in years
in at her side , tucked a cigar into his mouth , and politely proffered one to her
, cut it out , Tom ''

you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute ''
ain't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested
maybe you just don't feel like a cigar ''
feel like getting back to town , that's what I feel like
are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk ''
get there faster walkin' '' , Lord drawled , `` seein' as how I got a busted front spring
other hand , howsomever , maybe you wouldn't either
it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk , and I c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours ''
-- with what

, ain't it the truth ''
with secret amusement
a danged thing but rattlesnakes , so I reckon I'll get the boss rattler to help me ''

sake ''
''
, cutting her off
that wildcat ''
it then , the distant derrick of the wildcat -- a test well in unexplored country
with her limited knowledge of such things , she knew that the car could be repaired there ; ; sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town
had to be prepared for almost any emergency
to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles and hours away from others
, let's get going '' , she said impatiently
'' -- She broke off , frowning
did you mean by that rattlesnake gag
boss rattlesnake to help you ''
, I meant what I said '' , Lord declared
else would I mean , anyways ''
at him , lips compressed
with a shrug of pretended indifference , she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up
mood , it was the best way to handle him ; ; that is , to show no curiosity whatsoever
she would be baited into a tantrum -- teased and provoked until she lost control of herself , and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood
lurched along at a snail's crawl , the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself
tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel
very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned
this self-satisfaction , however , Joyce sensed a growing tension
out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated
seen him like this once before -- more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion
the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company
been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time , just waiting to catch him out of line
him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip
a legitimate reason for wearing it
payday for Highlands , and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields
as long as the weapon was carried openly , the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it
what's this all about ''
, when Lord confronted him
the only man in town with a gun , or the only one without a permit ''
the wrong thing to say
to do as he was told instantly -- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car -- he had played into Lord's hands
was that he had virtually had to protest
had forced him to by his manner of accosting him
`` How about it ''

single me out on this permit deal ''
, I'll tell you about that '' , Lord told him
aim t' be see-lective , y'know
to bother no one unless we have to , which I figger we do , in your case
got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots ''

had heard that there was gangster money in the company , but that had nothing to do with him
an honest man doing a hard job , and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable
, Lord '' , he said hoarsely
know you've got a grudge against me , and maybe I can't blame you
that Highlands swindled you and I helped 'em do it
all wrong , man
lawyer
do what I'm told , and '' -- `` uh-huh
could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks
get rid of that pistol right now , Mis-ter McBride
that or take you out a permit right now ''
do either , of course
, as the deputy demanded
a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes
so would make his job well-nigh impossible
were a rough-tough lot
he exert authority over them -- make them toe the line , as he had to -- if he knuckled under to this small-town clown
get around to it a little later '' , he mumbled desperately
as soon as I go to the bank , and '' -- `` huh-uh
Mis-ter McBride '' , said Lord , and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm
strictly the deputy's game , but McBride had gone too far to throw in
he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck
off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront
practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition
him in the stomach , so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine
as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten , Lord straightened him with an uppercut
punch redoubled him
there was a numbing blow to the heart , and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach But he couldn't keep up with them
could he defend himself against them
to be fighting not one man but a dozen
could no longer think of face-saving , of honor , but only of escape
he's going to kill me , he thought wildly
him no harm
willful hurt to no man
just doing my job , just following orders , and for that he's going to kill me
to death in front of a hundred people
terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished
McBride , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord , would go scot-free , an officer who had only done his duty , though perhaps too energetically
into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust
fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again
see ; ; he was long past the point of coherent thinking
he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly
not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air
them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world
he was sure , was the way they would act ; ; laughing at a dying man , laughing as a man was beaten to death
would be done about it

of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda
tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire , rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes , lounged about
some idle talk , a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive
deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit
bothered the older hands
, Mateo Garcia , had arrived there long before the herd
a fire and put coffee on , and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon

family was setting up a separate camp nearby
unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon
gathered wood for a cookfire , and his wife was busy at it now
an eye on the twins and little Elena , trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing
at the younger children , attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon
had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it , which had been at midday
alone , without his wife and child
in an angry mood : Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him
what had taken place in town , between him and his wife
that she could talk to her mother about it
her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it
mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern
, get out of that creek

she called to the children , Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon
she called him -- as the Mexican hands did
in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , Luis Hernandez
are talking about

her that she probably would never know
she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward
tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs -- as though she were a little kid like Elena
moment , the three men were not saying much of anything
sitting on their heels , rider-fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon
hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him
a cigarette in his right hand
burning away , forgotten
was clouded with unhappiness
Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do
considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned

it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall
for cover both darkness and a summer storm
of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east
they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then , just outside Rockfork , they ran into rain
had slickers donned them
put on old coats or ducking jackets , whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles
seven of them , enough for a show of strength -- to run a bluff
to be nothing more than that
to be no gunplay
bluff failed and they ran into trouble , Brannon had told the others , they would withdraw -- and he would come after his son another time
want to put himself outside the law
were Hank Maguire , Luis Hernandez , and Luis's son Pedro
brothers were also along
man was Red Hogan , a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising
all good men
dark early , because of the storm
of the storm , the streets of Rockfork were deserted
glowed jewel-bright through the downpour
in before the town marshal's office , a box-sized building on Main Street
burned inside , but Brannon , peering through the window , saw that the office was empty
to catch Jesse Macklin there
just stepped out '' , he said
to have supper
come along
of you wait here ''
Hogan , he rode to the Welcome Cafe
down from the saddle and had a look inside
there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse
he's at the hotel ''
to the Rockfork House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street
in there , Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room
no slicker
on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked
felt no physical discomfort
only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain
noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder
, stopped on the hotel porch , lifted a hand in signal
and climbed the steps
finished eating '' , Hogan said
with a cup of coffee now
be long ''
long , at least to Tom Brannon
Hogan waited by the door , one to either side
the third man to come out , and he came unhurriedly
puffing on a cigar , and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain
not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them , and then it was too late
in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun
come along '' , Brannon told him
start anything you can't finish ''
, listen '' -- Macklin began
talk over at your office ''
, I warn you ''
go , Marshal '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm
the lawman's other arm
him down from the porch and through the rain to his office
five Slash-B men followed them inside , crowding the small room
was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms
at each of them in turn , Brannon last of all
remember you '' , he said
last one of you
you , Brannon '' -- `` Put your gun on the desk , Marshal ''
, hold on , damn it ; ; I won't '' -- Red Hogan's patience ran out
the skirt of Macklin's coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk
much fooling around '' , he said
press your luck , badge-toter ''
, `` Now the key to the lockup , Marshal ''
''

for ''
you guess ''

putting you where you won't come to harm
-- the key
out ''
if I will
you've assaulted a law officer and '' -- They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides
laid a hand on him , but the threat of violence was there
took on a sudden pallor , became beaded with sweat , and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing
out a moment longer , then his nerve gave under the pressure
, and said , `` All right
in my pocket ''
it out '' , Brannon ordered
as Macklin obeyed : `` Now let's go out back ''
Macklin turned to the back door
him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear
of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron
secured by an oversized padlock
again , not wanting to unlock and open the door
him in that threatening way once more , forced him to give in
door was open , they crowded him inside the dark building
uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door
to the street , mounted their horses , rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street
glowed with lamplight
Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark
to the edge of the veranda , peered down at them with his hand on his gun
try it '' , Brannon told him , dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following
get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you ''
past the now frightened man , entered the house
Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering
followed Brannon inside
him across the wide hallway to the parlor , four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house
to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle
mud on the oaken floor , on the carpet
fouled the elegance of that room
arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard
of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing
who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second
day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction
with a single exception , nothing had happened to them
was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis
out to his corral that morning , he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet
second later , the distant crack of a rifle had sounded
up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come
had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted
been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near
a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing
even pretended to be farming his spread
had never been plowed
done his rustling openly and boasted about it
received both first and second anonymous notices , and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them
cursed at them and threatened them
a man , those neighbors testified later , who didn't have a friend in the world
made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone
be ready next time ''

be shootin' right back ''
his chance the very next morning , for exactly the same thing happened again
Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area
nothing , but he still refused to give up and move out
let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face ''

all I ask ''
got that chance
unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time
smashed directly into the center of William Lewis' chest
against a log fence rail , then tried to lift himself
shots followed in quick succession , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground
was held , and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes , the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards
the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' Association meeting had leaked out by then , and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway , the prosecuting attorney , a Colonel Baird , ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning
some time to locate Horn
finally found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County , two counties away
immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment
indictment was never made
Horn , it turned out , had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing
scout's alibi couldn't be shaken
had to release him
rode on to Cheyenne , threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends
center at three hundred yards , that coroner said ''

shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground
there's two men in this state can shoot like that ''
he denied everything
he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin
blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do
was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their money's worth
many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats
herds were being raided less often , and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted
were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors
problem was by no means solved
the very area where the shooting had been done , cattle were still disappearing
than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on -- a blatant and defiant rustler named Fred Powell
was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle '' his own hired man , Andy Ross , mentioned later
knew it , but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it -- even after them notes came , even after he'd heard about Lewis , even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself ''
morning of September 10 , 1895 , Powell and Ross rose at dawn and began their day's work
was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack
team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed down and began chopping
had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded
around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest
man ran over to help his boss
God , I'm shot ''

collapsed and died instantly
no intention of searching for the assassin
the dead man onto the buckboard , yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast
brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing
scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place
no tracks of either hoofs or boots
an empty cartridge case could be found
, Tom Horn was the first and most likely suspect , and he was brought in for questioning immediately
, he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready
riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of Cheyenne , he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made
cow thieves is just a business proposition with me '' , he'd blandly announce
I sort o' got a corner on the market ''
'' , a friend asked him once , `` how come you bushwhacked them rustlers
o' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down ''
lots of friends , then as always
he became widely known as a professional killer , nearly every cowboy and rancher in Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend
name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo
'' , he explained , `` s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope
you be most scairt of -- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down ''
, I can see that '' , the friend was forced to agree
well , it just don't seem sportin' somehow ''
''
sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement
''
again in soft wonder
seen a lot o' things in my time
a trooper once the Apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill , and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls
o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death
one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just don't think there is , and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man ''
first two murders , the warning notes were rarely ignored
had been learned
were plain
Powell's brother-in-law , Charlie Keane , moved into the dead man's home , the anonymous letter writer took no chances on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice : If you don't leave this country within 3 days , your life will be taken the same as Powell's was
the message found tacked to the cabin door
, within three days
Albany and Laramie counties , other men were doing the same
settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds growing high in their yards
half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow
thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer
judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere , at any time , to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated
straight years , Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming pastures , and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell ( if he killed Lewis and Powell ) will never be known
possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state
also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him
legend was growing explosively , Rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man
best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $125 , very good money in an era when top hands worked for $30 and found
had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark
detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest
thing was certain -- his method was effective , so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary
fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week
reputation's my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more than once
couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end
made himself the personification of the Devil to the homesteaders
the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure
as Coble and Clay and the Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown
their spreads his headquarters , and he helped out in their roundups
cow camps , Tom Horn was regarded as a hero , as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos
and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range , waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life
, guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him
, rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in Wyoming
minutes had passed and Curt hadn't emerged from the livery stable , Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter
have a little job for you , Charlie
you won't mind doing me a small favor ''
was oily , but Summers wasn't fooled
his lips uneasily
is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner ''
carelessly
very simple
want you to take a message to Diane Molinari
to come here to the hotel ''
, Summers nodded and started toward the door
thing , Summers '' , Brenner said
not to mention my name
Curt Adams wants to see her ''
up short , and turned around
don't know , Mr. Brenner '' , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans
doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that
just '' -- His voice trailed off into silence
to smile , but his eyes were cold
and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed
know , Summers '' , he said thoughtfully
Nest ought to have a fire company
were to drop a match in here , this place would go up like a haystack ''
toward the stairway , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to Adams's room , that Adams is in trouble
to hurry ''
sir ''
pale , Summers headed for the street
to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching
only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right , then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside
that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong , but Curt didn't interpret it this way
like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed
horse would be close to where he was hiding
back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street
the place cautiously , and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees
a light in Black's front room , but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior
the house and located a barn out back
hear horses moving around inside , and nothing else
no lock on the door , only an iron hook which he unfastened
the door and went in , pulling it shut behind him
stood in the darkness listening , but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor
ahead carefully , his left hand in front of him , and came to a wooden partition
was very strong , and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws
a match in his pocket and lit it
two horses in the barn , a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin
out the match
certain now that Jess was in the house , but also , presumably , was Stacey Black
to get Jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner
the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved
the side of the stall , he slapped the buckskin on the rump
animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall
had hoped , the house door banged open
the buckskin again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs rattling the side of the stall
over beside the door and waited
heard footsteps crossing the yard , and Jess's smothered curses
swung open , and Jess said sourly , `` What the hell's the matter with you
horse continued to snort
that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice
again , and entered the barn
flared , and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop
crossed to the side of the stall , Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer
you try anything '' , he said
what happened to Gruller ''
his breath in surprise
to reach for his gun , but apparently thought better of it
the stuff '' , Curt said
hold it that way ''
out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt
and I have a little talking to do , Jess
be needing this ''
up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster
you , Adams '' -- Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock
ain't got nothing to talk about
don't come back in the house , Breed's going to '' -- `` Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house
he's probably having supper
ride the four of you took must've given him a good appetite
around so I can see your face ''

raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen
about as dumb as they come , Adams
know what you're up to , but when Brenner '' -- `` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said
Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about ''
''

don't know nothin' about him ''

you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four , either ; ; one with blood all over it , Arbuckle's blood ''
put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun
help me , Crouch , I'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I'm going to hear you admit killing him
talking
you to do it
Dutch Brenner ''
holding Jess's gun in his left hand
back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face , but didn't finish the motion
unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess , but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it
this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage , Jess became bold
all the guns makes you a big man , don't it , Adams
was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough ''
''
out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster
a step and holstered his own
right , Crouch ; ; we're on even terms
''
out on Jess's swarthy face
of his right hand twisted into a claw , but he didn't reach for the gun
angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high
this make it any easier , coward ''
ain't drawin' against you '' , Jess said thickly
heard how you outdrew Chico
a gunslinger ''

kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club
wanted to hear you say so ''
at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides
found Curt's weakness , or what to Jess was a weakness , and was smart enough to take advantage of it
the distance , a woman screamed
too involved in his own problems to pay much attention
to make Jess talk , and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate
he lifted Jess's gun from its holster , only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin
his own beside it
do it another way , then '' , he said harshly
features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist
roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack
to duck beneath the man's flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section
like hitting a sack of salt
up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit
into the wall , bounced back , and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning
lower and it would have knocked him out
was , his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move
eyes began to focus , he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork
to one side , and the tines of the fork bit into the floor
a few seconds trying to yank them loose
Curt time to stagger to his feet
broke off under Jess's twisting , and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out
was hurried ; ; so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head
Curt was seeing clearly again
inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them
Jess double over
head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall
shook , setting the lantern to swaying , and the buckskin to pitching again
old crowbait began to snort , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess
on out there ''
seem too sure himself
drunkenly to his feet , lowered his head , and took one step away from the wall
him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor
had enough
from his nose , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists
in almost as bad shape , but he wouldn't quit
Jess into a corner , grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront , and drew back his right fist
me about Arbuckle
him , didn't you ''
was Brenner's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose
found out about you and Arbuckle talking
to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble ''
mean anyone who stood up for his rights '' , Curt said
go of the shirt , and Jess slumped to the floor
back , Curt crossed to the stall , reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope , and waved his hand in the animal's face
bolted out of the stall
in and picked up his gun
loose straw out of the action , and placed the gun in his holster
where it lay , he left the stall
up , Crouch
someplace ''
got to his feet as someone rattled the door
in there ''
fearfully
the door , grabbed Black by the shoulder , and pulled him into the barn
staying right here for a while
coward just admitted killing Arbuckle
to let him tell it to somebody else ''
Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess
out of here
along peacefully , or I'll put a bullet in your leg ''
through the door
, reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it
have little trouble getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes
you takin' me ''
worriedly
going to Marshal Woods's house
the marshal hears this himself , it'll make a difference
this town must still have some backbone ''
shoulder he could see Max's loose grin and the Burnsides' glowering faces
'' , he whispered
as we send them on their way and make camp , let's you and me go for a walk down by the Snake -- all by ourselves ''
'' , admonished her mother , `` you've got all evening to visit with Dan
need dressing now ''
words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting
spectacle he was , caked with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian , kissing the finest , the sweetest , the bravest , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world
her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap
a lot to tend to , but I'll get back quick as I can '' , he assured her
hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen
doing most of the talking
as Sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle , Dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth
the Burnsides moved on , he'd lead Rex down by the river ; ; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening
, he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve
hadn't got Nate stopped when I did , my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell
, picked up his ruined hat , and pursed his lips thoughtfully
way the wound in his head was itching , Dan knew that it would heal
only hat was something else again



, now ready to roll , were purposefully deaf to his cry
''
to the retreating back directly in front of him
ain't going to fight you no more ''
his head , attempting to speak in a soothing voice
know you ain't ''
, feeling ten feet tall
in close , jerked the handsome , broad-brimmed beaver hat from Nate's head and clamped it on his own
a present for you '' , he said , shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate's purpling forehead
and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by ''
her choring to stand beside Dan
hand in his , they silently watched the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight
they had to look forward to , they didn't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go
Matilda could not believe her own eyes
spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness
she could see him , looking uncommon handsome , standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon
waiting there at the foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that , for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them , Matilda could not speak at all
with a glory that almost wiped out the deep , downward sags in her careworn face , Matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to Hez , who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon `` Pa

see Dan
with the Jacksons ''
about Burnsides ''
, who still believed they'd have them to lick
ain't even in sight ''

Hez could see for himself , and so could the others
were all shouting greetings , exchanging smiles , and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again
a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day
they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle , tended the cattle , tethered the horses , gathered fuel , carried water , and started their cooking fires
and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news
did they hear of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action
in his scalp was examined , pronounced healing , and well doctored with simples , before they dished up the victuals
on , in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood , the whole group settled down to relish their food
, in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome , followed the old taboo of `` quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag ''
supper , the evening turned into a regular `` Hoe-Down ''
they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration
Bill O'Connor on the fiddle , and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting `` Glory Be '' and `` Hallelujah '' above their united chant of the lilting old ballads , they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration
'' , Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators , `` don't that fiddle make you wish the Bible didn't say us Baptists can't dance ''
Methodists , neither '' , she replied
that it matters to me , being this far along ''
her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied
spring , you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too , gal ''
words of sympathy and understanding , Harmony said generously , `` I don't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and join in the games ''
his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , `` I ain't much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell , but I'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles ''
down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers
reckon there's nobody out there , 'cept maybe Dan , who can outgrip me , Harmony ''
on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally
was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , `` Farmer in the dell , Farmer in the dell , Heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell ''
sight of Sally's happy face and carefree expression , Harmony's dark , brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears
glad , completely and unselfishly glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan
really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for Rod
couldn't , not yet
the memory of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close
the center of the circle the farmer , who was Dan , wasted no time when they came to the line , `` The farmer choose his wife ''
swift swoop of his big arms , he grabbed Sally out of the circle surrounding him , and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their `` outfit ''
child , the dog , the cat and even the cheese , all joined them out there in the circle
Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them
how many registry rocks they came to on this journey , each one exerted its own appeal
names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness
few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks , leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains
saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them
were they through and the guards posted , than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep
, it was the first she had known in many a night
knowledge that she was losing another boy , as a mother always does when a marriage is made , did not prevent her from having the first carefree , dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear Valley , way , way back there when they were crossing those other mountains
, they moved on again
souls' a-gracious ''
exclaimed , watching their rippling muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load
body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud ''
Dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins
, Gran '' , they said almost in unison
wasn't nothing at all ''
in her chair , Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dan's face
Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising ''
ragging him , Gran '' , Rod protested
ain't ragging him ''
again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing Dan's upper lip
honest-to-Betsy , I've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon ''
tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold snack and water jug , placed the chamber pot beside her feet , and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice
worse , Pa ''
Hez , who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends
right leg's stiff as a board this morning '' , he replied
the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling ''
men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens' signal
up at the high face of Emigrant Rock , official signboard for the Raft River turnoff , and gloated , `` Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar ''
what made them hurry so '' , Rod drawled , giving Dan a sly wink
, and changed the subject
now on , Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's outfit ''
no sense you eating our dust '' , Rod protested
and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along '' , Dan explained
recruited his critters , and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up
the tightest running gear in the train now
'tain't no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen , so's I can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch ''
signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams
ye're right , Dan '' , Hez called back over his shoulder
shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon ''
apprehensively ahead at the narrowing , precipice-walled gorge
double teams zigzagging up the mountain , Harmony '' , he spoke reassuringly , concerned by the pinched look around her mouth
enough we'll all be up on top by sundown ''
the corner of his eye , he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn
had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs
larger than Dutch Springs , this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous
the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about
were forced to maintain a sharper watch , this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them
be holdin' forth in some bar if he's here at all '' , Cobb declared , glancing along the street as they stretched their legs
no less than six or seven saloons in Ganado , not counting the lower class dives , all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters
nodded
one side of the street , and I'll take the other '' , he proposed
you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in ''
was tight
do the same
I ask , Stevens ''
they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars
two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero
seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually , even were he to prove the thief
out of the Miners Rest with his hopes plummeting , and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon , the last place of any consequence on this side of the street
was an elaborate establishment , built practically on stilts in front , with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch
ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside
up the steps quickly to the plank porch
windows of the place were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior
the batwings , Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window , and suddenly dodged aside
as a bowstring , he paused to gather his wits
expectation , Carmer was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him
surged through Russ
down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot
porch rail beyond view of the bar windows , he feverishly scanned the busy street below
nowhere in sight
exclamation , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down
had it , he had not gone twenty feet in the street before Pat appeared
luck , Cobb ''
swiftly
upward
there '' , he got out tersely , curbing his rising excitement
cartridge belt around , Pat glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb at his side
steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door
through first
him momentarily , Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside
widened
minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry , with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday
was nowhere to be seen
knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track , and another dozed at one of the card tables
murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar , while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass
setup over , Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place
yuh goin' ''
the barkeep
Pat turned to survey him deliberately
not reply , going on toward the back
than the tall , wide-shouldered man in the lead , Cobb followed alertly , a hand on his gun butt
measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it
no more
opened in back of the bar , running toward an ell
into it
, probably for cards , opened off on either side
doors were open at this hour except one , and it was toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder
was locked
kick made it spring open , shuddering
Gyp Carmer staggering forward , a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike
through to bat it nimbly aside
bellow Carmer lunged at him
was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled
a single powerful jab that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan
to struggle up , heaving desperately
him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach
Cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back , holding him pinned
, Stevens
his fangs '' , he snapped
through his pockets , will you
have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of ''
, Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing
this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment
grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer's hat , which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell
it
, his eyes ablaze , he held out the battered Stetson
at this ''
crown , stuffed behind the stained sweatband , could be seen thin , crumpled wads of currency
cache for his loot had been found
golly , Stevens
right '' , Russ exclaimed , tearing the loose bills out of Carmer's hat
is , if we can be sure this is Colcord's money '' -- Pat grunted
else would he get it
you've got there , Cobb
soon tell ''
through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly

within a hundred of what Crip had '' , he declared
know Penny spent some -- and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on ''
money over , Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean
at Gyp Carmer was disdainful
we get out of here ''
card room , they moved back through the Palace the way they had come
met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them
the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out
Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street
till they reached their horses
there , looking across at the young fellow
a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord and tell him about it , Russ ''
to return it
faint surprise Russ held up his hand
me '' , he ruled decidedly
enough
you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens '' , he pursued strictly
shove along home ''
you say ''
into the saddle , yet still he delayed , his brows puckered
owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly
Crip wasn't '' , retorted Cobb tartly
know when you tell him
want this to sink in awhile
next time he won't be so quick on the trigger ''
had never pretended to give advice in such affairs
the doctor '' , he returned with a smile
I still think Penny's an awful nice girl , Russ '' -- `` You don't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb
other a dark look , he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street
him go , following more leisurely
first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner , and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for Antler
was , the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck
always glad to see me over there '' , he mused bleakly
he not visited the girl at Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle
above that , however , was his growing suspicion of Chuck Stober's part in recent events
Carmer couldn't have known about Colcord's money unless he was told -- and who else would have told him ''
himself
the second time War Ax hands made a play for that money
of an accident could that be ''
, he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun
no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ; but on the range gunfire had a meaning
, Russ listened carefully
later it came again -- a double explosion , followed by a third , sounding more distant
as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house
up in a twinkling
as he knew , only his father could be there
it mean
to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter , with growing alarm
glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing
quarter-mile away , the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed
course straight for the house , he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face
was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression
now what he was up against
out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the Antler house and , having spotted his approach , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight
for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot , Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly
wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer a moment later
this way
gone far ''
cry floated to him across the brush
cracked more loudly , and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side
assassin had his position figured pretty close
Russ looked about hastily
west this depression led toward a draw
pony , he hurried that way , not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range
then , and bending forward over the horn , he urged his mount down the meandering draw
not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind
been sighted , and his attacker pumping shot after shot
or two went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot
had torn half of his stirrup-guard away
twitched his shirtsleeve , and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm
close overhead
Jerusalem
out of here ''
first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw
minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless
look around , he saw that he was safe for the moment
cries from behind him , but he could make out no words
madly for the next elbow turn in the draw , and made it
the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw , he plunged forward with undiminished speed
wash climbed upward , forcing him toward open range
must chance it
out of the dwindling wash , the loose dirt flying behind him , and flashed a look about
November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions
Squadron put its first marks on the combat record
that could fly was sent into the air
eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan
enemy flew or floated was his target
eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf area , with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships
took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte
carried two five-hundred pound bombs
carrier took Greg , Todman , Belton , Banjo Ferguson , and Walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip
a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes
had much to say
glowered down at them
a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever
dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle
Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it
was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot
into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before
hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure
got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan said , as he dropped the straps of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders
this goddamn climate
carabao not airplanes ''
make out
worry , chief '' , Greg replied , wondering if he himself believed it

'' , Donovan said as he jumped off the wing
was his trade-mark , his open sesame to good luck , and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return
prearranged time , Greg started the engine and taxied out
time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight , he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip
where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission
before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky
down the rough metal taxi strip , and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him
brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful
heads looked ridiculously small
tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan
was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again
west , the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes
the sea was a dark and muddied gray
against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers
strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it
the fighter pilot's horror of bad weather and instrument flying , and he wondered , if the ceiling did drop , whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory
in the warm cockpit
was solid above him
as he could see there was no hole to climb through it
have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar and hope that it didn't close in before they returned
the radio button on his throttle
, let's try to go under this stuff
close and we'll go up the valley ''
, Sweeney '' , Todman called back , and pulled his four in and slightly above Greg
the formation wide around three A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf
down to five hundred feet , swinging a little north of the city of Tacloban , and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain
was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn
only a fifteen-minute flight , but before it was through Greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia
stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in
other pilots were worried , they did not show it
remained perfect
sea was visible ahead of them , the relief was as great as if the sun had come out
the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast
drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity
thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him
beat us to it ''
over the radio as he came back up in formation
to be limited , and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet
frustrating
were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights
once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill
area remained as placid as a Florida dawn
as time began to run out , he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies
clouds made bombing difficult
not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run
was deplorable
Greg's bombs hung up , and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it
of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle
load of bombs gone , the planes moved swiftly and easily
up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home
it was still open
man making a deep dive , Greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley
about to make a gas check on his flight when Todman's voice broke in : `` Sweeneys

level ''
flicked up from his instrument panel
them , specks against the gray , but closing fast
headed straight for each other on a collision course
enemy
old question
a few seconds to answer it
''
excitedly , and hopefully
he thought Todman might be right
flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification
the shape down to two : either a Zero or a U. S. Navy type aircraft
were the enemy , tactically his position was correct
were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower
maximum altitude , up against the overcast , gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages
also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn't been spotted already
closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course
, Greg made his decision
the radio button
Blue , hit the deck
throttle
you take the one on the left
the middle
the one on the right
Japs
sure first ''
the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two `` Rogers ''
, light with most of the gas burned out , responded beautifully
indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees
aircraft continued to come on
to be the enemy
the Air Corps had continued to camouflage planes
, of course , no way for the other planes to get by them
a box
could turn and escape to the east
the radio button again
, drop your second element back
of us miss , they can pick up the pieces
make sure they're Japs ''
he said it , Greg knew they had found the enemy
were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom
his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight
with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him
shook
your guns , Sweeneys ''
Japs
'' , came a high-pitched voice
to Sweeney Blue
only

your ass in this canyon
order ''
the flights over against one wall
them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery
turn was too tight , a barrel roll would bring them out
of an altitude for a barrel roll , but it could be done
his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the RPM , and the engine responded as if it had been waiting
identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around
haven't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise
haven't seen us ''
the radio button
, Sweeneys , now
'em home ''
back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag
the corner of his eye , he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him
he thought
rapid rate of closure , the approach from below , the side , and ahead , there would be only a moment when damage could be done
shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board
his turn
up
going to be dangerous
in this small box
dear God , make my pilots good , he prayed
a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another
did not veer
not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted


closed on the stick trigger
rumbled and slowed
lines etched their way into the gray and vanished
drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them
his turn until the plane shuddered
with him
held for a second on the engine section of the plane
propeller flew off in pieces
piece of engine cowling vanished
all Greg had time to see
for the shot had placed him near the overcast , almost inverted and heading up into the clouds
was dropping rapidly
spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground
stay clear , he prayed
stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back
the panic of vertigo
no idea which was up and which was down
the controls where they had been
out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip
speed dropped until he thought he would spin out
rattling of fenders , humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles
moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation , and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat
'' , my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone I once more repeated the absurdity , mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced
coming to an intersection , turning right , chuffing to a stop
realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican : Moriarty , New Mexico

, I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters
with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass
saw the father's head slightly turn ; ; gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold
past
conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze
treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumbing hopefully , I saw emergent in windshield flash : red lips , streaming silk of blonde hair and -- ah , trembling confusion of hope , apprehension , despair -- the leering face of old Herry
'' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde
rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where -- hidden -- more delicately-textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes
luck
have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and -- Well , at least I wouldn't have shouted back a taunt
anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me
stopping
I straightened up with my duffel bag , I heard : `` Sahjunt Yoorick , meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck ''
was that of Johnson , tail gunner off another crew
look between Johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired `` Y'all drahve ''

one thiihng '' , Mrs. Roebuck continued
goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe , an y'all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt
Johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im ''
that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew
I knew will shortly become apparent
pass over the trip to Sante Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs. Roebuck `` wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit '' ( 35 m.p.h. ) `` is still in ee-faket ''
up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 m.p.h. which would , I hoped , overhaul Herry and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I , Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe
ejaculated `` Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola , Ma'am ''
smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son , who was `` onleh a little younguh than you bawhs ''
would have believed she had a son that age
thought Johnson was a `` sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet '' , but her Herman was getting to be a man , there was no getting around it
befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh , Major Roebuck an Ah , an Huhmun says ' May Ah hev one too '

, I don't '' , Johnson said
a good Baptist , and drinking '' Mrs. Roebuck very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road which would , she said , lead us to Taos and then Raton and `` eventshahleh '' out of New Mexico
her `` eventshah-leh '' passed into the crannies where I was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus , and how the word would echo

Mrs. Roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck , father or grandfather of Senor `` Moriarty's '' Ford sedan , came screeching to a dust-swirling stop , and a brown face appeared , its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window
in , buddies
''
, black hair flopped in a vigorous nod , the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back
the right hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely loosely-taped fragments of glass , and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer
back , buddy '' , the driver said to me
carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack , I stepped on the running board ; ; it flopped down , sprang back up and gouged my shin
was hurtling forward
the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time , one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag -- and merely wrecking my camera , I was to discover later -- my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and -- but this is no medical report
again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck's similarity to Senor X's Ford turtle
would beat old Herry to Siberia after all
that might offer
my leg
back , drawing back my foot for a kick
was only Johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing , which half covered the truck cab's glassless rear window
his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth I thought he was only having a little joke , but , no , he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear
beer ''
, yes '' , I roared back between dusty lips
want a beer
anteater want ants
, amigo
, I hollered , my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary
my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took to be Spanish , but -- the driver's white teeth flashing at me , the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair , beyond his gesticulating bottle -- it could have been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing ; ; I wouldn't have known the difference
trying to grab the wheel , though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it
suddenly vanishing , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear
off the road , gleaming barbed wire pulling taut
just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards
in a field , in a tight , screeching turn
were popping up and popping down
fell on my back , I saw a vulture hovering
I got to my knees , there was again the sound of the fence stretching , and I had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously
no wire came whipping into the truck
back on the road
my squatting position behind the truck cab's rear window
hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers
'' , the driver cackled , his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing
was Tee-wah I was talking
I was a Mexican , didn't you , buddy ''

, that's all right , buddy '' , the Indian ( I now guessed ) said
your beer ''
the bottle was still in my hand , foam still geysering over my ( luckily ) waterproof watch
had I started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck
foamed furiously
furiously
time
bottle
flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound
my head each time it appeared
Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision , `` son of a bitch '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering ribs
car was approaching , its chrome teeth grinning
the gray road stretched a long , long way
was just about to us , its driver's fat , solemn face intent on the road ahead , on business , on a family in Sante Fe -- on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue
the bottle
so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof

roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash
''
was again raising his bottle , but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of Johnson's -- the bottle this time went to the Indian's lips
was coming , a tiny , dark shape on a far hill
looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board , a dirt clod -- anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle
slowing
ditch sand was white and soft-looking , only an occasional pebble discernible , faintly gleaming
couldn't quickly unwire the truck door , and if I escaped , he might suffer
was approaching fast
truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery ; ; with more time I could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin -- Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket
no time to pick out a penny ; ; I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger , leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile
a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash ; ; the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center
the screech of brakes behind me , an insane burst of laughter beneath me
I saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number
''
hand , another bottle were protruding from the truck cab , and that self-proclaimed Baptist teetotaler , had a bottle at his own lips
came over a crest , their chrome and glass flashing
arm whipped sidewise -- there was a flash of amber and froth , the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car
behind us
Johnson's bottle snatched from his hand , saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car
there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women
back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window
, you son of a bitch ''
turned around and began to drink
Indian was jabbing another bottle toward Johnson
her to the divan , turned off the TV , faced her
quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes
eyes they were
dark , a melting , golden brown
hot honey , eyes that sizzled
skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them
a disturbingly familiar face , too , but I couldn't remember where we had met
, `` Do we know each other , Miss ''
, I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was '' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself
sorry
go on ''

her first smile
waiting for
''

one word at a time , O.K. ''
still hugging the stained coat around her , so I said , `` Relax , let me take your things
like a drink , or coffee ''
, thanks ''
up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let out a high-pitched scream and I let out a low-pitched , wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out
wearing nothing beneath the coat
the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough
been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out , and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before
forgot ''

, do forgive me
''
forgive '' -- `` That's what started all the trouble in the first place
dear , I'm all unstrung ''
and me both , dear
haven't I seen you
, surely we've '' -- `` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said
done several filmed commercials for '' -- Then it hit me
''

, yes
recognized me ''
, indeed
, I was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell
you rang -- it was in color , too , Miss , and Miss
name , anyway
you were splendid ''
by her on the divan

waterfall and all that ''
the last one we did
a fun one ''
bet
fun for me , all right
mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles
: Is advertising honest
depends on who does it
wear anything at all
-- wouldn't seem fair , somehow ''
couldn't agree with you more ''
really do have something important to tell you , Mr. Scott
murder ''

yeah '' , I said
me about the murder ''
me
the creation of two men , Louis Thor and Bill Blake , partners in zing

the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign -- sales had soared practically into orbit
had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping , the A.M.A. , and the Veterinary Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you didn't bathe
caller -- Joyce Holland was her name -- had previously done three filmed commercials for zing , and this evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor
in Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds -- fashioned , of course , from zing -- Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled
-- and drastically cut -- product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; ; even to clean men and boys
on , `` When we'd finished , Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked me to stay a little longer
a few stills for magazine ads , he said
and I stayed in the pool , then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too
didn't have any clothes on ''
didn't ''
, he didn't
I mean ''

leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on
it was evident what he had in mind ''
got away , didn't you ''

up with me once and grabbed me , but I was all covered with zing -- it's very slippery , you know ''
didn't know
have the stuff in the house
pleased to hear '' -- `` So I just scooted out of his clutches
like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car
were still in it , and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I'd changed ''
around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time , she'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool
yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge
on : `` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up
was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead
shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana
walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive
so scared well , I just ran to my car and came here ''
know who the other man was ''
, I never did see his face
get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit
sure the other one was Lou ''
wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification
I'd have to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name
in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits
Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor's wife , Mrs. Oatnut Grits
least not to Joyce
I so want the part '' , she said
commercials have just been for money , there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them , but in Underwater Western Eye I'd have a chance to act
show what I can do ''
as I was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do
promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort
relieved , she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom
got my Colt Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room
a little on the divan
starting to itch '' , she said
''
, I'm still all covered with that soap
loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off
it sure itches ''
might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like ''
, I'd love to ''
her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub
relaxes me
you ''
when I do it ''
my head
my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color
as long as you want , Joyce
be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you
have everything all to yourself , doggone '' I looked at my watch
nine
go , I supposed
, goodbye '' , I said

hurry ''
, you can count on that ''
slightly


hurry too much
soaking for at least half an hour ''
all she said
those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them
when there's a job to be done , I'm a monstrosity of grim determination , I like to think
about and clattered through the front room to the door
went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower

be taking a cold shower
she couldn't
Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan , and it took me less than five minutes to get there
scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected
were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars
in the big house and surrounding grounds
a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool
officers , a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left
pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather
yards beyond the group of men , a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra
, one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me
you hear about this one ''
, but ignored the question
push it ; ; Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years
me in
to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M. , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now
the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been Thor's partner Bill Blake , and Antony Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account
them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier
were they doing here ''
Rawlins
were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff ''
, I've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately
the gunk ''
would I know
secret
the new advertising angle -- something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient
only two men know what the formula is , Blake and '' -- He stopped and looked at Thor's body
, `` O.K. , so now only Blake knows
strike you , foul or fair ''
say yet
says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em
might show he drowned instead , but that's what the once-over-lightly gives us
murder , suicide -- take your pick ''
pick murder
''
to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out
people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living ; ; this is not so , for education offers all kinds of dividends , including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife
were not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have been stymied on what to do , and now I understand why they are classics ; ; those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick
for my Uncle ( an Uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest ) who ran one of those antique shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre , the old French Quarter
I had with him was to work four hours a day
of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting
a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun
come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college , partly because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there
Uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted
turned out to be excellent
the city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras
seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide , joyous celebration with romance in the air ; ; and , when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner
faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure
as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes , cover their faces with masks and go adventuring
and I were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages
wondered vaguely what he did about women for my Aunt , by blood , had died some years ago , but neither of us said anything
morning I saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt
married over the week-end , though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty
more like twenty-five or six
really a May and December combination
Aunt was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long time since I had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex
something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me
were the full , sexy kind , full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite ; ; the calf was magnificent , the ankle perfect
forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body
artist is like one of those scientists who , from a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body
looks at an ankle , a calf , a bosom and , in his mind's eye , the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is
is the way I first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store
impressed me instantly was obvious ; ; I was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them
I saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks
she was my Aunt , married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage , but why she had married a man twice her age , and more , perhaps , I did not know or much care
standing with her back to the glass door
was silhouetted and with the strong light I could see the outlines of her body , a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired
is in so many affairs of the heart , a man and a woman meet and something clicks
in this instance , but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew it , for we both kept our distance
appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it
I became aware that she , too , glanced at me surreptitiously
that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model
these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship
eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of `` Me , too ''
probably experienced this
nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity
married him I do not know
was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me
had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living
with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ; or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father ; ; some women with father fixations do
weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home ; ; his bride opened the store
waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition
she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights
depth , cluttered with antiques , echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk
her palms , fingers outspread , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` Now , what next ''
aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune
little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour
standing beside her , watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped
and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up , and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush
, which had been so much in my thoughts , was warm and moist and tender
her murmur , `` We'd better lock the door ''
not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch
opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said : `` He will not always be indisposed ''
know
thinking about that
we work it out ''
don't know '' , she said
the man
it out
the way you've been looking at me ever since we met ''
guess we both felt it ''

guess so '' , she said
now what ''
I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable
know what we can do '' , I said
him I made a pass at you ''
a protesting hand with a startled air
are you trying to do
out
even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew ''
don't want to be thrown out and I don't think I will
I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us ''
telling him you are making passes at me ''
incredulously
I was in college '' , I grinned , `` I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class
even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets
days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell ; ; and now I think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us
Gras opens officially
of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks , and having a ball
be romance and flirtation
tell him I made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said or did , so instead of just telling him I made a pass , say I tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse I really am
a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near Lake Ponchartrain
prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead
both the same size
use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask
show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it ''
you '' -- she began
worry about me
turn out all right ''
don't understand '' , she insisted
you trying to cut your throat ''
'' , I chuckled , `` I'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education ''
expected , on the following day my Uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning
that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be , but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife
work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days
subsequently that my Uncle and Aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the French Quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date
nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view
minutes later I saw my Uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner
say the figure was well made up
were not that I knew who it was I could have mistaken it for my Aunt so well did her clothes fit him
hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain
why he brought it along
half darkness I approached cautiously , making sure he did not see me
looking out on the dark waters of the Lake when I came upon him and without wasting words I smacked him hard across the face
cheap bitch ''

cheap , no good , two-timing bitch
a good , loyal husband -- smack
you fall for a pass by his own nephew
-- smack
ashamed of yourself
better write a postcard to Walter
the myth book again and there ( along the margin next to Robert Graves' imaginative interpretation of the creation of the Dactyls from Rhea's fingertips ) were the names of four Munich bars and Meredith Wilder's address
were marked as Walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer
, which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest , Nicolas was determined to find out and put to use
to Walter would get him an introduction to this Meredith , and that might be good for something
on his muse , a line came back : `` Squaresville , man , and all the palazzos are crummy Palasts ''
to draw a laugh , Nicolas reasoned , as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind
, his postcard did draw from Walter a letter recommending his friend , the poet Nicolas Manas , to his friend Meredith Wilder
later , on receiving it , Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table

cried
was large and square and heavily tanned
crying in him was the voice of guilt
weeks in Italy had turned into nearer three months
returned to the pension a week ago
he was just in the late poems of Holderlin and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him -- plus next semester's class preparation
determined to spend an industrious summer
maybe Manas wouldn't call
slowed and stopped over a line before him : Sie lacheln , die Schwarzen Hexen
of Manas gradually faded as Meredith asked himself should he translate it , ' How the dark fates laughed '
more rhythmically , ' The swarthy witches are laughing '
missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape Nicolas Manas
, too , was being interrupted , that morning
the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the English Gardens and sent him off to sleep ; ; but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him
wake him
have the heart
, her maternal feeling , in fact her being was too busy expressing itself , as quietly thrilled by this sight of her Nicolas curled asleep under a blanket , in a park like a scene from Poussin
just not able to break the spell
she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer Nicolas had found his first night in one of Walter's marked bars
`` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see
all these beers was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money ''
: Protests , tears , and `` take what you want , Nicolas , I am a dancer , you are a poet , it is all beautiful ''
meek conjugation Nicolas had replied , `` O.K. I can use this blanket
you get off this job tonight , well , you can gimme something to eat ''
as a matter of fact , Nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night , when he discovered that Munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew
always known how to find a bed , and on his own terms
the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions
Lerner knew none of this
Nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn , black hair falling over his eyes
telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth
surely a reunion in art , it was all that poetry promised
night with Nicolas and marijuana in Venice had opened her eyes
, his voice saying his poems , the fact that he had not so much as touched her -- on the contrary , he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair -- this was all new
had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith
day he was gone
might not be the most intelligent woman , but she was one of the most determined
, it took her several days to force Walter to tell her Nicolas's whereabouts
small suitcase , informing her husband whom she found in Harry's Bar that she was taking a train to Germany to get away for a while , patting his arm , refusing a drink , getting on the train -- all this had only taken her two hours
arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens
girl '' , Walter had finally said , `` he writes me that he is sleeping in the English Gardens ''
like him ''
had smilingly said
address '' , Walter added , `` is that great foundling home , the American Express
will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband
the last half hour Mary Jane had criss-crossed half the length of the Gardens and , at last , come upon her knight
there , asleep in the grass , confirmed all that Mary Jane believed it was in his power to teach her : freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels , the meaning of nature , how to live , simply , with the angels
down her suitcase
wake him

she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched
grew hotter as it approached the midday
dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car
sweating
dream he cried , `` Slow down , for Chrissake ''
woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass
was tickled

his nose expertly between his fingers

sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then , more vigorously , between his legs
, he stretched
got up , quietly , and walked away
later she was at the desk of the Grafin's pension , her tears dried , signing a hotel form and asking for a bath
belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities
retreated to this world
, who was charmed by her , told her , `` Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair
very interesting
there is no bath
young American has a bath next to his room and I shall ask him if you might use it this once
we shall see
The Grafin was partial to the word shall
was irritated when the Grafin knocked at his door and told him , `` She is a great beauty
allow her not to have a bath
she is a sad beauty , I believe
see her at dinner ''
he listened to the bath water running ; ; when it stopped he began busily typing , sitting up in a virtuous way
, he shaved for the second time that day
he did not like doing , generally
the mirror and his interested eyes , he was pleased to note , when he stripped for his own bath , that he still had the best part of his Italian sun tan
his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed
small gallery used as the guests' dining room , Meredith sat down at his place and , as always , began teasing the young waitress
asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets ( she also served as maid ) when he saw the Grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table
be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he , oh , dropped his napkin , so startled was he by Mary Jane's beauty
did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the Grafin as acknowledgement that here , indeed , was something special
had made very little effort
dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with , as he soon perceived , no brassiere beneath
blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders
eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day
touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual
was grace and modesty
was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control
falling in love
`` Only this morning '' ; ; veal cutlets : `` Oh , I couldn't possibly eat all this ''
Wine : `` Then you were typing poems this afternoon ''
Fruit compote : `` If you think I would understand it '' ; ; a smile
a beautiful room
if it were built of books ''
the windows onto the terrace , lit the fire , translated the motto , Meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin
he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it

She whispered Steinhager to herself , several times , memorizing it
you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself ''
was always deep , with rough bass notes in it ; ; in reading , on platforms , even in the large auditorium of the Y.M.H.A. , Poetry Center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy
poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed
points the steps out with his flashlight : `` Its white stare filling her pale eyes To the blind brim with appetite , Bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs And sent us from the table in surprise To let the dishes soak all night , '' ( Mary Jane asked herself if Meredith was blushing at this line , or was it the fire
he read on
bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed , the lights go on : `` In dull domestic radiance I watch her staring face , still blind , Start wincing in obedience To dirty waters , counters , pots and pans , Waiting below stairs , in her mind ''

door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep ''
he whispered , several times , `` Eurydice ''
time rather urgently
her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment , she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited , expectant , and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth
west of the Sabine , but only God knew where
days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea
singed their eyelids an angry crimson ; ; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping ; ; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs
valley stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat , until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze
extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen
''
from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips
his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face

saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton
back to the wheel and stood there blowing , grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs
air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches
his throat and wet his lips
as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink ''
the dipper and drew water from a barrel
no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation
was warm and stale and had a brackish taste
was water
Lord , they still had water
his mouth with a small quantity
a long but carefully controlled draught
the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck
it grudgingly , her dark eyes baleful as they met his
and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face
the dipper on the edge of the deck , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully
happens when there's no more water ''
smolderingly
like charcoal , he thought -- dark , opaque , explosive
hair was the color and texture of charcoal
sparked like charcoal when it first lights up
the time , she had the heat of hatred in her , like charcoal that is burning on its under side , but not visibly
ran through the muscles of his jaws , but he kept control upon his voice
must be some water under there ''
his homely face toward the dry bed of the river

add fever to our troubles ''

do you want to see if I can stand fever , too ''
can boil it '' , he said
sharpened
lost and burning up already '' , she bit out tensely
tires are rattling on the wheels now
off in another day
no valley like this on your map
even know where we're headed ''
'' , he said as gently as he could , `` we're still headed west
we'll hit a trail ''

repeated
in time to make a cross and dig our graves ''
mouth compressed
way , he couldn't blame her
picked out this pathless trail , instead of the common one , in a moment of romantic fancy , to give them privacy on their honeymoon
been a mistake , but anything would have been a mistake , as it turned out
the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her
hated the whole idea before they started
she had hated him before she ever saw him
been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum , administered by her mother
of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound
jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder
left her inviolate , thinking familiarity would gentle her in time
mile westward , she had hated him the deeper

wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around ''

, they didn't sell you '' , he said miserably
knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina , but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own
it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them
or property , what would you have had at Baton Rouge ''
might have starved , but at least I wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt ''
under his heavy burn
eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead
puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze
lay clear , and open to the eye , right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead
noticed the clouds racing upon them -- heavy , ominous , leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills
never seen clouds like them before , but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina
hoarsely , `` Hang on ''
the oxen as he yelled
to turn them , putting the wagon against the storm
, he realized that in turning , he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground , instead of atop a grade or ridge
up over the wheel
had better get inside '' , he warned her
sat on in stubborn silence
bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel
they stared at it whirling down the valley , gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones
Conestoga began to whip and shake
turned black
filled with dust and wind and sound and violence
opened , pelting them with hail the size of walnuts
came the water -- not rain , but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket
water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods
splash of the rising waters , they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon , gnashing big chunks out of the banks
, frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff
current upon the prairie ceased , but the water stood and kept on rising
under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom
cut off abruptly
engulfed by the weird silence , broken only by the low , angry murmur of the river
darkness thinned , and there was light again , and then bright sunlight
fear and sound and wet and chill , they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills
level was higher than their hubs
heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored
no real sign of the river now , just a roiling , oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere
brush rode down the ribbon
then , the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past
crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine , hugging her shoulders and still trembling
was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben
compulsion to say something cheery , Ben Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit
, the wheels dug in
will put life back in the wagon , too ''
didn't give a sign she'd heard
watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current
riding the tree
closer and they could see a woman with white hair , sitting astride an upright branch
not call out
the tree passed , she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell
the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend
up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly
blob of the woman disappeared
the one who's lucky ''
murmured harshly
strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson
took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts , needing their comfort more than they needed his
nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon , half-swimming his way , for he was not a tall man
down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water
back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward
already swollen to bursting
their worldly belongings , next to the oxen and his gun , the seed grain had been the most treasured
spoiled now for seed , and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it
might as well enjoy it
the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished
lay muddy but placid , without a ripple of movement against the wheels ; ; there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding
if a man could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley
, numbing sense of futility swept over him
the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat
noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen
were tight again , the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece
within him
toward the front to give the news to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate
he felt better
wagon meant so much
a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee
the water off the sourdough and off the flour , salvaging the chunky , watery messes for biscuits of a sort
and jellies had not suffered
a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save
broke them open , hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie
nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java , but the fire was low , and he wanted to waste no time
the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open
thoughtfully at his wife's trunk , holding her meager treasures
hesitantly , `` Hettie , I don't figure your things got wet too much
good trunk
want to get them aired '' She said without turning her head , `` After that rain beating in atop the dust , there isn't a thing that won't be streaked ''
a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs
oil , and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of
a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze
roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames , the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep , not knowing what to do
were stuck fast
budge them
a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back
to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters
bad detonation shook Lifeboat No. 3 which trembled violently in the davits
: `` Come on , Sommers , Max step on it , we got a chance now
those ropes ; ; the boat's come unstuck ''
and swore and yanked and wept , scraping our hands until they bled profusely
was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare
was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water
Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat
get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his mop of bleached hair
tub is going to explode all at once ''
Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam , geysers of sparks and flames , and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke
we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno
leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water
, you bale while we row '' , Brassnose commanded
as I could determine , we were some 700 miles west of New Guinea , in the Bismark Archipelago
previously , we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance
peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific , for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon
gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands ; ; our muscles were hot wires of pain
strangely silent
man with the whitened hair murmured something : his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue , which I recognized , having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6 , class at the University of Chicago
said something which struck a chord in my memory
help us if we're near the island of Eromonga
in real trouble then
keep bailing -- or sink ''
puzzled by the remark , then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies
been speaking of this archipelago : `` Even when the islands were under German mandate before World War 1 , , Europeans gave Eromonga a wide berth
is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the Twentieth Century -- stone age amazons who live in an all-female , matriarchal society which is self-sufficient ''
, too , the jesting voice of a classmate , Bobby Pauson : `` But how do they reproduce , Dr. Griggs
that males have something to do with that process ''
been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly : `` I see your point , Pauson
, males play a role there , but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga
you wouldn't live long , for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes , or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods
, one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men ''
think I know what you mean , Brassnose '' , I said
know something about Eromonga
we come to a safer place ''
didn't
later , while we were bailing desperately , a dot of land came into view
Frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs : I recognized it as an ancient Manu gesture intended to propitiate the Devil
passed ; ; we had drifted closer
voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big bo'sun's mate quavered : `` Tchalo
Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff ''
at the looming shoreline
a wooden tower or derrick there , something like a ski jump ; ; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs
example of engineering in a primitive society
is the scaffolding for , Brassnose ''
a sound of despair deep in his throat
embarrassing to see strapping , blonde Brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen

their tultul , the ' jumping platform ' of death
the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose , to discover if a male is worthy of survival there
I heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when I was a small boy growing up in Rabaul
never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers ''
was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft
Brassnose -- as a man with a strain of Melanesian in his blood -- to speak to them
had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked
I mustered my few words of the Manu dialect and said , `` We greet you in peace

and I come from a ship which was destroyed by fire
thirsty and hungry ; ; our sore and burned hands and arms need attention ''
in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me
that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair
, `` My name is Songau and these girls are Ponkob and Piwen
welcome to Eromonga
await you on the shore
have food , water and rest ''
later , the outrigger grated on sand and other girls , waiting on shore , rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder
a dozen or so other outriggers moored there

rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight
a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick
been there for years ; ; others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them
one object which sickened yet fascinated me
also a corpse -- a male , judging from the coral arm bands , the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face , the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose
may have been two or three weeks' dead
with revulsion at the legs
shattered
bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh
must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul
divining my thoughts , the girl Songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an American woman might use in describing her rose garden : `` This is our tultul , a jumping platform , aku
you shall know it better
not well-made
one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago
thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one
very proud of it ''
have every right to be '' , I replied gravely in the Manu dialect , but my attention was fixed on Brassnose , the biggest and strongest of us
as if he was going to keel over
a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid
soon , anyway
the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne
your language too , for he is the grandson of a chieftain on Taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning
Frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather ''
the worst thing I could have said
a stricken face toward me and said brokenly , `` Sommers , you meddling Yank , you're a fool
males who brag of their strength ; ; they destroy such men with their damned tests
me , blast you ''
, I thought he was out of his head , talking wildly like this
glance at Songau and the other women confirmed what Brassnose had blurted out
faces had hardened after my statement
nod from Songau , four lithe and muscular girls darted to Frayne's side and seized him by the arms
was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle ; ; but four Eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived
terror had sapped some of Frayne's vitality and will
impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
Manu tongue , `` eromonga '' means manhood -- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed
hut to which I was assigned -- Max had his own quarters -- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases
was L'Turu and she told me many things
anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information
had a great dread of the island and felt I would never leave it alive , I eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women
account was later confirmed by the Scobee-Frazier Expedition from the University of Manitoba in 1951
L'Turu , I heard that until about 1850 the people of this island -- which was about the size of Guam or smaller -- had been of both sexes , and that the normal family life of Melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations
the middle of the last century an island woman named `` Karipo '' seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled
Karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes , after considerable loss of life on both sides
something of a politician as well as a militarist
exploited the exalted position she now occupied , by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death
decade or less , few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up
was great goddess , told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children '' , the crone told me
men went away from here
stayed had to pass tests
''
with mirth , showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth
women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here
I show you ''
woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood
shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling I saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground
guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized , then headed for home
beat up on his squaw ''
up and saw Ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib
out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack
like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles ''
thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver
moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened
Indian wasn't too much at fault , Ramey thought
was only doing the best he knew how , like any of us
he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at
see yourself spread out on the pavement , Benny ''
to his partner
mean dream ''
exactly
it ''
and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble
, just you , all the time -- sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent partner ''
but he thought to himself , I always see me too

saw someone lying in the dirt , Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind
would realize they were really things that only he himself could think
realization , sometimes , he saw himself as he looked down
seen him yet ''
, referring to the Indian
wasn't in the car '' , Ramey said
didn't go clear around '' , Benson said
you want to see something , he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car ''
long a waiting line '' , Ramey answered , pretending to joke
minutes later the insurance man , a road checker , drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state
a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed
just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed
drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges , the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane
an agent on the east end , wore the hat , trying to look like a tourist
always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head
man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town
with Ramey and Benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer
often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear
were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer
a body you won't mind looking at '' , Benson said and they stopped
driven up with her husband in a convertible with Eastern license plates , although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that
shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt
tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply
outfit does she drive for ''

caused a lurch in Ramey , a recognition
have been someone he had once loved
never seen her before , but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson went in and out of the cities , at each end of their run
routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay
you ever see her again
subsided , it was only a small yearning
was lonely
she doing in this bunch ''
, and Ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been
looked around at the countryside
swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing
only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on
to watch a blonde-haired man , also in shorts , standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly
caught his attention was obscured by the car itself , so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see , but Benson knew what it was
took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when Benson , in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could never decide was real , said , `` You don't want to go around there , Ma'am ''
stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her
stood near the bent levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car
drivers moved closer
does he want , a spoon ''
to Ramey
detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth , while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain
it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would always remember
were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top
twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside
men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man
tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red V at the neck , the sleeves pushed above the elbows
and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes
very tanned -- big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster
dead , isn't he ''
said
and bent over the body of the Indian
nothing in particular on the man's face
simply a matter of curiosity , a natural right to examine
this ''
said , backing up a step , still looking down
were mostly to himself
''
a gentle concern in Benson's voice
down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded , blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement
what is it ''
said with a tone of impatience
is it
had spoken only once
the words again inside , weakened , the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees , until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears
reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg
sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin
at the shining , shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees , `` Don't do that , fella
''
seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist
and caught the man just to the left of his mouth
a straight , solid , once-in-a-lifetime shot ; ; he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin
and the air expelled from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together
took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement
a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand
watched the man sit suddenly , a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was , really , to knock a man off his feet
done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard
thoughtful look , the man sat on the pavement , legs straight out in front of him
hung like empty shirt sleeves , and his mouth was slightly open
seemed several seconds , the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it
brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth
and pulled the hand away
there was no realization in his eyes
hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him
not look around
happened ''

hurt ''
voice said , and then he heard a sort of wail from the man's wife
on the ground began to move ; ; one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him
down the front of his sweater , soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder , as though the bright V woven into the neckline had melted , running a darker color
kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back
you hear , can you talk to me ''

, puzzled sound came from the red mouth
looked around quickly at several of the people
the crowd had stepped forward to help
saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment
did you do it -- why did you hit him ''
, her voice rising
nothing
in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again
feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers
seemed to know for sure what had happened , nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver , beyond finding out
around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman
his arms , gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly
a glimpse of the insurance man
the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey
over now , the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them
him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer
the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body , the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol
right , step back ''
said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis
straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him
all right ''
-- it's my mough '' , the man said , trying to talk without moving his lips
face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it
calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head -- caught in the wicker back of the chair , the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute
continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow
the door and listened as his servants ran up , alarmed at the sound of the shots
their chattering , and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes
only then that he turned to look at Penny
sitting on the edge of the bed again , back in the same position where the snake had found her
had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth
hands were calm , now
guts , thought Keith
more guts than any other woman in the world
'' , said Penny , `` Keith , you were wonderful
suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am
, Keith ''
at her sincerity
the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty

they'd been married
her mind pretty well , by now , its quick perceptions and sympathies , its painful insistence on truth and directness , its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate , even in part
beauty always surprised him anew
realize that this is hardly the time to say it , Penny '' , said Keith
knowing you , I know that you're glad to be alive , and grateful -- and sorry because I killed the snake , even though I had to
so ''
her eyes
'' , she said , almost in a whisper , as if admitting to a crime
snake was beautiful , wasn't it ''
, his voice getting harsher in spite of himself , as he struggled to control his growing anger
was a king cobra , the largest you ever saw , and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle , didn't it

did not answer
she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him
all God's creatures , aren't we ''
snarling now
of us -- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle
this village and these stinking brown people because they're God's creatures , too
love Ahmiri , that black bastard of a servant even a little more , because he's a beautiful man
loves you because you're a beautiful woman
God's creatures , aren't we , Penny
us , that is , except me
me , you hate my guts , because I like to hunt
hate me -- and we both know it -- because I killed that filthy snake
why don't you say something ''
not rise to his mood
isn't anything left to say , is there , Keith ''
let herself into the bed , and took her regular side , away from the door , where she slept better because Keith was between her and the invader
she was not sulking , not even angry at him
he knew that she had stopped loving him
has its headwaters in the tableland of the world , the towering white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet
brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal
had looked down on the Brahmaputra more times than he could remember , during the war days when he flew over the Hump of the world , thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space
looked down more than up
of the jungles below him , and of the wild , strange , untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return , on foot perhaps , to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted , and animals the lords
it had been just a romantic dream of his , the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war
after the war '' was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself
in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves
record of kills made him a man to listen to -- a man paradoxically , who might even survive
a fighter pilot after the stint over the Hump in the big crates
was Britain's weapon of attrition , and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war
how to shoot down Nazis
knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear
true , but only half the truth
half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself
the killing
England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity
killing
would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi
we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish
bombed Britain , so the RAF retaliated and shot them all down

a war of nerves , of stamina , of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the British on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis , who were better organized and technically superior
a long time before the British tipped the balance
too much about air combat , and air killing , to be risked
him ( over his protests -- not including his true reason for wanting to fly ) and put him in the Command offices
where he met Penny
aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American WAC , a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work , ( regardless of how important she might have thought she was ) in the Command offices , but that was all
him better , on her part
a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals
go for bull-like muscle , as a rule
strength in his six-foot frame , but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier
on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep
was black , already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom , the only one permitted to a man
little twittering WACS said he had the look of eagles -- and Penny , hating the cliche , had to admit that in this case it applied
an eagle
Keith had no romance
or hand-holding
met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly
offices were in the border country , up north , where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports , and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy
knew this , of course , and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers , they let a few drop every time they went over , hoping for a lucky hit
, they had been lucky
post was underground , and well camouflaged
hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps
a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling , but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer , if as efficacious , when a direct hit comes along
was actually more of a `` near miss ''
plunged into the ground near the Post , but not precisely into the Command room itself
a shattering , cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle , the air filled with dust and flying debris , and everyone in the room -- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks , as ordered
, everyone but Keith and Penny
there , just the two of them , in the rocking , shattering blast
on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more : Penny on her feet , proudly , because she cared too much
was a solitary one
damaged , but did not destroy the room
met Penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction
as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded , and mark the several killed , he climbed across the debris to Penny and took her hand in his
married them , on the next day
war , Penny had wanted Keith at least to visit her home with her
from Ohio , from what she called a `` small farm '' of two hundred acres , as indeed it was to farmer-type farmers
Keith's London-bred mind , such acreage sounded rather invincible
that , however , which decided them not to go to America
Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma
the wild beauty of the mountains , and the jungles
tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself
stop killing
his true love , not Penny
power of a gun , the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body , man or beast , was one he never wanted to lose
the hunting land , this hunger was considered to be a noble thing
got to Shillong , in Assam , he was happy
a paradise for hunters
the land of the sladang , the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread
black leopards
buck , the jungle stag that is even more noble than the Scottish elk
hunted elephant , although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African cousin
are big rogues in both countries
the ones Keith sought out -- the loners , the ones who killed for the joy of it , like himself
Penny would go out on tame elephants , raised from babyhood in the keddah
he was ever alert for game , and most particularly a tiger , Penny marvelled at the Eden they were traversing
upon cheetal deer at woodland pools
across their path , preening
fantastic flowers without perfume , and gaudy birds without song
played around the feet of the elephants , or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close
watched their progress with little pig eyes , and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the
the next morning , they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms , with the weighted line beside it ; ; and Robinson Roy , who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive , was already back on the surface
his safety man , Herr Schaffner , swam up to the boarding ladder together
courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first
heavily into the boat , sat down , and stripped off his triple-tank assembly
frowning
his mask from his forehead and threw it , unexpectedly , across the deck
, temper '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , laughing uneasily
blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten A.M. `` I loused it '' , Rob said , with a savage note in his voice
I have to do to set the record is to go on down
I come up ''
it my equipment ''
asked
it something went bad with the breathing ''
equipment was fine '' , Rob stated , standing up
a huge young man of twenty-four , clothed in muscle , immensely strong , with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation
stonily at the floor
was down to 275
that far half a dozen times
get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick ''
, I get it '' , Artie said , still on the ladder
are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record
also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself
turn around ''
, it wasn't that '' , Rob said
of awe came into his voice
I came up , damnit , I thought I was going down
up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening ''
'' , Artie said , and climbed in
right '' , Robinson said
was expecting it , sure
it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think
head back down again
, anyway
away ''
his voice under control again : no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him
the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat
was going to show how much he knew
boy didn't chicken out , no sir
into the rapture of the depths

the diver feel drunk ''
, that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh
not , if you're 200 feet under water '' , Artie said
'' , Waddell went on
nothing to fool with
kill you
I don't blame him for giving up the dive , much as I regret losing the story ''
giving anything up '' , Robinson said
there , towering over them all : gentle , mighty , determined , the moving force in the group ; ; and yet like a child among adults
think I got you and Artie and Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride
down again ''
my boy ''
exclaimed
not going to give up as easy as all that ''
a florid , puffy man in his early sixties , very natty in his yachting cap , striped jacket and white flannels
to Key West every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of `` Commodore '' was never used without irony
Forsythe , who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first
did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride
'' , he went on , `` when Rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip , I didn't think twice about it
him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop
I gave him the first decent job he ever had , six , seven -- how many years ago was it , Rob ''
years ago , Commodore '' , Rob said impassively
thinking , big deal : skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when I started
me '' , he said abruptly
down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters ; ; went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him
you gotta go , you gotta go '' , Mrs. Forsythe said
something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge
disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the German , who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley
there , Schaffner '' , he had said
I make you one ''
thank you very much '' , Schaffner had answered in his accented English
do not drink so much , thank you ''
looked the man over , trying to size him up
in his early forties , rather short and very compactly built , and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways
face seemed to promise a sort of innocence , until one looked into his eyes , which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence
heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika Corps , and he said to himself : I'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night
had said , making conversation : `` Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive ''
'' , Herr Schaffner had said
one hell of a decent boy
that kid ''
agree , yes ''
if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right ''
, no '' , Herr Schaffner said
to face him
''

that's what he told me
that's his main reason for making the dive ''
at him , altogether without guile , and shrugged his shoulders , making a little spreading gesture with his two hands
do you mean ''
, frowning
let me explain '' , the German said earnestly , his face still devoid of deceit
have in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year
wish to enter the American market , where the competition is very strong
have a powerful representative here , a firm with a national distribution and ten , twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products
respect to a fine young man , Mr. Roy is not able to provide these necessaries ''
not an eminently moral person , but he did not like what he had just heard
you tell him all this ''

not in so many words '' , the German said
surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy
never did I offer him the exclusive rights
of the need for advertising , and I agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity
most eager to make the dive ; ; of course , I was willing
was no definite agreement about business arrangements ''
, damn '' , Waddell said
the end of his front-page feature story , with byline
out the door
moment ''
said
intend to speak with Mr. Roy ''
else ''

you will pardon , I think it would be better if not
is determined to make this dive
tell him he will dive
this from my talks with him ''
, let's let him make up his own mind , OK ''

the basis of the facts ''
will make him unhappy and anxious '' , the German said
200 , 300 , 400 feet under the water , when he must be paying very much attention , he will be thinking about what you are telling him
not good , Mr. Waddell : you will do him great harm ''
no doubt that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said
back from the door and sat on a bunk
am an honest man '' , the German said with fervor
will give Mr. Roy his due for this dive
make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market
come to Florida
help him to get out of his little tackle shop

is no use causing him to worry at this time ''
words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty
a big swig of his drink
be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this
think maybe you're right , Schaffner '' , he said
has the distributorship for Florida , you say ''
'' , the German said
least for South Florida ''
God '' , Waddell said , `` we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times
you're right ''
his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps
was shaping up nicely in his mind : the young pioneer , as of old , altruistically braving the unknown ; ; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business America
me in another ''
asked
you '' , the German had said courteously
do not drink so much ''
in that same cabin , Robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk
relief mingled in his churning emotions
his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper
Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered
I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ; crossed himself ; ; said a Hail Mary , slowly and with understanding
his hands the cross that hung from his neck , he took his appeal direct to Headquarters
Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive
come off all right
set the record this time , and let me get back OK , so the German will give me the exclusive
my life different and better from this time on

himself again and rose
a good deal less shaky
reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found Artie , who came in and sat down on a bunk
picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger
awhile before he said , `` Roy , you know your decompression table , don't you ''
know I know it '' , Robinson answered warily
came straight up from 275 without a stop '' , Artie said
, I was a little bit confused
I wasn't down long enough to matter
see me stretched out on the deck , do you ''
know what they say about two deep dives in one day '' , Artie went on , still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently
don't think you should go down again ''
day Matsuo saw a marine
came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot , then fled without knowing the result , ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery
feet slowed , he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand
the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed
leafiest part of the tree , straddling a broad horizontal limb , he could see over the meadow
while he was content to let events develop in their good time
no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column , and while his shot had probably bred indecision , they would soon come hunting
had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure
; today ; ; tomorrow : no surrender
the self-dictate brought no peace -- only a faint chill of doubt
to himself , with firmness : `` No surrender ''
best to die fighting the marines
had also preached this , saying it was the way for eternal honor
the marines never came
were all dead
no rice
would be a choice between starvation and suicide
way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes
and leaned for a moment against the trunk
touched the bone handle of a knife
, an ammunition pouch , and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt
belt he wore a loin cloth
looked up from picking at a leg ulcer , he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing

came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed , as though debating whether to brave the sunlight
made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist
out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath
leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face

his rifle , easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness
his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills
fought from caves , and the marines resorted to burning them out
, like a ringing in his ears , he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows
of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo , his friend , and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance , then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet , his uniform blazing
let him advance
sank on his knees , they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy
faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses , both the burned and the unburned , the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun
marines had laughed at each other's retching , while stacking bodies
choked down his own nausea
he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle , reeking of death
peered to the left , to the right into the leafy , vine-crisscrossed maze
that the marines must be deploying around the meadow , with the one left to distract him
his hearing
stepping on leafmold ; ; faint creaking of belts and slings ; ; whispers : he heard none of these
hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird
couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there
occurred across the meadow : the lone marine took a seat on the ground ; ; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk , he embraced it
Matsuo tremble
comrades cocked the trap , that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver
at the man's face , Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge , and then he changed his mind
the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head
reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound

mischievous boy expecting punishment , Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle
to give his position away
did not retort
remained seated hugging the tree
the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy , and insects hummed and birds occasionally called
and grew anxious over the complete passiveness , concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke
so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight , immediately throwing his hands over his eyes
into a whirling dance , a sort of blind chasing of the tail
when he tumbled ; ; but jumping right up , he staggered in no particular direction
no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon
sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction , crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop
got closer to the tree , Matsuo noted the wild look on his face
of his jacket bulged

head was a poor target , so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk
spun , clapping a hand high on his chest , and dived forward
hush that followed the echoes , Matsuo was tense
come on him now without difficulty
reached a conclusion
was alone , for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree
tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage
was sprawled some thirty yards away , one arm extended
when the hidden arm flopped out

on the man , he made a rush
in the sunlight , pressed in like an invisible crowd
by the head , gently placing the rifle on the ground
snakestrike motion he grasped the hair , and , twisting , pulled the marine over on his back
bearded
had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone ; ; around the hole , blood glistened in a little patch
clutch on the hair , Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets
: a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding
other : a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief
one he tossed the objects aside
smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter ; ; he had no use any longer for exact time , even had the watch been running
was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief
the marine had no water
holder he took his own canteen
was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure
eyes opened , squeezed shut , then opened squinted in the glare
alive
the bottle to his own lips
reached up a hand
his head
for you ''
blinked , soon dropping his hand
had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on
came well equipped to die ''
made him lean over the man
and recognized it

had been his difficulty
sake , he must have wandered off from his bivouac
tried to roll on his right side , and moaned
rolled on the left side , propping on his left elbow , Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over
a good turtle ''
one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle
of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts
caves , with other supplies , they had kept cases of sake
shut his eyes
you a thrower of flame , marine ''
the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground , out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows
in his squat , gripping the hair
often he turned the knife
was dazzling in the intense sunlight
was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping
were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film
had thrown the left hand over his eyes
again he murmured something that ended in a giggle
have saturated himself in the drink , for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze
his head

he reached for the knife
bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it
barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes
yelled and flung the hand away
firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek
yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist
free and burned the hands into retreat ; ; burned the other cheek ; ; burned each hand when they came groping again
commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment
up
small measure of payment , marine ''
the knife in its scabbard , hung the rifle behind a shoulder
, hands on cheeks , rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach
weeping
toward his tree , once glancing back
was still
soon die
climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk , a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow

jungle , birds were mute , while insects preserved only the monotony of living

the marine : head lifted , he strained and called
astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat
his mouth and yelled
the rifle off his shoulder
for all he'd finish this marine who would not die
, but listened
as if the man were calling him : `` Hey , Japanese hey there , Japanese ''
tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container
the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct
''

nodded vigorously
, slung the rifle
was a winehead
had said that all marines were depraved
slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol
own thirst , Matsuo took out his water bottle
was all he would have ; ; he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline
of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline
to uncap the bottle , the rusty cap squealing on its threads
, the marine waved both hands and shouted
it was water he really craved ; ; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out
shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack
his head
no water for an enemy
this was gone , he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool
the bottle and replaced it
, he had less reason to desire it than the marine
longer the marine quieted down
slumped
part of his packet had stained dark

nothing for you '' , Matsuo said
superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion , besides the dishonor of it
for you ''
convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping
Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China
it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding
back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar
Throat and his gang stayed where they were
was slumped with his back against the bar , elbows supporting his massive frame
at the stranger as the distance between them closed
when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys ''

to me I don't remember altering any law about that ''
up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer
right here where you are , kid '' , he called
don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking '' : The stranger ignored him
stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver
Billy Tilghman '' , said the stranger , `` and I've come for Pat Conyers' body ''
what makes you think you're going to get it , pretty boy ''
I'm asking
the time I get what I ask for ''
winked at his six cronies
kid has no manners , boys
teach him some ''
was half drawn when he asked the question , but the weapon never left its holster
fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin
snapped round and he reeled back , crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling
on to him , dragged him upright and hit him again , this time sending him careening against the bar
gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting
himself aside , dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun
roared twice and two men dropped , writhing
shot doused the light
the far end of the room a voice yelled , `` You all right , Billy ''
, George , but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet
aim to have it ''
again , and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed
off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor
, Tilghman , I'm quitting ''
me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman
a light
his partner , George Rust , herded the men into a corner
now '' , said Tilghman with deadly calm , `` I'll repeat what I said
for Pat Conyers' body ''
minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial
, nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride , rode out of town with the survivors of the fight
critter will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George Rust , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him
won't stand for this
up the town ''
was correct
James Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot Hill in the township of Petrie , when shots were heard in the distance
'' , said the Reverend Doran , grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone , `` and now my brethren , it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere ''
and his comrades rode off to the battle
, who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months , certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship
essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it
in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street
length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn
riding down the street to demand Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire
citizens of Petrie had gathered inside Kaster's Store , halfway down the street
firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived
up the situation and shook his head
Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped up in here for days '' , he said
only one thing to move him fast , and we have it right here in this very store ''
the store owner and together they went into the stockroom
with six sticks of dynamite
gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap '' , he announced , `` and I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near enough to toss 'em through the window ''
outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways
men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed
away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back
couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang
had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks , run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through
did just that
the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters , with every outlaw either dead or injured inside
the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie
slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts
the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising , smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old , and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet
the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders
the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book
the most action , beat up more badmen with his bare fists , broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U.S. marshal who lived before or after him
years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West
of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship , but because Billy Tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career , his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the West have remained almost unsung
the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway , but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century
within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma in the 1890's
Bill Doolin , these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks , making liberal use of their guns
ambition , it appeared , was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of Jesse James and Billy the Kid , and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would stop him
that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the Doolin gang
rustled cattle from the outlaw , kept him supplied with guns and ammunition , harbored his men in their houses
to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers , named Ed Dunn , who lived at Rock Fort
bitterly cold day in January , 1895 , accompanied only by Neal Brown as his deputy , Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort and Dunn's ranch
snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside
evidence of occupation came from the chimney , which was belching out thick smoke
lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door
here , Neal '' , said Tilghman
I don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse ''
rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it
no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside
the door was a roaring log fire , a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day
it with his back to the door was the rancher , Ed Dunn
, Ed '' , said Tilghman
grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move
the door behind him and walked towards the fire
saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck
side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain
wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles , all trained on Billy Tilghman
marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide
, Tilghman never hesitated for one instant
right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him
behind them were Bill Doolin and five of his gang -- every man a killer
day '' , said Tilghman , placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire
dropped in to ask where Jed Hawkins lives
to locate landmarks in this snow ''
was trembling
look Tilghman in the face
the river for five miles '' , he said hoarsely
homestead is on the south bank ''
overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes
time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body
move on his part and he would be a dead man
'' , he announced , `` Guess I'll be going now , Ed , and thanks for the warmup ''
back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him
the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been allowed to come out alive
knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon
showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly
climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown
say or do anything '' , he said softly
get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry
is crawling with Bill Doolin and his gang ''
he spoke those words Billy Tilghman's life hung on a thread
the house a hoodlum named Red Buck , sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed , jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then
stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle
Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back
him go ''
fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell , Oklahoma , where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets
, a self-styled prohibition officer , had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since
he reeled out of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver
months now , Jack Carter , a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy , pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them , had been haunted by a dream , a vision , of a Woman
had no distinct shape or size and no particular face , but she radiated warmth , a sweet warmth ; ; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately
would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach
would run to the toilet behind the house
did this three or four times a day , for this Woman was almost always with him
feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him
never said anything , so he figured it was all right
when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure
not keep his eyes off her when at school ; ; when he went home at night , he took her with him in his mind , and she did the things the anonymous Woman used to do , and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do
awoke in the mornings , she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh
( her first name was Evelyn ) was an attractive girl
blonde , blue-eyes , fair , buxom without being heavy , she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh , starched summer dress
beginning to stir and come alive in her , too ( it may have been there for a good while , since she was twenty now ; ; but if it had been , it had been smothered until now by fear ) : you could tell it by the way she watched the older , bigger boys , like Jack
look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick
in August , the hottest part of the year , and for the first few days Miss Langford was very lenient with the children , letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another
two or three days they went home early
that is , except Jack
around the schoolhouse , watching through a window from outside while Miss Langford straightened desks and put the room in order
this was on the third day of school ) she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress -- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg
for a moment his heart had stopped beating
time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him
back , ducked and ran , crouching , down the hill away from the school
look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath ; ; then he slowed to a walk
became even stronger now
get her yet '' , he muttered to himself
got to get her ''
he dreamed a dream violent with passion , in which he and the Woman , now the teacher , did everything except engage in the act ( and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality ) , and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire
litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily
the matter , honey ''
, with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child
you hungry ''
, I'm not hungry '' , he said , pushing back the bacon and eggs
was already hot at 7:30 A.M. , and it was getting hot in the kitchen
a little sick at his stomach
you sick ''
'' , he said
be all right
it's this hot weather ''
you play hard today then
you get sick , ask the teacher to let you come home early
the car for me , and I'm going to town this afternoon ''
, I won't play hard '' , he promised
Charles Lever yelled , `` Hey , Jack '' , from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house , and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door , yelling `` Good-bye , Mom '' over his shoulder
say , boy ''
, grinning , showing his huge yellow teeth
also fifteen , was tall and skinny , scraggly , with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes
himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him
know what I done last night ''
as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school
of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty , because girls were Charles' only apparent interest
always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now


got Margaret Rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry ''
imaginary picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind
beat faster
you say ''
, lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with Charles
you do it ''
, I jist got on top of -- '' `` No , I mean how'd you get her to do it ''
, I jist ask her ''
like that ''
, yes
hangin' around me a lot here lately , and I figgered I might as well's try it
heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it ''
never heard that ''
all over Branchville
get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself ''
might try it one of these days '' , Jack said wonderingly , thinking of Miss Langford
reached the school , a gang of boys and girls were already there playing `` crack the whip '' in front of the schoolhouse
, in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside
for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand
go inside ''
, come on Miss Langford , play with us just onct '' , one of the little girls begged , smiling wistfully
, not now '' , said the teacher
at dinner time
now ''
grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse
Miss Langford all morning
think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles had said that morning about Margaret Rider
would look across the aisle at Margaret , fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress , sitting in the sixth-grade row , and he could hardly believe she would do what Charles had said she did
, remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids , Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys , except Charles , went off out the road to play ball
ain't you playin' ball ''
Charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade , watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse
Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called
druther stay here and watch the girls '' , Charles grinned
some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress ''
'' , Jack said idly , watching for Miss Langford
came out of the schoolhouse
appeared , two or three of the little girls jumped up and down , yelling , `` Goody , goody ''
play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants
'' Charles rose also , and the two of them moved over to join the girls
crack the whip a few minutes without mishap
Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls , Jack , in the middle of the line , gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards , sitting down hard , her dress flying over her head
was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again , Jack ran over , offered her his hand and said , `` Gosh , I'm sorry , Miss Langford
mean to pull so hard ''
all right '' , she said , tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes
was my fault ''
hand she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with the other
hand touched his , fire went through Jack and he felt weak , but he managed somehow to get her on her feet
she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go
you '' , she said , dusting herself off
you play with us again , Miss Langford ''
the little girls said
more today
other day ''
, shucks '' , the girl said
don't believe I'll play any more neither ''
neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone
off alone out the road in the searing midday sun , past Robert Allen's three-room , tarpapered house , toward the field where the other boys were playing ball , thinking of what he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after school -- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes
came back to the schoolhouse , his mind was made up
would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class
do it , he thought , because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work
considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school
drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work , too , and the teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack
I've got to take a chance on it '' , he told himself desperately
surprise his plan worked perfectly
right , if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school is out '' , Miss Langford said firmly , not smiling
will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems ''
when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home
saw them
was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think , his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child , `` How will I do it
fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise
little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck
with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman
muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family
white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : `` Look at your watch , Col. Garvier
almost time for and calinda to begin ''
Garvier was one of New Orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners
and gave the signal for the dance to start
ran gaily to the center of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny No-Name
pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum
his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy
flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds
was of Haitian origin
girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows
possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners
wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South's oldest and most cherished names
a pace-setter in high society
a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses
Orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad -- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on American soil
gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders
, handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by the other slaves
gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race
had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St. John
actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses
slave was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near
eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection
is your name , boy
bit closer
bite , you know ''
at Madame Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her
smiled shyly
name is Dandy Brandon , missy
to Master Alexander Prieur ''
with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms
quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy ''
impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage
skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm
seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor
the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees
last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that Dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver
the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows

you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase
in gold in this chamois sack
old fool argues about the price , tell him I shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer
gout and depends on Louis' pills and bleedings
he owns 300 slaves
shouldn't matter to him ''
, the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native Sierra Leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat
eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner
youth , Madame ''
said softly
one is a tender chicken , oui
beauty , such fine flesh
rip and shred easily for Madame ''
quiet , Devol
forgetting your place ''
coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur
took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy Brandon -- cowering in the back seat of the carriage -- to her mansion at 677 Perdido Street
Lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion
curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle
a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head
wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses
about 50 years old
young man , my dear
you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself '' , he said , frowning with displeasure
her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster
is to be our house guest , Louis
the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways
a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation ''
so , my dear
will be ready shortly ''
led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave
been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life
liked the smell of Delphine's perfume
her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth
he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony
Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home
dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St. John
exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when Madame Lalaurie -- after closing the door -- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber
just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell
finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket
weeks after Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited
orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and Delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from Paris , and Louisiana politics
was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase
Dandy Brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him
once superb body was a mass of scars and welts
face showed the ravages of malnutrition
pointed an accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted : `` Evil woman
this you like to hurt to beat people I want to go home ''
the last words he ever uttered
he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore
Lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead
broke up in confusion
with horror at Madame Lalaurie and made speedy departures
like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse
the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story
saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry for him
our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest
paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night
returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I cannot say
and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs ''
at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : `` That poor boy
have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced
have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die
pitiful end ''
slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel , Dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded
were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady
runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in New Orleans' dives
verdict was `` death at the hands of a person or persons unknown '' , and the elite of the city , accepting Delphine's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold
life went its serene way -- soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners
over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital
on July 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip
Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight
Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion
was not more than 16
nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back
girl was tiring fast ; ; the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street
cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : `` Help me , somebody
pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw
'' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me ''
, and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper
ain't nothin' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace '' , Feathertop would say
accommodations may not be the poshest , but man
nobody askin' for your ticket stub , neither ''
been conning the freights for a long , long time now
the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child
all that
been a very long time that had no form and no end
-- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out
out and never to return again
day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped
the day it ended
car was cold , early in the morning
pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina
his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly
slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ; at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot
lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor
her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop's music pfffted away
that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner
thing , but the right twist for the action that counted
that was the word , hot
a morning-frightened sparrow's wings , with the sun shining down over them
, yet
for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however

boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting
less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight
, high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished
made it , Cappy '' , the chick said
, seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close
''
, standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants
of that
a respectable house here ''
and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall
big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes
the black plastic kazoo lightly
sit '' , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him
crap is softer over here ''
smiled , and started forward
yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm
stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably
vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do
know this guy ''
, square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up
was strictly from Outsville

is with this vow jazz ''
, lounging against the freight's vibrating wall
-- we eloped '' , Cappy said
came up and he said it defiantly
, congratulations ''
an elaborate motion with his hand
were going to be easy pickins
have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much
, the chick had a little something the others didn't have
gonna be fun collecting
just yet
a connoisseur
to savor his meat before he tasted it
sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings
just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith ''
at them wolfishly
ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused
you know -- you're right ''
a finger at him
, come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided
okay
nice guy ''
to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her
the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle
his throat ; ; it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance
it all doped , of course
kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll
diddle
you come from , Mr. -- uh -- Mr. Smith ''
politely
from ''


riding train for a ways now ''
into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself
while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey ''
the matter , she wanna go the bathroom ''
it immensely funny
scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked

, I mean , no that isn't what I said ''
at him
only said I was hungry
had anything to eat all day ''
Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles
ya say so , fellow travelers
we got dinner right here
buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two ''
wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar
and opened the carpet bag
out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it
the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot
charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier
it '' , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper
, but what're we gonna eat

'' , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my ever-lovin' patience ''
once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners
dogs , man
greatest , but they stick to your belly insides ''
down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil
they began to sizzle
up and grinned
Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained
self-served ''
had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette
, Ernie thought , too bad
come you're riding the rods , kids like you ''

down at his wide hands , and did not reply
, Kitty's face came up and she said , `` My father
want us to get married
ran away ''
didn't he want you to get hitched ''
even she did not answer
down at her hands , too
few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy
my fault ''
came around sharply
fault , hell
all my fault
been careful it never woulda '' -- he stopped abruptly
went up
the matter ''
still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant ''
at himself
he was stupid , her old man
heard nothin' like it : Kitty's gonna go have an abortion , and Kitty's gonna go away to a convent , and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin' , y'know ''

a slightly different matter
Midge , and the child
had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about
before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out
kids weren't like him

, Pull out of it , old son
just another couple of characters to roll
got , you get
all this other
drink ''
, taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket

you offer ''
came from the open door of the boxcar
man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade
at the man
big
, with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly
, Ernie thought
gonna give me a drink , fella ''
man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar
a moment
could break him in half
'' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips
down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder
stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring
the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely
his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously
again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door
, now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket
didn't know I was gonna have company in this car ''
going to Philadelphia '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more
, I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie
suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it
you and me will , girlie , but these two ain't goin' nowhere ''
on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car
screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me
stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth
split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard
hit the bigger man with an audible thwump
him backward in a footballer's tackle
down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs
showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back
went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` Aaawww ''
were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade
the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud
came out with a snick
the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat
insanely and her face was white
at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked , `` Help him

''
liked nor disliked the Old Man
he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after Mass , and at noon , and at six each evening -- its tone , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom of the streets
Man was unimportant
he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; ; or the smell of thick tomato paste -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour -- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth
surging whirling sounds of bats at night , when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights
bay of female dogs in heat
called him by name , although he had one
, that's what he was called in the old country ; ; but here he was just Signore or the Old Man
was not unusual , because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders
when commanded
to church on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession
asked nothing of its parents -- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing
thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened
past was dead here as the present was dead
Old Man had had a wife
she , too , ignored him
tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders , she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop
hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase
she strutted down the street , the Old Man would have been blind not to have noticed both
at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars , rode away in it , and never came back
she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said
, no
one
she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino ''
, Torino
herself fancy airs
she had a part on the stage in the old country , she thought she could carry her head higher than ours ''
slapped their thighs
not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good ''
''
, caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted , never to be tweezed away
that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled , but had condemned again and again
''
the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig
enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed -- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance , as thin as the seams on her stockings , and still thinner
had not commanded her to stop
not questioned why
said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell ; ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him
was never without that dog
his eyes -- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow -- had not altered their expression or direction
Man's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he wouldn't have had anyone know it
had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife
he called for his withered , wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar
to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him
he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town in Italy , not the outskirts of Philadelphia
have been Bari or Chieti for the way it smelled
it matter to him that the park at the foot of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals
the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the Schuylkill
was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness
they were one and the same
the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city
the streets with two-story houses the color of ash
the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches
with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors
stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it
coffee shop on Drexel Street , where the men spent their evenings and Sundays playing cards , had a rose hedge beneath its window
reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it
house on the street had no lawn before it
low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade
Bartoli's shop
, from a second-story showroom , wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood
Old Man remember them there
else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks -- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery
alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences , where one man's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy
hatred and fear were one here , shaded only by fig trees and grape vines
forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch
Man silently fed upon these streets
him alive , waiting
what and for whom , only he could tell and would not
as though he had made a pact with the devil himself , but it was not yet time to pay the price
holding out for something
determined to hold out
Man's son threw himself down , belly first , upon a concrete step , taking in the coolness of it , and dreaming of the day he would be rich
he didn't care that he had no mother , that he couldn't remember her face or her touch ; ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose provided for him
named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he couldn't have cared less about that either
life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep
would be a man , he would be a rich man
not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park
not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning
not carry a brief case
he work at all
square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step
sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running , bowing with her running , calling out in her bowing , `` At your service ''
order her to bring coffee , and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff -- he would not remove his gloves -- and light and smoke
do that when he would be a man
, Laura ''
to his sister on the porch above the steps
only ten months older than he
, what would you say if I smoked a pipe ''
not answer him
unconcerned against the broken porch fence , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair in the sun
leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales
foot , whose arch swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes -- toes like fingers , whose tips glowed white
while she sat there , her sinewy arms swirled before her chest
showed no sign of having heard Pompeii
a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours
, blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality
the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance
never sure they fully took him in
again , `` Laura ''
only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it
in a mood '' , he thought `` There's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood ''
what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about
for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him
Laura
was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him
tongue , an aged yellow eye , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin , stared unfalteringly at him
sake , goat , git ''
goat would not
boiling milk , ain't you ''
with his hand , knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch
over
undulated gradually , covering space , to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats
mouth opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light , earthy taste of it
fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did
slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud
was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane
boy could see only the goat's belly
Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it
it was there , knew also what it was about , but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back
be time enough , perhaps the Old Man reassured himself , to pay the devil his due
to give up his soul
meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii's shaved hair , edged up close to him
they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew , so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks
at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta's idiot brother
Romeo's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground
Concetta's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy , and her shrill , impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything
in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it
filled with smoke , and Maggie's head throbbed with excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to quench it
rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery
months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head
flying into rages and started digesting her food ; ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her
so heavy that Maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her
seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; ; there was the daily round of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating
a great deal to do with it ; ; Stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office , taking what salary his father could hand out to him
would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap
Stuart pored over figures every night , trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more
Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon : `` Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ''
seems to me you have enough to do as it is '' , Eugenia said
been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again
have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something '' , Maggie said
would make me feel a lot better , but the Woman's Exchange isn't taking baked goods any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery ''
should think so '' , Eugenia said
one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day ''
so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice ''

up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck
be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed '' , Eugenia said
Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old ''
Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best's Liliputian Bazaar in New York , and I'm sick and tired of hearing about Evadna Mae Evans ''
now , Maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , Eugenia said
just thinking of a way for you to be sensible ''
sorry
seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think of a way to make a little extra money ''
, let's see
a list of your assets ''
laughing , and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop , and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining
came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures
have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers '' , Eugenia said
could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it's nice and sunny , but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that ''
else ''
might set up a dress shop in the living room ''
woman in the block has tried that ''
about a tea room , then
set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes ''
too elaborate
isn't strong enough to take on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I ''

, `` Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you don't like any of those I can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough ''
, I'm sure I could do that '' , Maggie said
it really wouldn't be fair , taking your jobs away from you ''
worry , I can get plenty more '' , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could
looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there , and be brushing up on her typing so Eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it
then whenever I have a minute I can be working at it , and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time
can go back to my contests and be thinking while I'm doing the washing ''
are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything ''

, `` Oh Eugenia , I wish '' `` What ''
wish I had three wishes '' , Maggie said
of them for you ''
bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people
dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days
settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources
huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies
facilities to take care of them ; ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities
of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates
was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay
offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything
people talked and argued ; ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done
to be done ; ; it was the theme song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government
to be done
said it to each other a dozen times a day
to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once , twice , fifty times a day
the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster
furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold
in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up , under doors , around loosened window frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof
had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric heater in Grandma's room
so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive
burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms
mainly in the kitchen ; ; they moved Maggie's bed and the baby's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds
it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to
said a mouthful '' , Eugenia said grimly
being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin
to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever
of people are poor all their lives ''
of people haven't our brains and talent ''
know you when you start talking about brains and talent '' , Maggie said
working up to something , and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression ''
only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it '' , Eugenia said
Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way
want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater
hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope's room , and the two of them dragged it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire
that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it
her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give in
of her to use it up

the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips : `` Under the window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together
but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder ''
his lie
God's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it
died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it
case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own
simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing
told God , Frank '' , he said
lacerate the -- congregation ''
an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash
his beloved son could rest in peace

Mr. Whipsnade Oscar , and Dr. Dunne P.GA , and C'un Major Frank

hadn't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr. Robards
it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in -- spiritual ways
-- far more irritating than his manner of speaking , which he made only token effort to change -- was his devotion to that old horse of Tolley's
, rather
Robards' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes
her `` the Mare '' much as Mrs. Whipsnade spoke of `` the Queen , God bless her ''
with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of `` the Mare '' , `` the Racin' Mare '' , the revolting Gunny
first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall
had happened
tried to bite her
Mr. Robards said , just a nip anyway
back , Miss Jen , she's oneasy of your scarf ''
`` Quit that , you sor'l devil ''
for his wife's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January
annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too
hours to his laments that the war and `` Mist Fair's '' poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it
so much that was unpleasant -- Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach
was no novelty to Mr. Robards
a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested
to having Dr. Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her
were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure
be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian
night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house
the dear baby came , he had Tillie over here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been
now that she had had Dr. Dunne , feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets
something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted , saying , `` You don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day , Miss Jen , hon
up cute -- Arcilla , Flotilla '' Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and -- `` Kezziah , for Miss Kizzie '' , he suggested
was mighty good to you past times , an' this'll fetch her ''
must be thinking of a boy-name , something special
till she saw the Mare's foal
in all Kentucky
, up on his legs when he was an hour old
Royal Robards
don't you name him Jesus Christ
burst into tears
deeply distressed
no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been
she wasn't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it
a good idea why not
`` At Home '' cards she sent out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , hadn't brought many callers in two whole months
and Miss Sis had come
Miss Shawnee Rakestraw , full of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly Rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather , was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer
an idea
had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round
she'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips
Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz couldn't have been very cordial , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there
more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie's and Nick's -- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies
was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too
him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs. Robards and the children
they were well
tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit
ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame
a party an' leave 'em out , hon '' , he suggested
swell party , send an invite to ever'body but them -- those folks you met at the Galt House , the ones I've got to know in this new Jockey Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood
oystchers -- couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time
word gets round ''
you dare
Jen was funny that way , funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and perk up
downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try
surprised when Roy's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town
-- he did have a nice smile -- took off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he'd give her a lift to Quinzaine
was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on
for yourself , Miss Zion
take a minute ''
in through his own wide gateway
the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome
the sight of a friendly face
won't care your comin' , will she ''
of course not '' , Zion said uncomfortably
must have forgiven me '' , Henrietta murmured to the room
of Doaty's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; ; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman
herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin
had guessed already and kept her counsel
, It's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us
been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable
the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted
would have been quite circumspect without Hetty's flair for drama , especially through the long summers
, in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; ; there had been the dancing class -- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three
been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved
died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles
safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was spared this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles' hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know
vulnerable ; ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her
would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta
always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice
this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty's bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her
would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice
on her side , finding the idea oppressive
had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him
imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone
, no sin
, no virtue
thought to end a curious night
were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf
else , she would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden
wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards
her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls
always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray
sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window
below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness
, she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it
thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song
so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age
neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs
unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human
toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot
the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly
came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws
her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty
in the dew '' , said Rosa coldly
change your shoes before you turn around ''
so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home
, eager for whatever lay beyond the door
Blackwell , there was only one church
slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea
first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity
and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child
some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested
man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches
impulse , she turned back and said good morning
his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time
offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic
been slow to come '' , he said
my dryin' out time ''
at her flowers
taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality
be takin' me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so soon's they plan
of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin
myself out that does it ''
her with rising hope
like to hear how I go about it ''
nice of you '' , Henrietta said doubtfully
welcome ''
himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots
ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text
month , f'r three days '' , he said happily , `` I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever
the tissues ''
that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense
the tissues '' , he said , `` and pacifies the system
did it , and he lived to a great age ''
up at her sharply
remember , do you ''
suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away
the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years -- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible
never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea
be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses
gently , `` Of course I remember you ''
so well's I remember you '' , he said
the young Blackwell woman
on a black night with a lawful wedded man
all about you ''
do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed
blame a man for leavin' his wife '' , he said quite cheerfully
mine many a time , only she never knew it
a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit
in that ''
'' , said Henrietta dryly
a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly
be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws
this old man's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter's open censure
she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned
come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow
to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress
vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man
not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad ''
dam' porridge is no breakfast '' , he said
and sops ''
the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones
lowly today '' , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up
got this idea about drying out '' `` It ain't an idea ''
it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water ''
piously to heaven and said , `` Beer don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence
sighed

''

( she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own
rest her soul , she was a sweet one
now ''
a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old
at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength
a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man
down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her
edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep
covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry
was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky
mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty
and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` Dorothy Tredding '' seemed suddenly impossible
down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss
sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty's flowers
, rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery
, suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts
family had come from Miyagi Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain
were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the Japanese came from Southern Asia
were of Caucasian blood
white skins and blue eyes ; ; all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful
few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians
them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South
was one of these fortunate occasions
taller than most Japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall
was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong
, soft and full , was something for any man to dream about
black eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody

an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted
be better than the land of her ancestors
nothing wrong with her job
been assigned to the psychopathic ward
no depressingly serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor -- sometimes the Navy sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage -- but mental health as a rule was very high
the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that Japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore , because the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours
interested in psychiatry , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients
suffered in her off-duty hours
now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the Officers' Club , having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime
changed into a cocktail dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck
one of the Navy's crossroads -- you find them all around the world
the West Coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the Seventh Fleet , and Yokosuka was the Seventh Fleet's principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty
later , all the gray Navy ships came in here ; ; if Tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San Diego and Long Beach
wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there
, rather than saw , the approach of the good-looking young man
through from the Fleet Bar , which was stag , with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried
saw Tommy sitting alone , the tinkling sound stopped
perhaps a trifle tipsy , having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out of practice ; ; he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in Hong Kong , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant
one of the carriers -- an aviator
a fifty-fifty chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different
something to a man -- and it wasn't just Japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas
as if foreign duty implied and excused license ; ; it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not
young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different
, girl-san ''
, turning on what was meant to be charm
catchee boy-furiendo
likee date with me ''
beg your pardon ''
out of her cold rage
don't believe I know you , and I can't understand your quaint brand of English -- it was meant to be English , wasn't it ''
young officer fell back on his heels , open-mouthed and blushing
, he had the decency to blush , she thought
-- I'm sorry
, I thought -- I mean I really had no idea '' -- `` Oh , yes -- you had ideas ''
furiously
wrong ones ''
jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy slang
off , fly-boy ''
-- sorry ''
, and took off , obviously feeling like a fool
was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy
like a fool , too
been this way in college , or in nurses' training ; ; it wasn't this way in the hospital at San Diego
accepted her for what she was -- a very charming girl
addressed her in broken English at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she wasn't American
Spanish girls who look like Tommy Momoyama , brunettes with a Moorish hint of the Orient in their faces ; ; there are beauties from the Balkan states who are similarly endowed , and -- back in the blessed United States -- they were regarded simply as pretty women
having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , Tommy was being humiliated at every turn
around , self-consciously
Japanese waitresses were murdering the English language at the counter -- Yuki Kobayashi happened to be one of them
Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called , `` Bifutek-san ''
steak sandwich , or `` Kohi Futotsu ''
cup of coffee
Japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well groomed
with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander ; ; the other was with her American husband and their exceptionally appealing children
did nothing for Tommy's mood
herself rebelliously , and with pride , I am an American
she was , and would remain
was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the Club , there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken English
been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good Japanese
know ; ; after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English
was becoming increasingly sure
been sent to the wrong place for duty
more to service in the Navy Nurse Corps than the hours in the ward
to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours
was raucous male singing from the Fleet Bar
terribly off key , and poorly done , and Tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt lonesome and put-upon
her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check ; ; she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated
angry had given her a slight indigestion
her living quarters at the hospital she took bicarbonate of soda , and sulked
after a while , she went to her mirror
all true
looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men
still , they did not have to be so crude in their approach
a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful
that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of Oyajima -- which was not very far from Yokosuka
she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown
of course , had never heard of a kotowaza , or Japanese proverb , which says , `` Tanin yori miuchi '' , and is literally translated as `` Relatives are better than strangers ''
this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water
scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report
beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual , too , and Walt Perry was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing
anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know
opinion , Doc had not grown up
was not entirely wrong in the belief
never been a good reason for Doc Doolittle to grow up
come into the Navy too young , with the image of the fun-loving Guns Appleby before him
found him much too early , and its perils -- and especially its awful boredom -- were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical jokes , and even now Doc had never found any stabilizing , sobering influence
young at heart , with an overdeveloped sense of humor
about the captain's indoctrination of new men , took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches with ethyl chloride , and gave no thought for tomorrow
doing thirty years , and the Navy would take care of him
security enjoyed by Doc Doolittle , and nearly all members of the Armed Forces , is a wonderful thing
all a man in uniform has to do is to get by
not rise to the heights , but he can get by , and eventually be retired
been under restriction to the ship since the Bustard left Subic
him of liberty in Hong Kong , but he told Boats McCafferty that Hong Kong was a book he had read before , and the Navy would always bring him there again , some day
he was restricted to the confines of the Base because Walt Perry , being thoughtful , knew that Doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the Supply Base
Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well
two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the Naval Base , and visit an old shipmate

a smart salute at the gangway , went up the dock , and turned down the wide street in front of the Petty Officers' Club
he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time
some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk
was exercise , boating and hiking , which was not only good for you but also made you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted
, with a fashionable companion -- but he'd lost his clubs , hadn't played in years
swimming over at the Riverside Hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog
packing trip into the Sierras , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark
, he thought , take a long walk -- but where
rang
missed it '' , Buzz's voice said , `` You should have gone over to the Pagan Room with us

but scrumptious , and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian band ''
, Buzz '' , Owen said
went over to the Willows and dropped two notes ''
'' , Buzz said , `` Listen , we're having a stag dinner over at the Pagan Room on Friday
stag dinner with Toodle Williams ''
and laughed
to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to Reno for stag dinners
'' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen ''
a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest
was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door
'' , Owen called out
''
Mrs. Gertrude Parker '' , a soft voice explained , `` And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes , please ''
he thought , a lush divorcee at last
me in the lobby
disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door
at his green pajamas with the yellow moons
do you do ''
, semi-professionally
church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in Alaska
them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light
there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them ''
''
see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light , `` you and I can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo ''
is that ''
wasn't satisfied with his reaction
Owen thought , smug and sappy
a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye
her a lewd , winking effect
you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo ''
, winking wildly
are a very difficult group of people ''
don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do ''
in a sickly-tolerant fashion
know , that's very interesting
know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that
canvassing I do , the more I note how far most people are from their personal God ''
Owen kept his peace
happen next
was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch
passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice
did you get by the desk ''
curiously
sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the corridors , knocking on strangers' doors and talking down Eskimos ''
, I just come once a week
I visit a different hotel
it's my duty
this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these lay-sisters
know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities
in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day ''
you have any idea how far I travel every day
the whole Pacific Northwest ''
aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself
Parker drew back
hardly a Christian approach '' , she remonstrated
in the secular world ''
didn't say it was Christian
think you'll find many active Christian salesmen
religion isn't big business ; ; those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses , but they don't get top personnel
salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics ''
, I take it , plays no part in this '' , she said waspishly
doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics '' , he said heatedly before he caught himself
silly ; ; why go on
were passing ; ; he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation
whiskey '' , she said , smiling and blinking at the highball glasses
forget whiskey ; ; it's such a big seller ''
know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` I think you're going to have to excuse me
an appointment ''
can imagine '' , she said
down at the bar
do you want to do about the lay-sisters
be freezing up there now
help them ''
a card or something
it over ''
have no card '' , she said bitterly
haven't been listening to what I've been telling you
hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual bucking-up ''
crestfallen , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race
indecisively for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ; he heard her knocking on another door
him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ; then he realized he was hungry
, shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast
way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail
a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued
had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's exemptions
breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto Virginia Street , he felt braced
off to the crest of the Sierras , still white-topped ; ; the glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle
suddenly elated , adventurous
luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot
was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the Golden Calf
were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded
test himself , he played roulette for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars
was opening up ; ; when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach
Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon
more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a flowerpot
had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up
around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons , who appeared much more animated than the gamblers
had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful
of course , except the Donner party who were bent on starving to death
wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , Owen mused
down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes
a dirty word and left
surprised to see Mrs. Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance
down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical devices , and Owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support
cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place
a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables
you need is a steady martingale '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play
can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen ''
are you playing ''

just logging '' , the cowboy explained
keep all these plays in this little black book , and I watch over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers are repeating
not my game
trying to find a breaking table in blackjack
I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The Wrangler ''
to know you
have to spend any time on your ranch ''
, of course I do
the Bar-H , pushing a horse called Sparky
own horse , and what I collect from him I use on blackjack
can rack and single-foot and he's the fastest thing in Washoe County
if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going , I'll land him on TV -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some Western hero
trained a horse for Hoot Gibson , but nothing like Sparky
pinto and he photographs wonderfully ''
up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars
conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to Hurrays , an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf
looked in the back , Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards
spirit had waned ; ; he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction
a long redhead with green eyes , but she was a shill with her money in front of her
no great prejudice against shills ; ; it just seemed such a dry run
no cash around ; ; everyone was flipping silver dollars
discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points
a special announcement whereby Hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three A.M. starring Adele ( The Body ) Brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls
if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him
two brides , both wearing orchids , and they made him feel a little sad
Buzz watching chuck-a-luck
on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses
shorter and fatter than Owen , who felt good standing next to him
all going over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva '' , Buzz explained , still instigating
ran into a guy at the Pagan Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel
out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading
knocking down checks at faro ''
allergic to Tahoe '' , Owen explained
about the pollen ''
, okay '' , Buzz said
see you around later ''
over to the crap table and the dice were hot , but he couldn't pyramid with any consecutive success
your luck , honey ''
platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him
well-fed and prosperous , but he didn't get the impression he was being propositioned the way he'd been hoping
haven't had any luck since I was a baby ''
me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice
them dance the tango
it in a hurry and get it out ''
have a drink and discuss a merger ''
you go broke '' , she said , smiling up at him , `` I'll leave you ''
like real love '' , Owen said

wanted to call me Sylphide , but it sounded too affected ''

, `` Answer me properly , Spencer ''

well ''
away
, he thought , had its moments of grim humor
had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain , yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address
morning hours , it became clear that the arrest of Spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the Somers
in the Greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty , so as to be near Spencer , watching an opportunity to communicate with him

breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news that the handspikes , heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places
also , sir , two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely
knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green
overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into Spencer's possession and that '' -- `` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser
to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who '' -- He was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder , with Gansevoort and Heiser behind him
revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away
milling about of what had been a well-trained , well-organized crew struck Alexander with horror
orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched , too , the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction
hastened to Alexander's side
violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast
him myself and it was done after consultation with Cromwell
it , sir ''
was clear that Adrien was not mistaken , for both Small and Cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till Philip Spencer had given the signal to obey
with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work
that they had planned confusion and turmoil , thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed
was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip Spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated
mast was raised , Alexander gave the order for Small and Cromwell to be placed under arrest , and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the Somers
followers were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse , expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons , communicating with the three by glance and signal
the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after Midshipman Tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by Seaman Wilson
reported the man to Gansevoort and an hour later , with back turned , had been attacked by Wilson , brandishing the weapon
shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , McKee and McKinley
man on the brig , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny
tiny cabin , Alexander met with Gansevoort , Heiser and Wales to speak and to listen
had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears
, `` It requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely
the Greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed
aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate ''
'' , Heiser ventured , `` why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and '' -- `` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander broke in
is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners
suppose we hold a court of inquiry , then what
have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the United States , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order
, does this sound like a truly workable plan to you
not think these men might choose the black flag here and now ''
, `` Of course they would
about to do so at any moment as it is
is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead
as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed
going to be rushed and murdered ''
is extravagant language , Mr. Wales
not going to be rushed and murdered '' , Alexander said
are going to bring the Somers into New York harbor safe and sound ''
course , I agree with the Captain '' , Gansevoort said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate
of discipline has been lost
possible when anarchy has the upper hand ''
, then added , `` Everything on a ship is a weapon
wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands
are positive of so few and suspicious of so many ''
ourselves must stand sentinel ''

us present , the Perry brothers , Deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the Somers
deal of labor we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed ''
he was alone again in the cabin , Alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done
his heart he had loved the Navy and now he must act in accordance with the Navy's implacable laws
he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul
he failed
he failed
had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer
to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven
given or it was not given
one's best and if fortune smiled , there was a reward
one's best and if fortune frowned , an eighteen-year-old boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one's ship
sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had , and he felt no shame
his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career
had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist
for love that he had served the Navy
someday that love returned was what he had lived for
hope was gone
he would bring the Somers safely into New York harbor but at a price
, at what a price
a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity
he inspected the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason
averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger
, the giant boatswain , was mild-mannered and respectful
, `` Captain , may I speak , please
I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship ''
you , Cromwell ''
, sir
I swear I am innocent
nothing of any plot , if there is such a thing ''
are the only man aboard who can be in doubt ''
cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent ''
closer to Alexander , squinting up at him from the deck
, Captain , you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything ''
, Cromwell , I did not find your name
careful about that ''
, seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke
, `` Cromwell is telling you the truth
innocent ''
his gaze to Spencer
and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend Cromwell
Spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled
a sudden wave of painful clarity , Alexander recognized a kinship with Spencer
another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable
good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth
nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune
captain , towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer
lad had forged his own shackles
could not have done so , could not have found the way , had fortune favored him
fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired captain , they would be each other's undoing
, if there is guilt , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell to be innocent
your constant companion ''
eyes met Alexander's
tell you he is innocent ''
do you think there is a reason why I should accept your word ''

nothing to gain by defending Cromwell ''
to lose , either , Spencer ''
true '' , Spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation
went back to contemplation of the sea
am innocent , Captain '' , Cromwell said again
God , Captain , I am innocent ''
it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell
was as guilty as any
of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen , prior to their knowing the significance of the Greek paper , had seen it in Cromwell's hands while Spencer whispered explanations
thought '' , Midshipman Rogers had told Alexander , `` that Spencer was teaching him geometry ''
fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him
a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized
these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer's followers
me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah
trash lay in the roadway
smelled warmish and foul
man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides
a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles
hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high
head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead
a pinkish-white complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled paot
suddenly conscious of my bare arms
in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings
and watched him stride down the center of the road
were swinging at his sides , and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and , pivoting on his heel , he entered an old stone building
seen me watching the young man

your mother was here he must have been a young boy
ones you will see now ''
hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside Rachel
me into a twisting side alley
, discolored buildings looked boarded up , and their few windows stood high above our heads
that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings
one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor
man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat , baggy trousers , and a black skullcap greeted us
to him
, clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch , and flicked glances at me
he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were bare-armed , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor
pointed out toward the walls
in front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom
inside
us
crowded together on long wooden benches , and in the center of the room sat the teacher
beard dripped down over the front of his coat
hand poised a stick above his desk
his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in Yiddish , `` One , two , three ''
stick against the desk
boys shrilled out a Yiddish translation or interpretation of the Five Books of Moses , which they had previously chanted in Hebrew
a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick
opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of Europe
were tiny
large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces
over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher
did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that there was a penalty for distraction
language from the ghetto stopped
plunged the children into a new portion , this time in Hebrew , rapping the stick incessantly
who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles
curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders
center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap
barely rose above the table
at him for a long time
not return my interest
traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys
them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago
the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick
defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake
not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair
pitched back and forth on the bench
teeth were missing
and backed out of the room
, looked at me , and clucked with her tongue
down the cool hall silently
us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer
, `` How long do they keep that up ''
day '' , she said
for Shabbat , when they are praying all day ''
my hands together
turned numb and prickly in the classroom
man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps
down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish
, `` He asks for money ''
by him
into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin
picked it up again and handed it to the old man
me
look at him
at Rachel
this bother you ''

to herself
of our Sabras think it's horrible
were fighting , a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass
that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah ''
amazed
to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home
to be stupid or crazy or immortal
wasn't
American
to know , also , that you were going to fail
it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place
them
me
eyes were twinkling
, `` Sometimes I think they are keeping religion for us while we play around
hated this way of life
to change much for the children here ''
quietly , respectfully , `` What did she do here
section ''
her tongue behind her teeth
, nothing
she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the kibbutzim
the children
a strange woman , your mother
loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved
too impossible for her to do when she wanted
here to work for Aliah
immigrants , for many children , the first thing they knew of Israel and freedom was your mother
was dangerous for her ''
slyly
she loved danger
it with her wherever she went ; ; she chose it
think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people
most strange woman
follow her impulse
an impulse when she was here in Me'a She'arim -- I was with her -- that led her to stay in Israel
wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos
did not need to be in ghettos
could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms
out to make sure that no Jewish child anyplace in the world had to live in a place such as this ''
quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be rebuffed , `` Then why did she leave Israel
to know that very much ''
her hands together and slowed her pace
of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones
her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me
sighed and her face relaxed
came into her life
good friends here , people who liked her
her
had to go out and hurt herself
a man here in town
her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted
very hard
a refugee who was able to come here because of her
with his son
I thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so
was a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a strut to his walk as I have never before seen
the black numerals on his arm , so he had been branded in a concentration camp
walked like a young man
was terribly despondent and talked to no one
would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe
family was dead , except for his son
would always retrieve him when he wandered off , and she would send him home to his son
the son and was always glad to be sent back to him
son did something '' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` I don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the Mandate -- and the son was imprisoned
hours after the son was arrested , your mother was informed
from a little group of us
sitting together , talking
to the father and found he had hanged himself ''

silent in the stone alley
continued with energy , `` I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father
saw her except the man Reuveni ''
'' , I said
know him ''
me a direct , bright-eyed look
, `` Reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee
she would only hurt herself
to me once that I must talk to her
did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him
her if she would , and she said she would not
known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him
I did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself
to me one day
pale and skinny ; ; she was terribly alone
said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni and accepted his proposal
at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself
he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her
never let her harm herself again
whole week he never let her stay alone
him lead her around
her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was
her with him wherever he went
not let her talk to people ; ; he did not let her choose her own food
limp and beaten from her loss ; ; she did not care
I'll take you with me ''
of them against the world
been how she imagined it
he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans as he went , she had begun dreaming too
the dream was over
waking up had happened
did I imagine ''

I see him about to swing low in a chariot
poling up the south fork of the Forked Deer River braving the wastes dumped in it
saw him on a barge with a gang of Ethiopians poling it ''
take you with me
taken her all right
after youth fellowship
the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving
bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when Gratt went out for ice , the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened
Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along
and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and Toonker Burkette back in his office yanking out teeth , like they all knew he would
the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen
could hope the parachute wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm to Starkey Poe in his suit of red underwear , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid -- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice : `` I think I'm pregnant ''
wish that
could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night
sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off , because that is being an old maid too , if you happen to drive a car , it is changing the tire yourself in the night , and in the mud and the rain , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help
sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell , a combination like ham and eggs , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid too
not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull
of all it is not having the only man you could love , whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds , or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one
even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even Houdini couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked
can be on the way to Memphis , your Gratt Shafer can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him -- really want him -- dead
you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him
don't share him , not even with God
is love , you don't
take you with me
that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give , the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie
he is on the way to Memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift , and it is he inside of you
a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart
him every mile further away
where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't
know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy , the chump who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't afford and the too-shiny shoes
: `` Did he feel that way about me ''
to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have Gratt Shafer ; ; that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy
on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you , he was a man , and that because Gratt Shafer was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt Shafer's substitute , that other guy
wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success
if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you
about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you
the world '' , she thought
out at the corn field , the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence bordering the grounds
envisioned factories there
factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments
were impatient , but they were the only ones
, the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City
like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing
good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States some day
stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it , not listening exactly , but rather , feeling
man was good , if he was going to be governor , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever
sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too
a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it
and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit , and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm
the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought
talked you wouldn't trade being a West Tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world , no matter if it hadn't , in six weeks , rained enough to wet a rat's ass
at the man nodding beside her , a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks , with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen , reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in August -- yes , with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only June , only festival time again and thoughts of Gratt Shafer would not leave her
should have stayed at the store '' , she thought
the Factory-to-You with the other old maids , back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions , like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down
no lock because Herman didn't allow a lock
on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping
hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place because you couldn't keep the public out -- entirely
not count the times Herman had rapped on the door , just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might , someday , break away the pipe connections from the wall
little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out , by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot
hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on Saturdays and during sales , and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor
, we three handled quite a few small commissions , from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs
us had his own specialty besides
wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature : hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight-by-ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's glass
drew precise crisp spots , which he sold to various literary and artistic journals , The New Yorker , for instance , or Esquire
book jackets and covers for paperback reprints : naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway , daring the cops to take him , is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver
could be The Brothers Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration
once I did a jacket for Magpie Press ; ; the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth-century armor , furnishings , clothes
ferreted out the materials from which shields were made -- linden wood covered with leather -- so I'd get the light reflections accurate
the art editor , took one look at my finished sketch and said , `` Nothing doing , Rufus
first place , it's static ; ; in the second place , it doesn't look authentic ; ; and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold ''
, `` Mr. McKenzie , it is as authentic as careful research can make it ''
, `` That may be , but it isn't authentic the way readers think
from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like Little Lord Fauntleroy , and only the villains had beards
couldn't have dressed like that -- it isn't transparent enough ''
end , I did the same old picture , the naked girl and the guy in the doorway , only I put a Lord Byron shirt on the guy , gave him a sword instead of a pistol , and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie
as happy as a clam
authenticity '' , he said
Donald , he actually sold paintings
painted in our spare time , and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it
; ; he sold perhaps three or four a year , and usually all to Joyce Monmouth or her friends
style , a real inner vision of his very own
strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults
the freshness of color , the freedom of perception , the lack of self-consciousness , but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye
to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted
have been true for all I know , because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles , but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting
had , at times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker ; ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald , you've got Prussian blue all over your shirt '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well
thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting
all gravy , and Donald didn't need much to live on ; ; none of us did
the expenses of the studio , and we all lived within walking distance of it , in cheap lodgings of one kind or another
life class was my idea -- or rather , Askington's idea , but I was ripe for it , and the other two wouldn't have gone if I hadn't talked them into it
to paint again
done a serious picture in almost a year
just the pressure of work , although that was the excuse I often used , even to myself
the kind of work I was doing , the quality of the ambition it awoke in me , that kept me from painting
saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an illustrator -- like Peter Askington , for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint ''
a kind of goal I set myself ; ; I had admired him long before I talked to him
to me as though he had everything an artist could want , joy in his work , standing in the profession , a large and steady income
we first met , at one of Mrs. Monmouth's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; ; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade
his tone : richness of texture and color , and another kind of richness as well , for his clothing and decorations would have paid the Brush-off's rent for a year
fifteen years older than I -- forty-four -- but full of spring and sparkle
look like what I thought of as an old man , and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger
one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America ; ; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month
included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the East Sixties ; ; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain
a long talk with him
into Mrs. Monmouth's library , which had low bookshelves all along the walls , and above them a Modigliani portrait , a Jackson Pollock twelve feet long , and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background , that looked like an inscription from a Martian tomb
had tiles made for Mrs. Monmouth by Picasso himself
expensive restaurants , just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself
course of our talk , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying
yourself ''

, I take classes with different people '' , he said
don't think I've reached the point , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft
it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere , an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters , as Durer went to Italy to meet Bellini and Mantegna ''
a circle with his thumb and fingers
isn't this big , you know
embrace only the artist , alone before his easel
as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous ''
his arms wide , his face shining
artist is like a fragment of a mosaic -- no , he is more than that , a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic
these days , I'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days , from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism , and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other
is all , inward or outward
what a title for the exhibition : The Eye is All ''
do you study ''

fascinated ; ; just listening to him made me feel intelligent
studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied
you know him
at the Manhattan School of Art ''

studied with Burns ten years before , during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me , along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on Hudson Street
I had not loved each other
also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima '' , he went on , `` and twice a week I go to a life class taught by Pendleton ''
Pendleton ''

God , is he still alive
be a million years old
to a retrospective of his work when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne's ''
quite ''

about sixty , now
, still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms
makes the city look like one of Thoreau's hangouts
admired him , and when I heard he was taking a few pupils , I went to him and joined his class ''
, it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter ''
missing the point '' , he said
has the magical eye
is a great man
him is stimulating
the trouble with so many artists today
stimulation
alone in their rooms and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life
of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation
Middle Ages , in the Renaissance , right up to the early nineteenth century , the painter was a giant in the world
an artisan , a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did
a real need , showing society what it looked like , turning it inside out , portraying its wars and its leaders , its ugliness and its beauties , reflecting its profound religious impulses
a propagandist -- they weren't afraid of the word , then -- satirist , nature lover , philosopher , scientist , what you will , a member of every party and of no party
at us today
safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity
of amateur dervishes
need is to get back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school ''
certainly talk
of the evening was that I got the address of Pendleton's studio -- or rather , of the studio in which he gave his classes , for he didn't work there himself -- and joined the life class , which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve in the morning
an awkward hour , but I didn't have to punch any time clock , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job
short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work
mostly for the benefit of the mailman , because hardly anybody else ever visited us
way , Askington was right
'' was the word for it
know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it to be
it was because Pendleton himself wasn't what I anticipated
come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars
that isn't quite fair
there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week
little thing to start with -- the car registration
, where is the car license ''

can't find it in the glove compartment ''
must have it '' , I answered readily enough , recalling her last visit
'' , she was frowning
should Via have it ''
forgotten she had signed the car away , that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children
silent
want to stir things up
drive my own car by courtesy of Via ''
sure she'd turn it over to you , if you'd rather
that ''
as if she were accusing me of some fraud
must have taken the registration when she went to Walter's
her ''
, thank you
nothing of Via's ''
this suddenly assail her
giving me checks for my pay , the household bills
been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind
a fool I've been '' , she said quietly
knew all this , but I paid no attention
even own the house I'm standing in
so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things `` It narrows down down down and finally there is no way out
am not to be Mrs. Salter I am nothing ''
I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark , but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in
you , I hate you , I feel like killing you and myself , and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on , meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living
went about my business
a lemon sponge , a light dessert , roasted a chicken , parboiled some frozen vegetables , so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend
bother , Ida '' , she said
have these appointments in town for Saturday , and I'll probably spend Sunday with Dolly or the Thaxters ''
, I thought , she's recovering her spirits
movie-to-be in London , and new faces about her there , she would soon be a more tranquil , a wiser person , all the better for her stay out here
more cheerful , as if I had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself
went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life
foggy that evening , but the path to my house was so well grooved that I could feel my way , accustomed as I was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river and sometimes last for days
morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village I crept along with my headlights full on
notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the fog I assumed Mrs. Salter had done the same before she left for town
my shopping , had my dentist appointment , and from there I went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual Christmas bazaar , so that dusk was beginning to gather when I drove home in the late afternoon
next day -- Sunday
when I drove down to church , didn't it speak to me , seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear
to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , unsee
came back from church at noon Mrs. Thaxter was turning into the Salter driveway
a car's length I could sense that something was wrong , and so I followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house
was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us
nowhere , nowhere ''
, and both women ran up to the house , and I followed
began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening closets , talking , exclaiming in rushes and gasps
as I had left it the night before last -- her portfolio and bag for town , her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing

telephoning began
who until that day before had been Mrs. Salter's friend , her equal , was the servant now
Dolly and Mrs. Thaxter who were calling Via , everybody
they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me
I brought them sandwiches and coffee I had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait
the kitchen I recalled every word Mrs. Salter said that could have been a sign to me
I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing ''
that alarm me then
she returned from taking her guests back to New York she had said , `` All they talked about was Harvie Harvie this , Harvie that When they know the truth will they drop away from me , will I become a nothing ''
I remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to Rome I had heard her boast , over and over again , `` On the boat people liked me for myself ''
made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage , just to check
night I had called , but the line was always busy and it reassured me
it was one of those hour-long conversations with Dolly or Constance , she comfortable in bed
seemed not from what they were saying
it a final desperate plea from her , to whom
and on past any man's patience some final stab of conclusion
found the day after at the bottom of the cliff
to believe that what must have happened was that , restless , disturbed by this telephone call or whatever , she walked out in the night , as she had a habit of doing
took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff
romantic up there , she used to say , with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night , so poetic
that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock , a misstep
didn't really think it was as simple as that , nor did anyone else
fisherman brought her up in his arms , still , small , as if she were a child asleep , I began to shudder with a terrible excitement , almost triumphant , that I still cannot account for
a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks
last the vigilance , the will gives way
was it that , before Via , Sonny , Walter and all , I began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out , `` I knew she'd do it
''
at me and drew back
turned cold and accusing , even Via's
have never changed
same time that I thought I understood her at long last and pitied her , underneath this knowing had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate , an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry
what had given way in me
I am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are
absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family I considered my very own , but there it hangs , a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other
time I was filled with self-pity at this separation , but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry
person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it , I can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne
not their avoidance that rankles ; ; it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of the family , and therefore of mine , and they nod to me so coolly and walk away , that it hurts
tell them , but no one ever asked , why I had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body
I forget Mrs. Mathias , who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened
me ; ; she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country
all feel guilty '' , I turned away from her coldly
was nobody's fault
her hand ''
do you mean ''

put such a high value on being top dog ''

coarse , almost insulting , this harsh appraisal , and she has never come to see me since
she had not taken Mrs. Mathias' advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns , dispossessed of love , hanging on to makeshifts , and altogether and finally arid
chose , and in that final decision discarded , what , above all , all of us value , life itself , must she not have risen to her fullest height , and transcending her murky self , felt at last the passion of a great moral decision
say I could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination , her search into herself and its conclusions
I had cried out that I knew she'd do it , but without my fully realizing it at the time , it was a cry of triumph for her , praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed -- and guilt
finally at rest in truth , of her own proud free choice
with my darling Ellen , the first Mrs. Salter
came home
service was in the house , the Methodist minister , how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside , a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words , and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment , seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed

called to say they had decided to cremate her -- as they had Ellen , the thought leaped to my mind -- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning
stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor , on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses I had ordered
, just for decency I thought at the time , but found myself whispering , `` Our Father which Art in Heaven '' And it was only after that that something unlocked in me and I felt a grief
in the parking lot when I went outside
waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey
time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths
felt impelled to kneel , and reached back and pulled Via down
come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of Bach would give her some healing
had a rather small place of my own
bachelor apartment in a place called the Lancaster Arms ''
'' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid
then I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio ''
''
not a man who has many close intimate friends , Carla '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him
, I'd drink with newspaper people
I was what you might call a convivial man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive
think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with ''
he waited for her to turn , to ask a question
no interest at all in the life he had led back home , and it hurt him a little
, what about you , Carla ''
''
, turning slowly
about me ''
you make friends easily ''
, uhhu ''
I imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot
it ''
guess so '' , she said taking a Kleenex from her purse
had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth , she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror
your people still alive ''
, trying to touch a part of her life Alberto hadn't discussed ; ; so he could have something of her for himself
talk so well , Carla '' , he went on
seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift for words '' , he added , trying to flatter her vanity
must have been good at history at school
you go to school ''
is this ''
, turning suddenly
you know all about me by this time
Carla Caneli
my town
with you
something more about me every day , don't you
be happier if I made up some stories about my life , told you some lies
you trying to worry me ''
not trying to worry you ''
, all right then ''
tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing
he had been a clean orderly man , and now he had to hide his annoyance
just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance

have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen , the bathroom , and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor , then hang up her dresses , pick up her stockings , make the bed while she lay around
up , ready to vent his exasperation , then grew afraid
dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her , and without the respect he might lose his view of her , too
the matter ''
suddenly

all '' , he said quietly
go out ''
those the only shoes you have , Sam ''
the matter with them ''
heavy thick soles
them ''
an expensive English shoe for walking around a lot
them ''
, no one around here wears such heavy soles
get another pair ''
I could '' , he said , surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him
get an elegant pair of thin-soled Italian shoes tomorrow , Carla ''
I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face
the matter with it ''
put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had encountered her on the street
, Sam
like a tweedy Englishman
wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged ''
don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention
clothes , he put on his dark-blue flannel suit , and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good
was a hopeful sign , he told himself
longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in Parioli
they loafed around , just getting the feel of the city
at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via Veneto , then they went to the Farnese Gardens
some amusing scandal about the Farneses in the old days
took a taxi to Trastevere
a church you should see '' , she said
they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face , not letting on he had been there with Alberto
her tell him all about the church
had dinner
she was eloquent and pleased with herself
got home at midnight she was tired out
the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing
never heard so many bells , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the Spanish Steps
a good thing that she clung to her religion , he thought
like to take him to St. Peter's
, wake up '' , he said shaking her
ten o'clock
going out to mass
take me to St. Peter's ''
'' , she muttered
on , you'll be late ''
think I'll sleep in this morning '' , she said drowsily , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went to church
he want her to go to church
Probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security
be good for her
too bad he had no feeling himself for church
poor mother's fault
have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible
himself , he just didn't have the temperament for it
time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know
thought of those Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel
out of a tribal folklore
honestly believe it would be good for Carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now
woman though , she would take only what she needed from church
too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself
Protestant , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists , or a strict orthodox Communist
the matter with him that they all wearied him
the times , he was sure
ideologies changing from day to day , right under his eyes , so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom
all too wearying
else

same , he thought , pondering over it , it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she got up and went to church
hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the Ferraros , hearing them hurrying down the stairs , would think they were going to a late mass
to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla
we're having coffee with them this afternoon '' , he said , `` I think I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us ''
waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam
little to do ''
not ''

not good at that kind of thing ''
afternoon let's take an air with them
fine superior people of great dignity '' , he said as if he were joking
you find it necessary , Sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the stair
am what I am
help it ''
remained with him , worrying him for hours
know how she would behave with other people
walked into the Ferraro apartment , the old lady , bowing and smiling , said softly
, '' and put out her hand
brown face wrinkled up , her brown eyes gleamed , and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things
smiling too , said , `` 'ello '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy ''
sat down and began their little coffee party
offered them biscuits with the coffee
as interpreter Carla , her hands folded on her lap , was utterly impersonal
turn to them , then turn to him , then turn again
, he felt like a spectator at a tennis game , with the ball being bounced back and forth
, bobbing her head encouragingly , asked Sam about Canada , having a special interest

woman had a nephew from North Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrated to Canada to work on the railway
year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar
of Sam's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush
ever lived in a boxcar
to know
explained that he had no experience with boxcars
same , the old woman said , she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country
thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew back home , and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope
great Pope , this one , the old woman explained , her black eyes sparkling

mystical too
said that he had had a vision
thousands that day in Portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky , he had seen the same thing later in his own garden , and she turned to Agnese for confirmation
been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity of the unaware
little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes
Father would die soon , she said to Carla , so she could translate for Sam , although he had a brilliant doctor , a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world
the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint
he was indeed a saint now
and swelling with importance , the old lady whispered confidentially
a certain discontent among the cardinals
, in the splendor of his great intellect , had neglected them a little
be changes made , and Signor Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome
be lost and new faces would become prominent
Raymond understand
did , Sam said solemnly , trying to get Carla's eye
could see that these women were her Italians , too , he thought
orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland
eyes were on Agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness
, watching in wonder , turned to Sam
means so much to her
a flame , I guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone
night Dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's lodge , where Shades of Night had gone to purify herself
blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill caressing the flageolet with his lips , making it whisper
her emerge suddenly , coming in her unhesitant fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach
dark , scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding
come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart bounce in him , and turned away , afraid now
, wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil presences in her metabolism more
caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off
he saw as often before some queer , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs
out to her , his back turned
fled , not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry
heard him go
did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp
heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small , curious clusters
came from her bed , from beside her half-drunk husband , Walitzee , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion , the sound of hushed voices
she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her
last she could suffer the insult no longer , nor face the girl's scorn , she said in a voice overloud : `` I shall call your father
where you can bring no harm , or I will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame ''
girl said only , `` Tell him I am here , that I have come ''
was not Pile of Clouds she meant
with real anger at last , something proud and indignant , Early Spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried , `` I will not shriek at you
tell you to go , not begging
''
the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side
bring only wickedness '' , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal
a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife
take helsq'iyokom , your evil spirit , to the young boys '' , the woman said
do not have to face battle
not let your evil in
simply kill you first
''
women had come close now , their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats mingling , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt
up sticks and hurled them at the girl
fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs
all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought
did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly Pile of Clouds came howling among them , swinging a great bullhide whip
back to your lodges ''

pack of dogs makes less noise ''
the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some tripping over themselves in their flight
Spring seized the whip and said : `` If you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter
demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband ''
old man turned on her , jerking the whip from her hand
into your hovel ''

back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women
back , if you must tell me what to do
be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin ''
before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where Walitzee stirred , mumbling , sitting up in a half stupor to say : `` What worrisome thing happens
I dreamed of wolves fighting ''
went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness , smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from TuHulHulZote
, `` There is nothing that concerns you here
and go to sleep
not dream
let the wicked spirits enter your brain ''
back , sighing , and was soon asleep again
the old man , beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms
shoving her against a spruce , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air , shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked , settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged , as dark and motionless as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face
to him , her father , `` How was I begotten , in pain or joy
for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me
know your foolish name ''
at the pale tracings on the tree , hearing her breath refracted from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark
the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables words which had no meaning , like , `` unnnt

of an animal in rage and despair
lash stopped fighting the air and she heard Pile of Clouds say in his high , quavering voice : `` Did you follow me to see my shame
the line or I will settle the whip on you

hear the anger of the whip's whine ''
the girl saw Dookiyoon standing between , his narrow shoulders unbent , his arms hanging long and resigned
, `` Let me take her blows , for there are demons in me too ''
without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid , listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry
while the young men waited outside the lodge of TuHulHulZote , glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself
like a hoarse old mastiff , his hair stiff and bristling
and prophesied the doom of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , gasping draughts until finally , incoherent and sick , he fell into his own oblivion
the young men who had been silent long enough
could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics
moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them
out and held their games and races
they who held the future in their hands
into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons
the paxam wildly at night , the war dance , and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers , firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal
among them , and Sarpsis , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing
very young one , Swan Necklace , tried to emulate them and followed timidly
was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked
spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction , because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices
young men , Alokut among them , challenged them in matched racing
and maneuvered for war , swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry
they would ride frenziedly through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their regalia
they would stand in circles making other preparations
their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love
his leggings with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees
himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow , hurtling with a mad grace , his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue
always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , admiring him
suspicious , envenomed eyes of Pile of Clouds
of Early Spring , haunted and now full of hurt and envy
so much like laughing ; ; even like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs
Sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men
give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance
ride with streaming amulets , their colors ripening in the sun , shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death
the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts
their horses and rode off into the hills
young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening
rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , disheveled hoofs of the Appaloosas , horses the white men once had called the Dogs of Hell
them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge
with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , multicolored legion , their hair flying like dark banners , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them
into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted , ejaculated their grotesque cry of war
moving through a screen of hemlocks , in among the white birch and maples
from the quarry began to pulse in her ears
, once more listening
never been here at this hour
as if some dark , totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm ; ; but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ; and she walked easily now , and more slowly , until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her
ever committed suicide , she thought , I would dive straight down from here -- and no one would find me for days
, and expertly let herself downward , holding this known root or that , her sneakers sliding in the leaves
out onto the flat expanse of rock and , seating herself , shook her short-cut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward
music of the frogs had faded , but presently it began again , growing in volume until it was vibrant
at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees
accomplished a miracle
her place
couldn't change it
only -- her thoughts were a little strange
becoming confused
was because it was so late , and because she had no business to be here now
thinking of Paul a few weeks ago , in the Easter holidays , with her at one of those awful Friday Evening Dancing Class parties her mother had made her attend
, Julie , how are you ''
off he went so casually , to someone else with breasts better developed , more obvious in a lower-cut dress , someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him
he was with me now , she thought , and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment

I were older or younger , Julia Bentley thought
so much someone loved me
remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night -- Millie , in a white robe , standing like a ghost at the threshold
vanished ; ; he must have slept again
staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him
too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ; but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning
was like a prison
not be indebted to Sam
, as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner
fumbled across the bandages
left both of his eyes uncovered
he told himself , let's put the show on the road
walking across to the bathroom
a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands
pain had come from his head , as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them
his jacket and trousers
was dark ; ; the stains weren't too apparent ; ; and there were his shoes , thank God , but his shirt was one terrible mess
, and then tore away the blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf
be amazed to find him gone
have to understand
have put his clothes in the closet
a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness
on the verge of tears
-- in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman
Alex had told him he wasn't dying
Rawlings would be better off dead
was it
at his wristwatch
it was still running
to seven
for a vacuum cleaner , but probably Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs
kneeling to tie his shoelaces
felt absurdly thick and clumsy
slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door
knew himself
some freak , two strands of adhesive tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of gauze , suddenly moist over his cheekbones
, however , was perfectly white
drinking another glass of water
after seven o'clock
supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall
take over
to think , but the main thing , the imperative necessity , was to leave before Sam Bentley was up and about , and before Millie detained him with sympathy
the hallway
actually walking down the stairs
up in the sky , above the clouds , and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away
, is that you ''
issued from the cavern of the hall below
not reply
that you , Father
''
moment he felt like a thief discovered
appeared under the arch leading to the dining room
gazing at him
George ''
trying to smile at her

be up , should you ''
-- I was just leaving here , Julie
set
to call a taxi ''
wearing some sort of gray blazer
overly tall , her brow knitted in concern
, at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying
about to leave myself
you off ''
leaving ''
going back to school '' , she answered
driving me
finishing breakfast
you told Mother you were going ''
him

don't want anyone disturbed , Julie
wish
a big one '' , he added
seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight
, won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something
a drink ''
, in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated , considerate , and yet perhaps partly scornful
to see her face more clearly
-- nothing at all '' , he said after a moment's hesitation
just wait for you here ''
his head against the wood paneling behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids
them
past
have to say good-bye upstairs
be long ''
a great favor , Julie '' , he said , `` please don't mention you've seen me ''
to anyone ''
-- please
call your mother as soon as I get home
so much easier ''
right '' She was staring at him
fine , Julie
you just go ahead ''
disappeared
feel a pulse pounding against the bandages
Sam's voice : `` George , what the hell goes on ''
have the strength to answer , he thought
couldn't have called a taxi
hear the footsteps overhead
the suitcase , which Julia was holding
up

more affectionate , but obviously Julia had respected his request
her hand

wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume , and that we could go to a theater together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew '' He stopped speaking
we ever knew what ''
, just sort of everything in general ''
nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace

an automatic phrase ; ; as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it

at him , `` Well
look at George Rawlings

steadily ahead into his entry
seemed on fire
shut his door with the brass number screwed to it
kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp
or two swallows , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain
telephoning
, Millie , I'm home

a peculiar way to think ''
just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers , of course ; ; she knew that
Jim's `` little '' sister Myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever flyaway , Myra
year older than I am , Lucy told herself
, come '' , Jim said , jollying Lucy a little
love you
''

Susan was not
busy feet , showering like raindrops , pattered around her room
be visiting her grandmother for only a few days , but even at seven she was a prudent soul ; ; she always packed for a lifetime , just in case
yet
in the house must be going with her ''
better step on it
long way to Websterville ''
young face was an expressive one , too ; ; as he looked at her , it registered anxiety
know '' , he said
wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy
only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful ''
not believe him ; ; Myra appreciated nothing
put the thanks in his sister's mouth
'' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend
should have told me herself
it be only a couple of weeks
happened the last time ''
with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ; but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them
that Myra would never have come home if Gregg , Myra's husband , hadn't gone out to fetch her
was an awfully long two weeks ''
otherwise silent moment , Jim's keys jingled nervously in his pocket
she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last
got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there -- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy in no time
, Myra's settling down ''
defensive , he added , `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow ''
depends on the widow ''
an idea that Myra loved it
for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down
to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life
succession of disasters , she now considered Cathy , an ominous child-cloud on her horizon
not that she disliked Cathy
drew her , troubled her depths ; ; whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or fuss , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra
was Myra's responsibility , not hers
wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said unhappily , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever ''
big cities ; ; thousands of miles away -- in Paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother
her too well to find it impossible
a horrible thing to accuse her of ''
so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy
to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , fiercely , `` Susan

''
piping sound returned
yell at Susan '' , Lucy said
only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river
around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ; their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them
from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had rung ; ; Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line
back from the stairway and looked at her
brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed
'' , he said
isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen
friends ''
weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ; they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage
thing that had ever come between them was that worthless , selfish sister of his
sick of it
, at last '' , she said , because Susan was clattering down the stairs
like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ; her arms were straining with a burden of dolls
ready '' , she announced
you need that big bundle ''

had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment
that junk ''
at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief ; ; to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart
, now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , mopping skillfully
father didn't mean it , Susan ''
Jim a quick , shape-up look of warning
take every one of them ''
, but he lifted Susan's suitcase and said , in a gentler tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand
you get back from Grandma's , Cathy will be here to play with you

'' , Susan said , grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a Scrooge-like effect
this point , Lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls -- but she could sympathize with Susan ; ; there ought to be a limit to sharing , too
one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit , short or long ; ; the last one had been a Lilliputian war
that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had
'' , Jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all ''
car , with Susan's hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , Lucy stood looking after its pale dust
was brilliant around her -- flower-scented , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it
let Jim go with a chilly good-by , a chillier kiss
sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that
and began to walk toward the house
feeding station , the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground , but now , gorgeous among them , was a beautiful red cardinal , radiant in its feathered vestments
bird was solitary ; ; its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest
better stay there , Lucy thought ; ; the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels
Lucy
to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds
a day of things to do ; ; among them , she had to prepare the guest room
would it be occupied
, with a baffled feeling of helplessness
as the unscrupulous Myra chose
moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself
only birds that dump their children in other people's nests
sunshine of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room
new yellow curtains , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new bedspread , lively with hopping rabbits , and hanging from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze
of little hangers waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ; since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed
was faintly fragrant with lavender , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost : Greg's house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , baffled , watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes
since his death that memory had worried and troubled her
the hall , the upstairs phone shrilled , and the small ghost vanished
picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there
Junction calling '' , she said
just thought I'd let you know
Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago
phoned sooner but I've been busy ''
can imagine ''
an active character ; ; for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be napping now , surrounded by her multitude of dolls
out the chair and sat down ; ; she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her
think yourself as grown up as Methuselah , yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic
was Cathy ''

was the merriest widow I ever saw ''
way to the airport , on her way to Paris -- you bet , Lucy said to herself
been fixing up the guest room for Cathy ''
a momentary pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay ''
for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them ''
'' -- This time there was a long silence , while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life
Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper ; ; her mother was forthright ; ; she was not usually given to mysterious silences
thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good
mean once Myra gets to Paris ''
soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted
seekingly , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know ''
was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do
Myra left -- She was saying good-by to Cathy , and she didn't realize I was near ''
, as though hunting over words and ways of putting them
was in tears , of course , and I heard Myra say , ' Now be good , and at Christmastime I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris ' ''
, Lucy sat there
jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake

it was no bogey she had dreamed up ; ; it was only too true
no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks
moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger thickened it
does it ''

keep Cathy for two weeks
if Myra does nothing about fetching her , I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself ''
tightened on the receiver
that's what I'm going to tell Jim ''
, the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end
hung up , she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings , and heard their grotesque singing

going to get away with it
tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path
thin legs were plodding
along slowly , both hands clutching a tired teddy bear
at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's house
, she was traveling light ; ; the worn teddy bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had
at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays ; ; they would have to buy things for her
the door
the dog plopped on the sand
blame Maggie for disbelieving
days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before Esperanza Beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards
sand made Quint's limp more pronounced
slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages -- eleven lemon , nine mint , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` Eats '' sign jiggling in the wind
were in friendly territory

sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge
was to the right of a V-shaped inlet , a big , brown , lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers
was special because no one on the beach could see him here
was enclosed and safe
a dragon or a sea monster came along , didn't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a corkscrew
was a perfect place to lie down and make believe
Canute controlling the waves

good thing about a suit of armor , his leg wouldn't show
was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature
six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to

when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light
bathroom can be pretty scary , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : Tomorrow , for sure , I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad
intended to make the promise
two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America
of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint
right
''
remember the feel of his father's big hands , the thump of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar
talk about the beach

I can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck

what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : `` Please , Lord Gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised ''
got a nerve ''
now to the clouds
to zip up and down his chest
strong as a giant
his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg
his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks
, goooolick '' , creaked a sea gull
, shut up '' , he said
on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean
bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , wedged between the rocks and the waves
go in
of the nightmare
he put on his clothes
with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water

holding on to his rock with one hand
of peppermints

a yawn
better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so
as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy Cross in the Korean War ; ; that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ; that he personally had an IQ of 141 and was currently reading the Mushr to Ozon volume of the encyclopedia

a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear
appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella
What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil
dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight ''
What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist

by her giggles he imitated Maggie who was crazy about ham
the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries , cooling on the porch
up on the ham like Maggie , gumming it with soft , stumpy teeth , then panting with thirst , lapping up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it
has to go ''
, you're quite a comic '' , Sabella said admiringly
thought about going on the stage ''

was such a nice thought that he nodded his head
that or a veterinarian ''
make up your mind , son '' , Sabella said

argued
sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward
agreed with Sabella
he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the V-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around

Mays in the outfield
gave me flowers before
, Quint ''
turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough
can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain je ne say quok ''
didn't talk at all
on the rock while she swam and splashed around
she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` Don't feel like it '' , he was tempted to tell her about being scared
began yodeling just then and he went home , carrying Sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of peppermints
his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time
it happened
eating breakfast
beseech thee , Lord Gord , to bless this food '' -- that was Victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib
breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement
Daddy's in San Francisco '' , she told them
says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane
early -- isn't that wonderful ''
, keen ''
seemed to be opening in Quint's stomach
, we'll have to get organized
can have an early nap
I want you to -- '' Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared
up , we're late '' , he said , noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and Kool-Aid green
in his stomach hurt
to go into the water
Sabella about the nightmare
started two years ago when he was in an iron lung
it , he didn't know
collar gagging his neck
much
weight on his chest
it together meant drowning
time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second
Evans smashed up his car , the Jaguar his wife Linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an afternoon's golf at Oakmont , it seemed to mark the end of a long , miswritten chapter in the social life of the community
remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath
Linda was heartless , not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than John Cooper would
been a perfect wife to Bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years
Cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been twenty-five years earlier
John's wife , Edythe , even more appalling , if possible
Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life
adult and realistic to look at it that way

that John Cooper had married Edythe on the rebound
the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his
course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart
John ''
the reproach , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the Allegheny Mountains , and John was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around Pittsburgh
had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the Golf Club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs
claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of Dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes
them always together those years
about John-and-Linda as an entity
at Longue Vue last night ; ; John-and-Linda drove to Conneaut in three and a half hours
was a spat over something , as there had been lovers' spats before ; ; only this one didn't heal
said `` John-and-Linda '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or Dillinger
worse instead of better
it came out after Mr. Cooper's will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more
there was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans
no connection between the two events , because Bobbie wasn't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John
a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did
said Linda had just announced the engagement to jolt John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers
even John and Edythe
simply Poor John
nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either
had been to school with her someplace near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at Horne's
, you shouldn't underestimate Edythe '' , Mousie said
know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained
frivolous and scatterbrained , but she really isn't shallow ''
Linda looked magnificent at their wedding
at the church with Edythe
during the ceremony , and Mousie Chandler , who was one of Linda's bridesmaids , said John glared black as death at her
if he were choking '' , she said
John ''
down to become a social myth and a horrible example
never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length
have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at Longue Vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart
didn't see her much at Longue Vue or anywhere , for John had drifted away from the gang
it was because he was too proud to stand pity
he couldn't stand seeing Linda , Mrs. Bobbie Evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything
less-dramatic reasons too
died not long after his marriage , and there was even less Cooper money left
the big old place in Sewickley and bought a smaller house in Fox Chapel
not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day
good at his job
wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but Edythe to come home to
may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John's first son , came along early in 1938 , the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from fontanel to pink toes , nary a trace of Edythe
continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in 1940 and Jack in 1944 -- and all John's success at his work only made Edythe's dizziness and general uselessness more glaring
could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda
was bridge at Edythe's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers
a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church ''
find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries
intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile
was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one
an attentive and generous husband , overgenerous , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him
got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ; after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company
saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary
been successful , too , though he didn't match John's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the Stuart money
Linda settled down to being social leaders , and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year
came the hairpin turn , the smashed Jaguar and Linda , mourning alone and lovely
his or her breath
think Linda couldn't have got John back any time , if she'd tried '' , Mousie Gordon , who had been Mousie Chandler , said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at Le Mont
you know she could've , but she isn't that kind of girl
-- well , it would be a blessing , I think
''
felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling
felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much sorrow for handsome , ambitious Bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death
what people were thinking ; ; it was what she had been thinking herself
up to her to save Poor John , dear John , to undo the wrong she had done , but she trembled at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream
no one who would blame her or John ; ; she could be sure of that
be rough on Edythe at first , but Linda and John between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her , to send her back to Cleveland or anywhere
felt capable of capturing the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of their own
be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of
have to wait , she knew
was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by
watching while Poor John struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead
, he had done wonders
and regular steels had different sales departments at Smith & MacIsaacs , where John and Bobbie both worked
been head of the alloy division , while John was just another good salesman in the regular branch
old Mr. Lovejoy , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with Carnegie-Illinois , it looked like the perfect chance for Bobbie
knew how to help her husband , not just the Stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for Reuben Lovejoy
almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job
did you do ''
Bobbie
must have done something , something wrong
I had everything set for you ''
something about damned Pittsburghers sticking together , and Linda got angry at him
their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk
her uncle , Donald Murkland , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened
a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision
old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand
tell her of the long board meeting where Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other
behind John Cooper '' , Mr. Lovejoy said finally
think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive
, I believe Poor John'll work just a little harder
wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance
with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities
, the money can't mean as much to Bobbie
will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ; Poor John will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us ''
the directors nodded
Murkland found himself nodding agreement too
surprise was over , Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck , though she agreed with Bobbie's decision some months later to move to Funk Furnaces
at Funk wasn't particularly better , but it got him away from being subordinate to John and assured him steady advancement , since Funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of Linda's family
rise continued to be meteoric
was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future
then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night
appreciated the chance to make some money
nice little thing -- lives right in the building ''
swell '' , I said sweetly
get along without that three dollars
ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer obligated to Nadine
past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang
through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour
to find Nadine at the other end
scared me half to death '' , I said shakily
wrong ''
, nobody answers at the apartment ''
came shrill
absolutely frantic
girl might have gone off and left Francie ''
, she wouldn't do that '' , I said
probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone
you're worried you can go home and check '' -- `` I can't leave the party
Ken Thom's apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat
Thom is already down on Wally , and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us '' -- I was all set for what came next
, could you possibly go over and make sure everything's all right
you there in ten minutes '' -- `` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- Wondering , as I said it , why I should make it at all
I go over at midnight to check on Francie , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party
minutes , then
Janice
glad to pay you '' -- So sure that money could do anything
right '' , I said
it
the dollar or so Nadine would give me
there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would
sound asleep , and I didn't see any sense in waking him
in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened
off through the cool darkness to Nadine's apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door
was flushed from sleep
all right '' , I said , as she started to look scared
Roberts had called , and couldn't wake you
came over to make sure everything was all right ''
-- hard to wake up '' , she faltered
look over thirteen
insisted that her sitters be reliable
have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on
didn't know it was going to be this late ''
started ringing
Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said
answer it ''
the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone
Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home
, would you mind staying ''
a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying
drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can , but I don't want Shirley to see him like this
how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' -- Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done
clicked in my ear
even give me a chance to refuse
there wasn't any law that said I had to stay
I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk
told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment
looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited
have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices
shrill with anger -- Wally's loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two
the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him
always thought she was so beautiful
she looked ugly
was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out , and if looks could kill , Wally would have been dead
your clothes '' , she hissed
-- and get out ''
crazy '' , Wally said thickly
and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep
over to him , and her pointed nails raked across his face
her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right , and she was crazy
stay out of this '' , she spat at me
ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us
Ken Thom ''
were wild
told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman
other people there were listening
and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' -- `` you'd better simmer down '' , I said nervously
plenty scared
state she was in , she could actually kill him
you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' -- `` Tea , '' Nadine screeched
can you be so damn stupid
his job
never forgive him -- never
don't have any money -- we don't have a dime
own is Francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them
be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours -- and all because of that '' -- I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth
that
up the whole building
go any place at this hour '' -- `` Well then , I'll get out '' -- But she looked uncertain
coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning
go to bed '' , I said curtly
the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' -- She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped
her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out
three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go
her , a limp bundle of self-pity , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her
snoring on the davenport
done all I could
done all I was going to do
not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine
home , found Chris still asleep
up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him
wasn't Nadine
on being thankful
afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with Francie
in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry
had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much
got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' -- Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally confessed , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired
the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side
had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him
thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said miserably
Ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises
was plastered and I blew my stack '' -- `` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman ''
to quiet Nadine because the children were there
was beyond caring what she said
may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern
couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved
they'd realize that life can be tough
bubble breaks , there's nothing
little , during the week , Chris and I discovered the crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived
not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks , owing on everything they owned
of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were evicted
all , Wally had no training for any kind of work
fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was stranded

wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over ''
I wished we were , too
easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent
brightened up like a candle
glad you feel that way , honey
one big way we can help them
let them move in with us '' -- Something I had simply never thought of
incredible -- I just stared at him
incredible -- He gave me an embarrassed , pleading look
know we'd be pretty crowded
would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out ''
-- They'd had years of making all that money
won't do it '' , I said flatly
was always too good to live in a little house like this
now she can sleep in the street for all I care ''
isn't like you , Janice '' , Chris said uncomfortably
felt uncomfortable , too
want to be like that , mean and bitter
darn it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us
in the end , we did
seemed as if there was nothing else to do
company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name
got sick
way of thinking , he was scared sick
had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world
trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries Nadine had bought on special
we'll eat , I thought grimly as I put all the food away
worked , Nadine sat and cried
wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally
infection nothing '' , she'd scream at him
too lazy to go out and look for another job
a no-good bum ''
a mess , all right
couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks , Chris had said
I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks
two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us
nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed
out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of alibis and excuses
had black-balled him
even take his application
can get something , '' Nadine would snap
can get a job working in a grocery store , if nothing else ''
high school kids have got everything sewed up '' , he said , a whine in his voice
damn punks -- taking work away from men who need it ''
fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging
was only the middle of July
couldn't take six more weeks of this
it to Chris one stifling hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air
really believe in intuition
swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day
it was the weather , so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital
it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late
rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all
just going to be one of those days
thousandth time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , nine-to-five , five-days-a-week profession
the thousandth time , I answered myself
chosen medicine -- it had chosen me
I shouldn't complain , I told myself in the shaving mirror
a lot to be thankful for
that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at
didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home
, we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was
lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it
the way Gladdy had turned out
without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been
mustn't start on Alice
a closed book , a picture I keep on my bureau , but never look at
kept on as she'd been going , the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow As usual , Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table
class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me
me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too
I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision
a feeling that young Pete Michelson , the most promising intern at Fairview , had something to do with it , too
out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little
I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the heaviness returned
and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking
tell him the truth about Alice
have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years
were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview
and Dick Ishii , the other resident
of Medicine here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds
down on Seven , Dick told me , and he'd meet us there
anything of special interest that morning , no one sicker than they should have been
to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he'd had a case of post-operative shock , but it was all taken care of now
a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then
finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor
a new one in last night '' , he said
haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a lulu ''
surprised
was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics
get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights
thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward
I walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed
her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk
was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name
this woman's name was Rose Bancroft
at the chart for reassurance
Rose Bancroft , diagnosis : acute alcoholism
about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four
scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face , already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry
hair was two-colored -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray
could it be
no it was an unfortunate resemblance , that was all it was , and I turned to Dick , forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind
low voice , Dick filled us in she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway
when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out
the old story
her a day or two , and the AA people would talk to her
she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left
the patient again , I -- I can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick
you , it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak
, Miss -- or is it Mrs. Bancroft ''
liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them , I've always thought , to chat first
one time I'd have gladly broken my own rule , but habit was too strong
''
was flat and dull
penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away
then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed
bloodspots on the sheet
this ''

period ''
her head
been spotting a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice
you spoken to a doctor about it ''
, there was a negative shake
Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table
do a Papanicolaou '' , I told Pete
only a few moments before Miss Groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal , but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination
by with a slide and took the smear , sent it down to the lab with a request for the test
, I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind
busy the rest of the day
the afternoon , I was up on Seven again
my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled
way to the elevator , I ran into Pete
got the results on the Bancroft smear test '' , he said
something there , all right
, they said
want to talk to her , Doctor ''
'' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again
was ridiculous , of course
right
a D. and C. and get her permission for a hysterectomy
nothing , maybe it's intraepithelial or in situ -- can't take any chances ''
you can keep her here that long '' , Pete said wryly
tells me she's started badgering already , wants to get out
get to her booze , I guess ''
in distaste
, better see what I can do ''
standing right outside Miss Bancroft's door and as I went to turn the knob to enter , I was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar
seemed to be dozing and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones
opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an inward shiver
sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said
just got through seeing one of you guys
you want ''
something almost insulting in her tone , but I disregarded it
just been talking to Dr. Michelson '' , I said
like you to have a dilatation and curettage
minor , nothing to worry about
would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it proves necessary ''
''
flat , definite
you let me explain
I rather doubt that we'll have to do this
we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably ''
sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor
''
at her in amazement
patients who'd refused surgery before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why
it was fear , but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet
you tell me why ''

, a smile without humor
shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door '' , she said
got cancer , haven't I ''
on , disregarding my protests
not going to be one of your guinea pigs
pupils learn on someone else , Doctor
me die in peace ''
at her , almost speechless
speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was
voice had taken on a more cultivated tone
someone who'd come down in the world , I thought
, long way down
was something familiar about her , something -- `` You haven't got cancer '' , I said as strongly as I could
don't know what you heard that would make you think so , but I assure you I don't even know myself , so how can you be so sure
if '' -- `` Don't give me a lot of talk , Joe ''
at her
have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult
was that something , some echo in the way she spoke
watching me intently , a funny little half-smile on her lips
, baby
changed , haven't I
haven't changed much , Joe ''
then , knew with a heart-stopping shock
'' -- I stammered through dry lips
, for goodness sake '' -- `` Alice '' , she echoed mockingly
the matter , Joe , you scared of me
going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife
don't worry
me outta here '' -- `` But why did you come back ''
my voice
have you been all these years ''

and there
coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where I was when I came to
thing I remember is a bar in San Diego '' -- The way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout , made me shudder
was Gladdy's mother
never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now
outta here
are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good
I want out , Joe ''
at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me
out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it
said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me
let her go , she'd disappear once more
would be safe
slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea
me welcome
cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's ; ; the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic
she soothed me , and drew me deeper into her
longer knew how deep I was , somewhere under 230 feet , getting drunker , happier and more contented by the second
for this dive seemed foolish now
dive itself had any meaning
nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water
I took off the aqua-lung I could swim better , love my woman better
aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out
hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part sorted over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time
when I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris
no vacation , just me getting out after a bellyfull
it wouldn't be the same
never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind
I had been to Paris , long before I married Valery
time was good and it stuck with me
twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main
a Saturday evening in April with a mist-like rain , and I was a little high on the good taste of life
a pocketful of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night
than an hour I had gotten a hotel , showered , shaved and was out on the Champs Elysees in a fresh uniform
like a Hun in Rome
women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ; everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes
some sweet machines other than women : an old Bugatti , a lean Farina coachwork on an American chassis , a Swallow , a type A40-AjK Mercedes and lots more
the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour d'Eiffel -- I was no yokel , but I was young , and this was Paris
champagne at Maxim's , then went into a cafe called the Jour et Nuit to ask the way to Montmartre
got there
Claire , which was better
eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine

know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful
blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress
ravenous eating wasn't grotesque because she was so positive about it
had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said : `` Handsome soldier , I have assuaged one hunger with food
another of terrible urgency
evening free ''
'' , I said with noblesse oblige because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah ''
off we went to her apartment
a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl
break of day I waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese
was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned
there on a Saturday evening
the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit
was busy but I didn't feel like a Hun
waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up
part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help me ) , then switched to Tuborg
few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was crocked
to my hotel and slept
morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning
drank more cognac
day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space
the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer
but sex
was on my mind
turning over the idea of a good debauchery when I dozed off
better Tuesday evening when I woke up
was clear , my thinking sober and I was reconciled to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others
binge has that kind of therapeutic value
the weather had turned cold and it was snowing
out into it
around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park , and I sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky
dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night
on only a topcoat , but I wasn't cold
just miserable
a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick
me and sat down beside me , three feet away
understood why she had the umbrella
her poise and posture
she would have been drab and limp
her propriety
her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle
imagine her without it
all about her
another human being and happened to be a hustler
much care if she were there or not
while she said with sort of an unuttered laugh , `` You have snow in your hair and ears ''
didn't have on a hat
glancing at her , I smiled a bleak one which said , Thanks , baby , but I'd rather be alone
silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy ''
not unhappy '' , I lied , staring at the snow
trying to make a hole in my armor , and I didn't want it
it a woman ''
gently
have seen the ring on my left hand
-- women and unhappiness go together '' , I observed profoundly , adding , `` You can wager your derriere on that ''
, Monsieur , it is not my business to wager it
took me so funny I had to look at her
my frozen sad face crumble , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped
snorted a chuckle
at me , but it was an awfully sad smile
even more miserable than me
were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them
isn't it better to smile ''

liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me ''
see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit
I pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of my topcoat , drew the cork , and passed it to her
see she was shocked
sorry I haven't got a glass '' , I said
, non '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry ''
up and drank , and then I drank
rotten to drink good cognac like that , but I hadn't cared before
going to lug around a glass
much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well
, this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty
be sure
was attractive
looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive
her , and all at once I was glad she was there
the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober
we were cold , but we didn't feel it
to be drowsing , sadly , soberly , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell
said , `` Allons '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word
no stranger in her
and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with Valery
thirty-five was the best estimate of her age
a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side
we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the rime had melted
wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy
was clear
hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital
jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips
good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up
to thirty , I thought
jour ''
, smiling
faim ''
, but breakfast first ''
laugh she beat me to the bathroom
downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her
out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my robe
brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast
toothbrush Monsieur '' , he said , presenting it
it to the woman
is this for ''
innocently
, to brush your teeth ''
I already have
yours ''
''
with round eyes
if I ought to go use the new one myself
smelled the coffee , and thinking , What the hell , live dangerously , I decided I would scald my worries away
wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good
the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread
ate , we talked
was Suzanne , and mine Stephen
back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee
are very tactful , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked
''
, sipping
, because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush ''
my eyes to look at her in the mirror
didn't really use yours '' , she went on
carry one in my purse
men never kiss les putains ''
immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` Shall we go to the Louvre today ''
right ''
with enthusiasm at the idea
not immediately ''
aside my empty cup
all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own
not rushed
is this from ''
, touching the scar on her stomach
like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle
bullet '' , she answered
was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and I wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all
sex anyway , and played at it well
to the Louvre for a few hours , then by Metro to a cabaret in Montmartre
a nice place , not filled with smoke
champagne and steamed mussels
brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle I had ordered
have thought I was a tourist
him with a steely eye and said , `` What's this for
ask for a Jeroboam of champagne ''
that was pretty humorous , but I didn't laugh
had arrived for Miss Theresa Stubblefield : she put them in her bag
not stop to read them in American Express , as many were doing , sitting on benches or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street
her first day in Rome and it was June
sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead
mind's eye -- her imagination responding fully , almost exhaustingly , to these shores' peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked , aqueducts and tombs , here a cypress , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills
old Latin books returned to her : the Appian Way Today , the Colosseum , the Arch of Constantine
see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight
nursing various Stubblefields -- her aunt , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy illnesses ( everybody could tell you the Stubblefields were always sick ) , Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot
France , Germany , Switzerland , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics , she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight , to see all these places with her own eyes
night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go
to stop me now
it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly noisy
street the traffic was really frightening
taxis , buses , and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain
tourists went by her in national groups -- English school girls in blue uniforms , German boys with cameras attached , smartly dressed Americans looking in shop windows
be alone , Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left
Steps
was going on here just now -- the annual display of azalea plants
heard about it the night before at her hotel
not yet complete : workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above
were as large as shrubs , and their myriad blooms , many still tight in the bud , ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink , along with many white ones too
thought Theresa , climbing in her portly , well-bred way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything
, all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed
the staircase she stopped and sat down
were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above , watching the azaleas mass , or just enjoying the sun
with her letters in her lap , breathing Mediterranean air
warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches
her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette
; ; how could you be both at once
but she was
she picked up the first of the letters
moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay
, one of them would have to go and do this
Elec , she thought , tears rising to sting in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer
on earth did I ever get this letter anyway
reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her
Emma Carraway had written it , in her loose high old lady's script -- t's carefully crossed , but l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope
had simply put Miss Theresa Stubblefield , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor
address whatsoever
scrawled American Express , Piazza di Spagna
the envelope , and now Theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the President of the Republic or the Pope
all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander Carraway
and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago
before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died
to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh
would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it
the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother George
George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec's funeral
full of heavy family reminiscence
fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today
children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his grandchildren ( he had one so far , still in diapers ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all
of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand

boy , the family darling
her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong
seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George
just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull
Cousin Alexander Carraway , the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma's call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George
all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot
hobbled downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his bathrobe , on a footstool
his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey
surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan
you think of anything to do ''
repeating
hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to
think of anything to do ''
might treat it like the hiccups '' , said Papa
a cold key down his back ''
just hope this happens to you someday '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best
Cousin Elec '' , George said
younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused
Cousin Elec ''
here they both were , still the same , George full of round-eyed woe , and Cousin Emma in despair
to a new page
course ( George's letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered
is alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it
Beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here , but I think she feels that she might be an imposition , especially as long as our Rosie is still in high school
possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka is populated with -- Miss Edna Whittaker , for example
is more in this than meets the eye
bathroom would certainly have to be put in
in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off
Theresa skipped a page of details about the house
I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them
settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best
really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick
sneezing in a minute , sitting on these cold steps
up , standing uncertainly for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men
shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick
they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so
a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos , Parker fountain pens , rosaries , papal portraits
'' , said Theresa
, no ''

did not wish to leave
how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them
in the park , the Colosseum by moonlight , he specialized
away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two
walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister , while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed American lady , carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag , ascending the steps alone
ever successful , Theresa wondered
with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ; at last , alarm
about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed
she scurried away up the steps
, still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between Cousin Elec's death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma
even , Anne and George , probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in August to get Cousin Emma's house ready before the teachers came to Tuxapoka in September
, it wasn't Anne and George's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't know what they would do without Theresa
is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist
not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow
registered with them that I had time to read all of Balzac , Dickens , and Stendhal while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after Mother's operation
have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all twenty-six volumes of Elsie Dinsmore
the letters carefully , one on top of the other
with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two

aware that two Italian workmen , carrying a large azalea pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display

Oh put it there ''
a spot a little distance away
it as surely as everybody in Westfield -- that Lucille was a husband stealer
keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus
been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren
it has its Susan Dolan , though nobody'd ever bothered to tell me that
, that's me
talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians' League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission
heard my folks talk about her , though
good-living religious people , and I can truthfully say I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody
they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me
and my faith protected me from things like that
I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren
him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck
him if it was true
me a straight , honest answer
, Sue baby '' , he'd said
I love you -- well , a guy's a guy and Lucille's willing to -- to come across
kitten , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much ''
it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren
didn't seem fair
for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex
a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line
a vivid , sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff Dad had ordered
in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men , but the moment I saw Johnnie , I knew he was different
only different -- he was it
an easy masculine grace about him , the kind that kids don't have , but that I had sometimes admired in other older men
was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp
unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too
hardly believe such good luck was mine
Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him
she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie
like it one bit
could I do
had to have his release -- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school -- and I wasn't providing it for Johnnie
his wife
have , even if he'd asked her
wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will
wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that
too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy
me and wanted me
only love I was giving him was the pure kind
weeks before we even kissed for the first time
folks' wishes , we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck
were tame enough -- mostly we talked
the time the first crackling of spring came around , we both knew we were hopelessly in love
then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little
so crazy '' , I told him once
always imagined I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that
no vices
''
you fall for a lumber jockey ''
drinks far too much ''
smokes too much ''
'' , I was ticking off the items on my fingers , `` swears too much and goes out with the boys , whoever they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold ''
his nails carefully
could walk out the door ''
you dare ''
never show my face or my truck around here again ''
wasn't looking at me
wouldn't ''
I could visit Lucille Warren ''
wouldn't

''
noncommittally
might ''
he was seeing her
admitted it to me
miserably beside him in the truck
all my doing -- his seeing her
I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it
, Johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me
he had said , `` All right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be ''
had I done , trying to keep us pure
driven him into the arms of that scheming woman
just the same as delivered him into the hands of the Devil
week later , I surrendered to him in the little motel on Route 10
first time
desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren
though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered
him , with a terrifying fierceness
, it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me
me , Johnnie ''
will , kitten ''
in the summertime fields behind the motel , a thousand crickets serenaded us
you always love me this way ''
huh

''
snuggled closer to the man I loved
as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced
had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no certificate of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them

can't be wrong , can it
''
on one elbow
worrying
wrong if love is real ''
great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness
, complete contentment
, I later discovered
no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious upbringing
always resisted the passes made at me by other kids , and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about
also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married
practically a bride , after all
have been a ceremony if it had been possible
, I had no doubt
do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness
he would
only told me so , he'd proved it
Johnnie's fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable
he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too
I could contribute to that , I'd do it
didn't matter
is too high when true love is at stake
had no doubts about how true this love was
even petted with a boy , and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the longest while , not until I all but threw myself at him
plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half
a mere twelve years matter
, I was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity
I rescued him from Lucille Warren
gotten him , if I hadn't stopped her
, Lucille Warren was a husband-stealer from way back
been a good girl and now God was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared
only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring
me ''

''
and always , Johnnie ''
''
''
in Boston
wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow
entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming , members of the Young Christians' League , and I'd been chosen to represent our chapter
mixed emotions about going
seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but I still didn't want to leave him for five whole days
had looked forward so much to being with this church group
been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever
to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group
went to Boston
meeting was held in Faneuil Hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states
Alma , at whose home I was staying during the convention , introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island
them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named Ronald , a boy about my age with slick , blond hair and dancing blue eyes
very different from Johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me
so , and he mentioned it , and Alma said so too
meeting , there was going to be a party at someone's house
Alma would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated
hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow
, there , beautiful twin of mine '' , Ronald said
a pumpkin to get to the party ''
help laughing with him
, I should find Alma '' -- I began
, Schmalma
with me ''

time we arrived , the party was already going strong
of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and I realized they were drinking
wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie
liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning
Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I enjoyed it
I enjoyed 'most anything if I did it with Johnnie
suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening
was only natural , I decided ; ; surely he was still resting snugly in my heart
don't see Alma anywhere '' , I said
invisible tonight
let's find out where they're keeping the glasses ''
back
-- I don't think so , Ronald
me ''
, come on ''
-- really ''


least come along while I get lubricated ''
was jammed
, most of them , and I wasn't even sure all of them had come from the League meeting
circumstances , he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs
he looked like an Astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach
he thought
of orange juice would make everything seem better
around his little Eden : bureau , bed , table , chair , two-burner stove
remembered
share a refrigerator '' , Mrs. Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in pelting rain , that had sounded reasonable
cold light of day , it seemed a lunatic arrangement
, maybe -- but share refrigerator
explained it -- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units
was the thing
seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables
yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` curving veranda '' between Unit Number Three and Unit Number Four
still raining , and Mrs. Kirby's cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and magenta
his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green pills , his spirits as damp as the day
had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it
a full month '' , the doctor had said
of sun , lots of rest
pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound
a sleeping capsule
will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked
men get to be my age , you won't take flu so lightly ''
accepted the diagnosis without comment
could call it anything from flu to beriberi ; ; but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it
loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever , which was really piling it on
caught , too , like an ailment , a confirmed distrust of women
-- scalded , really , because Vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy
on , his was going to be a man's world : the North Woods , duck blinds at dawning , beer and poker and male secretaries
he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet , the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery
damp circumstances , he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia
up to see Mrs. Kirby , awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker , bearing down on him
blow ''
triumphantly
noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists
, day after tomorrow '' , she added
hope so '' , he said
got this cold
bake it out in the sun ''
''
him briefly
got a peaked look
in out of the wet ''
to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , Peony being less than weatherproof
its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever
imagine her at this minute , honeymooning in Nassau with what's-his-name , lounging on golden sands , looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss
could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a salami sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long
through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the Bobbsey Twins ( At the Seashore , At the Mountains , On the Farm , and In Danger ) and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle , hideously illustrated
, only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin
a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy
thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four
about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind
, he found a note in the refrigerator
you mind wrapping your onion ''
note
smell permeates everything ''
the sweater , a lipstick case , and a squirt bottle of Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion
paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine
he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol
`` Sorry '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` Don't you eat ''
want to encourage anything here ; ; but on the other hand , he didn't want her swiping his salami
onions '' , came the answer the following day
''
really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen
, as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense

take Vivian

if this were Vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink
be black or white or horse-blanket plaid , chic and splashy , like Vivian herself
Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy
does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator ''
aloud

Mrs. Kirby , making her toilsome way along the veranda , laden with a clattery collection of mops , brushes , and pails
that you say ''
, nothing
the rain's stopped ''
, yes
at that sky
scorcher by afternoon ''
hope so
this cold ''
you said ''
him
, you're peaked
to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash , first sunny day
remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur
kind's the worst ''
kind , Charlie thought
inviting description
, neither was peaked
hear Mrs. Kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn
spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say
that peaked kind ''
was a better word
in the mirror
iron-poor
more closely
feeble -- peaked
two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good
, blazing hot as prophesied , was far from kind to Mrs. Kirby's varicolored properties
came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators
, he thought , he would look around for some more subdued retreat , with Cape roses , maybe , at the door
not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony , Larkspur , and the rest
was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes
she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes
a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest '' on the wrapping
him a good feeling

, was her answer the next day
was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript : `` You're not at all well , are you ''
got this cold '' , he wrote
it was any of her business
none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my Aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be ninety-six
, she's still living , and she's ninety-six
you try that ''
don't have a lemon ''
to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper
next morning , she had turned the paper over
, neither do I ''

sound like a pale girl
a little like a redhead
, redheads are often pale
his head in Mrs. Kirby's little rental office
guess that redhead next to me took your advice
seen her on the beach ''
won't , if you're looking for a redhead
browny hair ''
that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit
pink bathing suits on blondes , and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits
a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits
a dune , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting
little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , turtle-neck sweaters
beach , there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls
saw them all as he walked up and down
that morning , he was still walking -- up and down Peony , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , moonlit beach
in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note
got this sunburn '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion
don't mind ''
course I don't mind '' , she answered
having a miserable time , aren't you
the lotion you want , and for goodness' sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days ''
a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided
a fine quality in a woman
, for instance , was not too long on sympathy
, and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ; it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own
know what was so tough about Vivian's world , slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name
got a sunburn
see Vivian offering any hand lotion
peel him , once the worst of the agony was over
the next two days in his pajama bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to subside , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion
back and forth
your sunburn now
thing , this lotion has glycerin in it , and that whitens the skin , so if you're so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it ''
not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair ''
Mrs. Kirby
she told you I was puny , too
cold ''
out
say you were puny

''
goes with pale and peaked
have anything to read while you're shut up
two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness , and a book called ' Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe ' ; ; but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister
canoe ''
a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot
Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop
few innings the Anniston team couldn't figure him out
in the fifth , Anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field
, Riverside's redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him
cut over to center from left field to get the relay
up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil

''

around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan's hands on third base
the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag
Anniston boy had begun his slide too late
into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face
bastard ''
catcher screamed
to his feet and started to throw punches
tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher
in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar
were separated in a few minutes
was resumed
Deegan was boiling mad now
inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout
, coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink
was standing beside it , facing the field
eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began
your eyes open , sonny ''
to the catcher
in for trouble ''
catcher did not reply with words
turned to Mike and smiled
infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard
me God , I'll get him ''
said : `` Why don't you leave him alone ''
your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said

into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble
answer was in his eyes
smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips
last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's head
time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home
fielder threw and it was a good one
had no chance of being tagged
catcher was straddling home plate
had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher
heavily to the ground
got to his feet
back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back
players and their manager ran out on the field
water over their catcher's face
not move
manager called for a doctor
physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer
quickly , and a little nervously , the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room
was sitting on the bench , watching
ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch ''
, seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench
manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout
followed by four of his men
to look as if something was going to happen
quietly watching the manager come nearer
moved over to Mike Deegan's side
said a word
manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike
was flushed
'' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering
was a rotten thing to do ''
God's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away
it , will you
guys not to block the plate ''
didn't have to ram him ''
what you say ''
manager looked at Eddie Lee
a cold and calculated look
and went back across the field to his dugout
in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston
started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat
the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting
ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike's head
into the dirt , the ball going over him
slowly and brushed himself off
back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again
the bum ''
from the Anniston bench
Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil's ear : `` There's gonna be a fight ''
at those bastards ''
, a pitcher , said
looking for trouble ''
slow getting into the box this time
finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in
''
to the pitcher
more and I'm coming out there ''
be waiting ''
yelled back
pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat
flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now
wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head
, got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound
tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan
both walking towards each other , unhurried
Anniston players rushed out on the field
next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog
much shouting and screaming
up and were quickly squelched
the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together
and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started
game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in
a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help him in a fight ''
and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head
sat down on the bench near Phil
players were undressing quietly
had not come in yet
over to Phil and stood over him
the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me ''
didn't think it was necessary ''

just fine
think it was necessary ''
both his hands on his hips
his jaw forward
, wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy ''
a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face
didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly
else did , either ''

not trying to say anything ''
away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff ''
banged his locker door shut and spun around
anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room
, come into my office '' , Eddie said
Eddie into the office and shut the door
down before Eddie's desk
doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly
get your unconditional release as of today ''
widened just a trifle
best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home
belong in professional baseball ''
to clear his throat
this because of what happened out there ''
'' , Eddie said
it does confirm what I've suspected all along ''
up

the second time
Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said
not saying you're yellow
saying you're not a professional ballplayer ''
leaned forward over the desk
listen to me , Phil
steering you wrong
got the heart for baseball ''
his head and Eddie frowned
voice grew hard
the hell do you think baseball is
in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there ''
to say something but Eddie cut him short
don't tell me what a good ball player you are
you've got talent
you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with
, Phil
haven't got the heart for pro-ball , and that's it ''
Phil said : `` I don't get it
average '' Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly
difference does your batting average make
fielding average
the way you run bases
you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it
I mean by no heart for the game
cinch
no business ramming into that kid out there
it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on
hell do you think baseball is

way of life , goddamit
got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you ''


his opinion
other clubs in this league
up slowly
a little pale and shaky
felt glued together
think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally


your pay in the morning ''
and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` Someday you'll see I was right ''
the door behind him
the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes
happened ''

: `` I got my release ''
crazy ''

for ''

his head
don't get it ''
don't know '' , Phil said
silent for a few moments
said : `` What are you gonna do ''
to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again
off one shoe and stared at it
take it like this '' , Frankie said
, plenty of guys get let out and come back later
are full of guys like that ''
very quiet
are you gonna do , Phil ''
not answer
not try another club ''
up
hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that
in tomorrow '' , Frankie said
to Whitey Jackson ''
didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that
you do it , Phil ''
what ''
Whitey for a job ''

'' , he said
come in tomorrow ''

speak to Whitey ''
boy ''
talk to him , all right ''
worry '' , Frankie said
get a job there
outfielders bad ''
not worried about it '' , Phil said
the way to talk
did Eddie have to say ''
'' , Phil said
interest seemed the product of his insularity
reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him
was twelve he took to reading St. Augustine and Aquinas , then Lao-tse , Confucius , Mencius , Suzuki , Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers
birthday , because Richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the Zend-Avesta and a little image of the Indian god , Acala
day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The Book of the Dead , which she suspected Richard would enjoy
enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read
one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god ''
you think there were two ''
father
don't understand '' , Richard said gloomily
laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard ''
spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again
in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs
still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in Asian studies
a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his remoteness , a thorough if bookish knowledge of Asian lore , literature , life , politics and history
awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of Acala , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country
at home was not comfortable
, who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted
to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested
you still have The Book of the Dead ''
him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it ''
'' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it ''
no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject
The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York
dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames
sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried
America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of Acala and , on the freighter which took him to Japan , he plucked at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard
second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure
from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water
so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it
as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind
Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend
student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her
nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo
, Richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which , after a fashion , he envied
, he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity
him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations
such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at Ryusenji today
ever been to Ryusenji ''
had
, it's at Fudomae and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool
thoroughly startled ''
it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but Charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it
the four persons present , all foreign students in Tokyo , had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese foods by the In and Out system , an equation in which Zen philosophy was used as the modifier
udon and tea were In because they could be taken noisily
Out because it was pretentious
In , Samuel Burns had suggested , because it was too far Out to stay Out , even if it was a little pretentious
kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears
wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte
you watch him ''
red-haired girl named Ceecee Witter
shouldn't have been able to do that ''
I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of irritation
a minute , anyhow
no one has been there
there a number of times
I thought you knew everything about Tokyo
been to Ryusenji ''
heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said
a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki ''
, a little parkish place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` Anyhow , it's all very nice
man who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried there , next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo
that's what I meant to tell you
the interesting part , Richard '' , she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking
was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' -- `` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns
or twenty-three ''
the water would be still colder '' , Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it
your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath
kill one of us ''
the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire ''
eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light
true ; ; Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala
went on but Richard stopped listening
himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall
almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching
sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together
, after leaving Charlotte's apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room
at last did go to his room , he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of Acala , thinking first of Charlotte's tale of the man at Ryusenji , then of his biwa and the invisible Pacific waters
next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to Fudomae and walked to Ryusenji
surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned
through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool
hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon
creature , housed in wire , made him shudder
he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach
the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him
little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze ; ; but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest
he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head
Fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught by the Fudo's in fascination , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo's face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it
flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently
emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple , never looking back
all the miles back to his room
to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot
home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at Ryusenji
process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day
lingered , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal , the wretched sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life
the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at Fudomae
thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings
grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water
usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along , to play with
that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips
ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time
turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there
half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch
was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly
slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further
never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful
multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly
of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all
the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without fright or concern
the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it
did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly
it , looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby's fist down its back , and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black
were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm
were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly
and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth
, I said , I couldn't kill you
much too beautiful
killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die
him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make
caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body
him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands
worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods
, burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target
good and satisfied , looking at the snake
in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself
and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and uncolored field
on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks
my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house
was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake
it all at a glance
was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience
that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , I could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy
see the hunched-up shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick
, I shouted , but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say
the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance
no use
myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late
the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on
began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish
the anger mount within me
waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning
the boy well
eleven and we had done many things together
a beautiful boy , really , with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face , and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike , and his eyes were blue
there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day
my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well
then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where I had been not long before
the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me
I ride around with you ''
, as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me
closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ; the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his
, you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me
to the splintered , upright stake
you do that ''

'' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement
killed a snake ; ; it was a big one ''
to take my hand to show me
did you kill it ''
are ugly and bad ''
snake was very beautiful
see how beautiful it was ''
are ugly '' , he said again
saw the colors of it , didn't you
ever seen anything like it around here ''
are ugly and bad , and it might have bitten somebody , and they would have died ''
know there are no poisonous snakes in this area
could not harm anything ''
eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said
are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes ''
are talking foolishly '' , I said
killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason ''
ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted
likes snakes ''
was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself
skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done
of the colors was gone ; ; there was a contorted ugliness now ; ; the colors of its back were dull and gray-looking , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes
head , so delicate and so cool , had been flattened as if in a vise , and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted , torn mouth
was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life
the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals
it and the coolness , the ice-feeling , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles , and I hoped that it was truly dead , so that I would not have to kill it
it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there
stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips
, I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful
the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live
came around behind me , dragging the stake
a big snake , isn't it ''

going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed ''
you see what you have done ''

you see the difference now ''
an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said
up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes
see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the gleeful brutality
'' , I said
have slapped the boy
up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side
, you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes
to slap his face , to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do
come unglued easily , but this had not been a day of glad tidings
, production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own alma mater , a real snapper
he had enrolled his son four years ago
the boy's credentials were in order -- scholastic transcript , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards
to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership
lit his pipe with no comfort
it
the letter which would or would not enroll his son , David , in Hanford
who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life
who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief
if he had played it wrong
should have kept in touch
for reunions
had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford , Class of 1935
Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the old-grad-type
help anyway
Pete Alcorn , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years
was rejected
, Little Ivy League , had no room for football players with low grades
at his own son's scholastic record with pride
B average with a sprinkling of A's in math and science
son being that good in science
could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford
, he hadn't studied very hard
president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking
down his pipe and started to type
response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership ''
and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College
have to be told his son looked like him
the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness
6'

excellent
back to the typewriter with a little more confidence
interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming
motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to '' -- Mr. Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , ruining the letter
to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build
you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do
have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor
you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself
him time , give him a chance
the Venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head
production to make of a letter commending your own son
went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic
Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics
Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities
to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club
with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter
that did it
met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to David's
the unsealed letter into his coat pocket
it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything
, his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products
a way with words
it was natural , half was Smith College
whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college
had it or she didn't
it
what she meant and let it be
got on his back
take the advice or leave it
as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator
look like you just heard a real gasser , Mr. Partlow ''
at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years
was just thinking how things have changed
went to college they begged you to come
guest
pleasure
have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge ''
open the door to the lobby
a fact , Mr. Partlow
applied to six colleges before he got in ''
to State ''

of the rocket club here , you know
around with science stuff
along those lines , you might say
a science scholarship to Yale ''
'' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom
''
drove home through the thinning traffic , Cady felt the unease growing
told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David
all turned down his son
leadership



motivation

realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini Anne had waiting for him
his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket
looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did
looking at Anne
did
her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose
navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did
could sense the shag end of a woolly day
meeting tonight , Cady ''
, I begged off
do ''
I have the car , Dad ''
not let him take it , Cady
it is midweek , but it's only eight days before commencement
the rules ''
deep in thought , neither heard nor answered

put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` Mr. Chairman ''

two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest

the question

on his sports coat and picked up the car keys

her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room
didn't know I looked so dilapidated ''
word , darling
has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it

a way , yes
hasn't decided on Dave's application yet
a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership
I wrote ''
her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence
could feel Anne's questioning eyes
know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days
when half the school was down with flu ''
he was president ''
he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club

his jaw out
fact remains he was treasurer ''
the swimming team
Cady , he made second team

don't think you've been quite honest , Cady
like you


mad about stars at the age of nine
You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago
his interests now ''
do you suggest ''
say he likes swimming , tennis , chess and music ''

slightly mollified
right
refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts ''
and Cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck
I am padding it a bit , Anne '' , he said
you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college
to have leadership as well as grades ''
the worrisome document
you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend
used it now for several years
really say his motivation for college is electronics ''
the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel
what would you say he wants to do
''
Dave who is applying to Hanford College
you ask him ''
Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back
have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession
be guilty of trying to run his life ''
up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild
because your father tried to make a banker out of you , you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off
you've wanted him to conform to your mold

the block to the mailbox , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne
it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all
begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions
of white cotton shorts ruled his life
at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind
rose in the morning , the image was still there
always been a messy and negligent man
bachelor days , his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order
Dolores resented following in their footsteps
was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug
an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up
he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things
the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party
curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals
was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness
sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair
her back , pressed on the column of vertebrae , which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a tulip
to put it bluntly , nothing snapped
had not seriously troubled him , not then

could take at leisure
thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put
later that they had made their marriage too quickly
too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting
left themselves too much to discover
at the start , his new life felt invigorating

on the tenth day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon
he dropped the shorts on the floor
, I'm not going to pick up those shorts ''
her a teasing pat
think you'll get tired of them there ''
morning the shorts were where he had left them
to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did
almost too easy
had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests
would not be on the floor when he came home that evening
wrong
of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness , but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts
the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face
that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous
determined to foil her
be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ; my nerves are as strong
to the bedroom when the doorbell rings

early
standing a few feet from the front door
around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away
motionless in the doorway
not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts
his back
to answer the bell
was deposited in the hall closet
most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led Anthea to the bedroom
his ears
he could not be sure
caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there
of giggles slid over their voices
Anthea favored him with odd , coy looks
had been instructed `` not to say a word ''
reason , this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic
there was a void no one could fill
went home early
, later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night
as possible
was so taken aback , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in
contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant
he surrendered after raving at her

ran up the white flag altogether

the sober possibility
head was the echo of those titters with Anthea
something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean
his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening
even recall the last time he sat there
talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` Afterwards Martin said he was sorry
so sweetly , I couldn't keep being annoyed with him ''
even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ; he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it
mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , pallid ears
had to be fought
best sex win
resolution hardly seemed to help
situation had been bad , it now got worse
time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough
wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away
were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by
people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment
, the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts
curious how the different visitors took this
to ignore the blot on the bedroom's countenance

few laughed
all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale
a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course
waited in the living room
went along
the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing
of the guests showed his merriment
were in a hurry , weren't you ''
have liked to break the man's neck
; ; she let the interpretation stand
heard himself give a snort of mock good nature
eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It's a little contest -- Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment
up a rigid pretense of speaking relations
seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything
talk about
picking up any of his clothes ( except the fatal shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions
into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets , so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers
alone remained
moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying
of their amazement
He could hear the word
bizarre situation
up to visit them and He had thought her exactly what he wanted
of marriage and I'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously
idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now
know why ; ; he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure
trapped
night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself
scurried frantically , seeking an exit
had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly , morosely , to live out his life in this fashion
change , nothing would ever change
solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before
frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan
shorts , he would place something of hers
would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same
that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor
he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts
later , Dolores would crack
other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment
that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story
, he thought , would become less gay
used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness , his lack of control , his general male looseness , while she remained cool , airy , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body
her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd
the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and virility were involved , because it was truly his
kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism
morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of nylon lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts
down on the bed
surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared
delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments
deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second
he thought , she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too
that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him
fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room
not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady
together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible
Martin thought , That'll save
for work in high spirits
relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks
that he no longer hated Dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling
old A-Z '' , Cap said
know , I've got one of your cars at home
prominent industrialist , you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group
racket down your alley ''
was , William thought
any more
of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap
he start on such a ride to brief glory
, through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law
draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were responsible for his first eminence , but Fearless Freddy Bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time
a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by Gerry , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one
bought Zenith Plastic Products , a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position
, Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas
patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; he generally heard Freddy's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns
Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren
to aid Freddy with her father , prodded , no doubt , by Joan's open contempt for Freddy and William's irritating competency
must have been the eventual disposal of Willis' fortune ; ; she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death
reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith
another electronics factory , a specialized ceramics company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators
were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam Herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections
power , Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer
, slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him
Auto Company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism
a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and Freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences
blessing , he was convinced that Allstates' Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind
point William came into the picture
much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith
routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities
, eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington
end , he said : `` I'm not enchanted by the proposition , sir
a guy named Jack Hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with Chrysler , and I took him with me to Allstates
expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind
will cost a fortune
, I'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the Air Force
Adam Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side
thrown everything up for grabs , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here
of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade -- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes
the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough
a few facts and figures I've assembled
stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles ''
at the bound pages given him and shrugged
'' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know

deeply committed to our plans already
me he has people to handle the money raising , and Ham Richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and Allstates are no problem
like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution ''
, I appreciate that
you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm lukewarm ; ; I've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to resent me
don't take care , the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides , brandishing their cudgels ''
is a frightful prospect , Bill ''

shouldn't mix commercial affairs with patriarchy , but in this case I have no choice
think about it
grateful to you , so grateful I wish you were my principal aide instead of Freddy ''
William's surprise , Freddy , Adam and Hamilton Richert prevailed ; ; allied to them was Gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was unwilling to interfere further
Allstates , stock transfers were arranged , and Freddy became president of the hyphenated combination
Hamrick , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for Shoals and Clay
about A-Z till , unhappily , he and Hamrick were proved correct
dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the deficit
beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end
plant turned out to be a white elephant
held in abundance fell sharply in value
a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation
Willis summoned William
were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I'm in something of a bind
doesn't appeal to me
to other defects , I'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment
see if you can help me ''
a long week end closeted with Hamrick
experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of A-Z's useless Wisconsin set-up , exposure to exciting conceptions of Hamrick's that nobody would buy , and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called Ticonderoga Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it
Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging
the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult
caught fire
could buy Ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if William could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money hurdle was not insurmountable
nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white
with him , William went to Mr. Willis
surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report
alternative is breathtaking '' , he said , `` and , I'm frank in saying , a bit mad
I was younger and less timid
I can't resolve this myself
to call in the brain trust
willing to run the gantlet
guarantee you a sympathetic audience ''
be in there swinging '' , William said , `` but in a way , sir , you've got to decide it yourself
the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage
follow anyone , it'll have to be you ''

should explain : there's more here for me than advocating my little dream , there's you
take a fall , or publicly back away
that

rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly

meeting , attended by Freddy , Richert , Herberet and the A-Z executive staff , with Mr. Willis presiding , William and Hamrick did indeed run the gantlet
and incredulity , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity
, my God '' , Ham Richert said , `` a little child shall lead them

an advertising hustler , I admit , but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere

fell
turned in Willis' direction
at William and slowly rubbed his hands together
feel I must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the onus later , if any , should fall on me -- I don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family
giving you a chance , Bill , but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance
to you ''
the in-laws have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and glared at William and Freddy in turn
out on William's forehead , whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell
table , Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger
showed pleasure
burly , red-faced , decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an Ivy League suit , Jack Hamrick awaited William at the officers' club
, boss '' , he said , and grinned
suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington episode ''
afraid not ''
among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco
seems that Barco , fancying himself a ladies' man ( and why not , after seven marriages
had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said : `` With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies ''
Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of Cal Barco
way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants
at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San Diego
in that direction and , at San Juan Capistrano By-the-Sea came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission Drive-in , eating a hot tamale
moment , Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search
, however , was missing , for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale
placed Barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning
was that Barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered
return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand dunes They're better off , I tell you I saved their souls ''
, commenting on Barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged -- that he was a more or less harmless `` nut ''
in his cell awaiting trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life
had failed because , when endeavoring to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood
authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to revive him ; ; but the old fellow , a lifelong teetotaler , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter
was that District Attorney Welch entered the case
of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity
reported to Welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide
to know why
knew
had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at
attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test
paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly : `` Barco , we've got the goods on you
a lot better if you come clean ''
Barco was evasive and shifty
Welch's relentless pursuit of the subject , Barco finally `` broke '' and started confessing to one murder after another
time Barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true
true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into headlines all over America as the hero of a great murder trial
jail officials to Barco's cell
Welch's chagrin , the police captain pooh-poohed Welch's credulity in Barco's confession
clearly a `` nut ''
strength , bravado , daring to commit murder
worm a murderer

for the first time since his arrest , a glint of spirit lit Barco's eyes
had been attacked
and rose to his feet
them
that so ''

, for ten years I've been murdering women
lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven
next day the police captain , in derision , organized what he termed `` Welch's Wild Goose Chase ''
it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in Hollywood
party consisted of the police captain , Welch , Barco , policemen with shovels , newspaper reporters , and cameramen
his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on
the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica
cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicated a location
given to dig
found
worried
captain chortled
boys cracked jokes and again Barco's pride was aroused
precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left
and gibes , the policemen again started digging
on edge
was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object
something here ''
digger
and everyone gathered around
, thrusting about with his shovel , now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's Hollywood sport shirts
was a mere fragment of the victim's remains , it was enough
wild with delight
grew as Barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another
Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him
to his head , and his ambition increased
apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power as D.A. to drag every possible sensation into the case
scandal which would provide more `` copy '' for Marshall's pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch
that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand
, the D.A. with devilish cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines : `` Viola's Multiple Romances '' `` Viola Lake an Addict '' `` Downfall of Another Film Idol ''
be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl
Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted
long before I sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for Viola's destruction
bitter and resentful toward her , personally resentful
fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward Viola's favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap
not rest until I had tracked the mystery down
here it is
over a year before , there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel
been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone
late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ; the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor
Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all politeness to her host
so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds ; ; while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as Fate would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch
sat there , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes
later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture Forum on `` The Civic Spirit of the Southland '' , in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to preside
his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed
noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds , he made his way to the Byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the rostrum
on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined
, aside from reflecting on Welch's political career , had all but wrecked his home life
rested until he discovered who the culprit was , and when he did , he vowed vengeance on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way
it was
innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion
first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked
first place , it was difficult for us to meet
be seen together , for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent
invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her
Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her
Mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles )
being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats
insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts
, it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi
went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school
long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home
such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother
arrived at Viola's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen
me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner
and watched proceedings
to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself
that Hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater
that was accomplished was adding Mrs. Beige's tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion
saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly
household hint : if you can't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone
if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick up the phone
Miranda twined themselves around me , murmuring endearments
onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency
to get out a cool , poised , `` Won't you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia
to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed
the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice
were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black out , Miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles
circumstances , I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that Hank and I be there
that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room
that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats
get something done , I started in on the dishes

saying it right
meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink
so formidable , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again , this time about Francesca and her husband
them , I thought
Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia
even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after I met Fran at a PTA meeting , and had taken us in hand socially
been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ; the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly thin )
`` personalities ''
an expert on narrow ties , thin lapels , and swatches , was men's fashion editor of Parvenu , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation
he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from Nebraska , or was it Wyoming
the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and , having arrived in New York with a big bank roll , became a dabbler in various fields
Greenwich Village artists for awhile , then put some money into a Broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful )
during her `` writing '' period that she and Herb met and decided that they were in love
married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in Parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they honeymooned in Bermuda
not Bermuda
not in style that year
honeymooned in Rome ; ; everyone was very high on Rome that year
bought their house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding New York ; ; they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names
are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , Fran had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but People Who Do Things ''
their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things
was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and updated , and added on to
a gourmet's corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud
all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time
boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences
Herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things )
her independence by rebelling against the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by wearing Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in colors ; ; bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes

though , they did not seem quite human
, indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement
only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ; even brand names

how a real , red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe
had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , valueless things
me , no ; ; not Blanche
minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the astringency of Grazie , who was a sort of Gwen Cafritz to Francesca's Perle Mesta
Grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever PTA or civic project was being launched
inseparable , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen rivals for social leadership

unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed '' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I legally inherited as Morris' helpless relict , was `` stung '' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings
also publicly reprimanded , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as The New Republic , The New Yorker , Time and The Christian Science Monitor

like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court ( 1937 ) , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` henchmen '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me
had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers , `` toadies '' and sycophants of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me
ready , like Portia , to present my own brief
Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case
was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out ''
my name was on all the front pages
, it seemed , persona non grata in every quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence
Evans Hughes said , `` Miss Poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant ''
was quoted as saying : `` The workings of the woman's mind amaze me ''
spoke of me as `` utterly astounding ''
wrote : `` Belle Poitrine is the most original thinker since Caligula '' , and even F.D.R. had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine , America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh ''
were the court costs prohibitive , but I was subjected to crippling fines , in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts '' which the government claimed that Metronome and I owed -- a severe financial blow
as Manny said , had the notoriety done my career `` any good ''
were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` robber baroness '' , and even `` traitor ''

now with pride to the fact that , long ere the Committee on Un-American Activities , the Minute Women , the Economic Council and other such notable `` watchdog '' organizations were so much as heard of , I was Hollywood's leading bulwark against communism , fighting single-handedly `` creeping socialism '' against such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA , PWA , WPA , CCC and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom F.D.R. employed secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular `` relief '' checks
say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period
do otherwise
I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled
distractions are hardly conducive to `` Oscar '' winning performances
my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe
through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieved stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all
`` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss Poitrine's co-star and `` helpmate '' had never learned his part
Letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , I was the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blaming others , going into `` sulks '' and , on more occasions than I care to count , storming off the `` set '' for the rest of the day
his finances , I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had `` salted away ''
I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even Letch's bills at his tailor and the Los Angeles Athletic Club
did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw
that is another story
for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing
once I was confronted by professional gamblers , `` bookies '' , loan `` sharks '' , gangsters , `` thugs '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to repay my husband's staggering losses , `` or else '' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu
three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children
deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband
, you're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family ''
made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter
felt it wiser to keep Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around
only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow
sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory
always works out for the best
I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I cannot say
heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse
I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him -- lovely dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host's chair was vacant ; ; a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ; a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn's , on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could
but a sampling of the insults I endured
Letch Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys
antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable `` screenland '' gathering
and 1939 Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it
joint venture , Sainted Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother Cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America's first saint in November , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish
was playing Mother Cabrini , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me
order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother Cabrini
he appreciate my efforts on his behalf
trouble to memorize the very small part which I had `` tailor-made '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches

not
shooting '' went on for eight months
our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` bookies '' , illegal gambling dens , a certain `` residential club for young actresses '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club
deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , uncooperative , rude and insulting
many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general
time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother Cabrini
Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable
Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood ''
was small consolation
rare fit of anger and spite , I `` farmed out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment
actor must have discipline
film was called The Diet of Worms , which I felt was just what Letch deserved
out to be a life of Martin Luther , of all things
a disaster
, Letch simply did not project
laughed off the screen
same time , however , I availed myself of the services of that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir Gauntley Pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called The Mystery of the Mad Marquess , in which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac
a `` potboiler '' made on a `` shoestring '' and not the sort of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal
was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most financially successful picture of my career
watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later
had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before
loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me
I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy '' , I said
is Letch interested in ''
, booze and babes '' , Momma said bluntly
stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference
can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , I said
date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it
his fault that these things were so
was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately
result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready
disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted
at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs

almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams
had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws
something to one's ego
constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys
how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference
became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture
the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons
couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns
the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to
him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day
wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it
the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case
possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed
be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with
the answer less metaphysical
people work more slowly
take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty
become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go
be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes
was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it
again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them
no compulsion behind them
be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn
his busy life he had only done things which had to be done
had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting
at the luminous dial of his wrist watch
five minutes after four
distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered
over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn
he could buy the equipment for his workshop
, action might follow
down to Mills and Bradley's Hardware Store and bought a full set of carpenter's tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were
bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and T squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for
'' , said Mr. Mills
get you started
to get everything at once
as you find you need 'em ''
even ask the cost of this collection
, if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that
returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , Jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car
glad
him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments
made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable
everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall
where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools
of it would be his workbench
nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away
the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall
one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter
pegboard there would be the paneling
down on an old box and focused on the problem
bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget
, when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again
seemed rather hopeless
his attention to the workbench
was the first thing to do
had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it
had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench
on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile
poked at it gingerly with his foot
anyone know what to do with an assortment like that
had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about
least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on
everything should be simpler
upstairs to phone Crumb
amazement he reached him
was laid up with a bad cold
seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly
trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job
why he hadn't been able to finish the porch
he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter
any such thing any more
wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job
a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way
to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk
would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night
was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie
had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr. Crombie's life since he moved to Highfield , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him
he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you
Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. Blatz's mind from funny things
same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance
Blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar
agreed that this would be pretty
discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste
'' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets for them power tools ; ; then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' I guess we're about through down here ''
did look very efficient and shipshape
no question of that
the way '' , said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage
you know about that
use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits
too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin' ''
being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved
the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools
Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs
, Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils
sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair
'' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there
be able to build a new house with all them contraptions ''
watched his wife with an anxious expression
was just sayin' to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done ''
couldn't remember his saying any such thing
, that's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie
have a thousand things for you to do
won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- '' `` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie
are the things I can do , now that I'm set up ''
been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said
won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- there'll be plenty more ''
discussion was academic
was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink
in English has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences
said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg
English by Greek ''
Sheridan said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two ''
witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning ''
many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies
parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds
of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition
you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said ''
, addressing Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we ''
exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours
a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in
terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend
wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me ''

wooden-leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations

came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device
you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on ''
see the girl but I don't see the car with slacks on ''
years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline

ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than Af inches ''
are also chockfull of misrelated constructions
the Reader's Digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a California paper that advertised `` House for rent
in five counties , two bedrooms ''
is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples

Daughter of Local Couple Married ''
misplaced modifiers and headlinese , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter
newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last Saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays ''
in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband ''
was the caterer's ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair

too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical
is so-called because its semi-ambiguous English always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say
He walked in upon her invitation
him passionately upon his reappearance

good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese
items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs
Henry Morgan was escorting Miss Vera Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan on the public square ''
recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` The area in which Miss N -- was injured is spectacularly scenic ''
meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields
witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach ''
, this always brought the house down
journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature

many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations

demurred
silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said
the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners , the girl reluctantly agreed
brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth
of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store

of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb
question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered
night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time
asked , `` Do you object to petting ''
one thing I've never done '' , she said promptly

'' , she smiled , `` objected ''
requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre

ambiguous case read as follows : `` The bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction

comedy of indefinite reference , it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence

the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic -- his mother was born in Ohio -- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson Downs , raising hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor
friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind
became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly
place is in the hive ''
have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand
seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live
go to their funeral ''
was wrong '' , I admitted
didn't die , it just went crazy
identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate
have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes , magazines known as Horror Comics , and sick comedians
even publications called Sick and Mad
is not crazy as a loon or mad as a March hare ; ; it is manic as a man ''
woke up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` paraphrasing Lewis Carroll
want to hear the paraphrase ''
I bear it ''
, taking a final gulp of my drink , and handing him the empty glass
barely '' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase : `` The time has come '' , the walrus said , `` To speak of manic things , Of shots and shouts , and sealing dooms Of commoners and kings ''
us each another drink , and said , `` For God's sake , tell me something truly amusing ''
try '' , I said , and sat for a moment thinking
yes , the other day I reread some of Emerson's English Traits , and there was an anecdote about a group of English and Americans visiting Germany , more than a hundred years ago
railway station at Berlin , a uniformed attendant was chanting , ' Foreigners this way
way '
-- she could have been either English or American -- went up to him and said , ' But you are the foreigners ' ''
a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy ''
the matter with the music ''

doesn't drown out the dialogue '' , I explained
talk about books '' , Moreland said
am told that in America you have non-books by non-writers , brought out by non-publishers for non-readers
all non-fiction ''
is non-fiction and non non-fiction '' , I said
of nonism : the other day , in a story about a sit-down demonstration , the Paris Herald Tribune wrote , ' The non-violence became noisier
Eichmann was quoted as saying , in non-English , that Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews was nonsense ''
we cannot tell evil , horror , and insanity from nonsense , what is the future of humor and comedy ''
, grimly

require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these
present era of Science and Angst , the heart has been downgraded , to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs ''
know what you mean '' , Moreland sighed
year your Tennessee Williams told our Dilys Powell , in a television program , that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart
everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged glands , and the jumpy central nervous system
pleading for the heart that leaps up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with rapture fills and dances with the daffodils
pure heart of Galahad is gone with the knightly years , but I still believe in the heart of the George Meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks ''
no longer have Tom Moore's and Longfellow's ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , I said
and Longfellow didn't have the fate that faces us '' , Moreland said
day our species promises co-existence , and the next day it threatens co-extinction ''
for a while drinking in silence
heart '' , I said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes

should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas , involving clergymen and parishioners , psychiatrists and patients
becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas from the modern theatre ''
you think we need a new Henry James to re-explore the Anglo-American scene ''

perhaps a new Noel Coward ''
you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of James and the antic heyday of Coward
hear it said constantly -- in drawing-rooms
, there is usually a group of Anglo-Americans with tragicomic problems , worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire ''
up and began pacing
you are trying to get us out of the brothel , the dustbin , the kitchen sink , and the tawdry living-room , you are probably wasting your time '' , Moreland told me
many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock ''
and furiouser '' , I said
am worried about the current meanings of the word funny
means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor ; ; disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; ; and frightening , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights ''
brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink
his glass , clinked it against mine , and said , `` Toujours gai , what the hell ''
line from Don Marquis' Mehitabel
careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change
means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said
, I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance
by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was non-institutionalized ''
went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; then he turned to me
it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species ''
, that is demonstrable '' , I told him
you remember the woman in the French Alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously
the sheep , ' The world is coming to an end '
sheep said -- all in unison , I have no doubt -- ba-a-a
mockery of sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh ''
is only partly non-nonsense '' , he began
you saw the drama called Rhinoceros '' , I said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros
would panic , screaming help
that can be screamed in their language ''
think the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy ''

, no '' , I said
political and intellectual Left began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as satire and irony , such as humor and comedy
like any other human being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , Khrushchev , the anti-personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has
famous meeting with Nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed Wynn
like Caesar , he has only one joke , so far as I can find out
in saying , ' That would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage
the name of his non-God doesn't he vary it a bit ''
as ''

as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being to save humanity ' ''
and I have fallen out of literature into politics '' , Moreland observed
a nasty fall was there ''

over to stare at his peacocks again , and then came back and sat down , restively
world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free '' , he said , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy-free
age of Science and Angst it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space ''
human ego being what it is '' , I put in , `` science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats
to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species ''
we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , Moreland protested
in the largest sense of the words '' , I said
other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else
we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else
ago an English writer , W. L. George , dealt with this subject in Eddies of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint George for Merry England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog-eating Frenchmen dead ' ''
was also Gott strafe Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago delenda est , or if you will , Deus strafe Carthage
what the ideologist believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy
the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state
not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad
a bitter satire for a future writer in that ''
satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said
we now find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non-poetry
a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about
, the children had wanted to get up onto General Burnside's horse
to see what his back felt like -- the General's
so comfortable being straight
to touch the mystery
boosting them up when the policeman came by
very rude
a hard voice , too , this time
eyes rather popped for a second ; ; but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it wasn't for these dear children '' --
got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all
is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on ''
so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir ''
walked on , but he looked back once
happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred
taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; and they had told their mother about the tumbles
of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ; and so they were consistently true to their principles
mind '' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups
mind
something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn ''
is it ''
children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable
was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene
you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie
they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time
Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults
protested that that wasn't any surprise
you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement
is a warm-up ''
it anything like cooked-over oatmeal ''
of the children
the least bit '' , Arlene snapped
the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions
especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest
sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously
hard for very long
enough to make you feel important
'' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable
, we're going to be like what General Burnside and his horse make us think of ''
looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever
went happily out of bounds
Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful
herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked
being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said
laughed and winked back
General Burnside's horse , upside down '' , Arlene said , sort of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position
General Burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down
she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling )
would wink and throw kisses
tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble
kept on clapping for a long , long time
time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing
has something to do with General Burnside and his horse ''
, it was so grand ; ; they could tell exactly what it was
General Burnside's horse running in a circle
shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders
the General's horse '' , one of them cried out
remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That's a funny old horse ''
one said , `` He sure does shake
''
was the General kissing his wife
to be told that one
was even funnier after they had been told
, when he came back from those many business trips , just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox
General Burnside
the funniest man
could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet
they had to get up and be General Burnside
horse
could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out
very funny
they said General Burnside was going to jump over his horse's head ; ; and they did some somersaults
wasn't very funny , either
ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them
showed them how to begin
taught them to sing `` I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate ''
a lot
clumsy , but they were beginning to catch on
caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling
you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , Arlene suggested
a great deal
a little late in getting home
sorry , Mrs. Minks '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it
constituted herself the voice of all of us
perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way
suppose you all were playing and forgot ''
, ma'am '' , the children chorused heartily
help laughing
rushed off to get rid of their sweaters ; ; and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open
a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ; but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded
had a slight bangish quality
really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed
lip lifted slightly
biting into a small red radish ; ; and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing
she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish
try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting
worked , naturally ; ; but it made her look unusual
when she had bitten off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; ; and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it
hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief
it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it
warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public
, the children told her further about somersaulting
must be awfully good for them
kind of Arlene '' , she told us later
do you know something curious ''

reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress
no notion why I reached
found a radish
an omen
for a second
would not pamper myself in that silly way
the window and threw the radish out ''
my mother blushed at this small lie ; ; for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain
indispensable ; ; nobody could have told why

as at this juncture , he did not
was always persuaded out

had left , I could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look
loathed him , too
, they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them
been some coconut in it , for I remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a shiver
pushed gently into the room by Arlene -- whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door
just sat down
Mr. Gorboduc what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , ceremonially
an air of revolt about the children -- even irreverence for their own principles
be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing , a horselike balkiness of demeanor
the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration
at the beginning , this stayed just in the air
go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said
have good times ''
bulletin convulsed Mr. Gorboduc
do ''
, between wheezes of laughter
forced to wipe his eyes
don't step on the flowers , do you

the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger
'' , he said
don't ''
took a swig of his sherry
so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs
this was done when attention was diverted by someone else's long , boring story
time she was nervous : she was open
was finally in command of his mind again
me -- what do you do at the park ''

delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over-pretended interest -- an admirable way with children
unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command
the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment
bump '' , one said ; ; and the other went on to development of the idea
grind , too '' , he said
was beside herself with curiosity
that again '' , she pleaded
a little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass

off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm
, probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate
and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-birifw- '' all originated in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism ''

and chancellor Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster cast of the Apollo Belvedere
have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with Freudian , Jungian , and Meinckian theory
, when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed through middle-Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina )
remainder of the movie , Chancellor Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a Venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag
manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the English at Dunkirk
find out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian blind
when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not ''
few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture
, needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer
of Bini SalFininistas , capital LP Ab63711-r , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer
who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed through his `` purgatory '' of neglect
, under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc Schlek , Jr. , a major revival is under way
leads the Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor's insistence
portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot
was Haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride
, to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F-major register up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage
have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance
itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the American theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance in that nebulous area known as `` off-Broadway ''
last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non-dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer
and , significantly , greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho's classic frog-haiku by Roger Entwhistle , a former University of Maryland chemistry instructor
play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention
centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee
relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor
that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie , gets a plate of English muffins instead
theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks Atkinson retired
still precocious , French feline enfant terrible Francoisette Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The Lascivious Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel
, pithy parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by Mlle Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over and over by four thousand French horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul Sartre

Bambi , and , more recently , Born Free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max Fink's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My Friend , the Quizzical Salamander
the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother's pet salamander , Alicia
not an entirely happy book , as Mrs. Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass
in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's disease and dies

heard that after seeing Mr. Quasimodo's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement

his own art as `` the search for what is not there ''

work , his use of non-color is startling and skillful

latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior

, disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art , or to shame you into rectitude
, rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict
unwittingly set in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them

doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly
Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria dell' Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises
the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there

descended one story , glommed a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom
curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade-handled magnifying glass
a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box Kodaks , you added to your haul
having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover
for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake
, aided by several clues I'll withhold to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector Javert , but before they close in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless
the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches
, these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's evil , sheep rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release
, though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it

amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; ; they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration
French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let's resume our catalogue
pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say
ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; ; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack
Indian brass deities , though -- Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna -- are an altogether different cup of tea
from Travancore , a state in the subcontinent where Kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped

is the wooden sculpture from Bali , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that I particularly call to your attention
, this is an amulet against housebreakers , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949
its base is a charm in Balinese , a dialect I take it you don't comprehend
I , but the Tjokorda Agoeng was good enough to translate , and I'll do as much for you
our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow
will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley car will grow in his stomach
and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot
of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation
remorseless , isn't it
there it is
you no doubt regard the preceding as pap ; ; you're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen

of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn ''
was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap
while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it
eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer's boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead
I probed into this young man's activities and character , the less savory I found him
, for example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet
was prodigious ; ; sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws
he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico & Paglieri's or Peter's Backyard drunkenly donning ladies' hats and singing `` O Sole Mio ''
, and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash timber
the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate , and in due course , as was inevitable , overreached himself

time we saw him , he was a changed person ; ; he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire

had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band

beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer
, deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the top
programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss

a living doll and no mistake -- the blue-black bang , the wide cheekbones , olive-flushed , that betrayed the Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage , and the mouth whose only fault , in the novelist's carping phrase , was that the lower lip was a trifle too voluptuous
